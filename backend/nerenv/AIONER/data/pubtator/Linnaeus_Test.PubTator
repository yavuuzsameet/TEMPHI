2567314|t|Syndrome of arachnomelia in Simmental cattle
2567314|a|Abstract Background The syndrome of arachnomelia is an inherited malformation mainly of limbs, back and head in cattle. At present the arachnomelia syndrome has been well known mainly in Brown Swiss cattle. Nevertheless, the arachnomelia syndrome had been observed in the Hessian Simmental population during the decade 1964-1974. Recently, stillborn Simmental calves were observed having a morphology similar to the arachnomelia syndrome. The goal of this work was the characterization of the morphology and genealogy of the syndrome in Simmental to establish the basis for an effective management of the disease. Results The first pathologically confirmed arachnomelia syndrome-cases in the current Simmental population appeared in the year 2005. By 2007, an additional 140 calves with the arachnomelia syndrome were identified. The major pathological findings were malformed bones affecting the head, long bones of the legs and the vertebral column. It could be shown that, with the exception of two cases that were considered as phenocopies, all of the paternal and about two-third of the maternal pedigrees of the affected calves could be traced back to one common founder. Together with the data from experimental matings, the pedigree data support an autosomal recessive mutation being the etiology of the arachnomelia syndrome. The frequency of the mutation in the current population was estimated to be 3.32%. Conclusion We describe the repeated occurrence of the arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental calves. It resembles completely the same defect occurring in the Brown Swiss breed. The mutation became relatively widespread amongst the current population. Therefore, a control system has to be established and it is highly desirable to map the disease and develop a genetic test system. Background In the year 2006 a syndrome was described in the German and Austrian Simmental (Fleckvieh, as it is locally called, is the main dual-purpose breed in Germany, in short called Simmental in the further text) population, that was pathologically similar to the arachnomelia syndrome in Brown Swiss cattle [1]. The congenital arachnomelia syndrome (AS, OMIA Phene ID 139, Group 000059) is mainly a malformation of the skeletal system in cattle that was initially described by Rieck and Schade [2] in Holstein Friesian, Red Holstein and Simmental. The main pathological changes are skeletal malformations of the legs, the spinal column and the skull. The legs are thinner and appear longer than normal (dolichostenomelia, arachnomelia) since the diameter of the diaphyses is reduced. These long bones are more fragile and, in combination with stiffened joints, they tend to fracture during calving. The fetlock joints are deformed, often stiffened and show hyperextension. The malformation of the spinal column leads to kyphosis and scoliosis. The skull malformations are characterized by a shortened lower jaw (brachygnathia inferior), convex rounding of the frontal bone leading to a marked stop ("pointer head") and rotation of the anterior cranium. In some cases, additional malformations like hydrocephalus externus develop [2-5]. Since the report of Rieck and Schade [2] no further cases were reported in Simmental cattle, but in the 1980s the syndrome was dispersed in another breed, the European Brown Swiss cattle, by the use of American Brown Swiss sires [4,6]. In Brown Swiss an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was supposed and a control program based on the identification of carriers by pedigree analyses was established [5]. Recently, four cases of arachnomelia syndrome were reported in Italy [3]. In this study, we present the data of 152 pathologically confirmed cases of arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental that were collected from October 2005 to March 2007. We describe the pathological findings, the familial occurrence and an estimate of the frequency of the diseases allele in Simmental cattle. Additional support for the mode of inheritance and the genetic basis of the arachnomelia syndrome is given by the result of experimental matings of obligate carriers. Results and discussion AS has not been reported again in Simmental since its first description in the 1970s, more than thirteen years ago. In autumn 2004 a number of stillborn calves with similar malformations of the legs and head were recorded within the monitoring system of anomalies in Simmental. Some of these calves were sent to the veterinary service laboratory for examination, and in December 2005 the first 15 cases of AS were pathologically confirmed. Subsequently, farmers and veterinarians had been encouraged to report cases by an information leaflet and various articles in local trade journals. An increasing number of suspected cases was reported and an additional 136 affected calves were identified by pathological examination by June 2007. Familial occurrence and case presentation of the syndrome of arachnomelia The geographical origins of the cases were the southern part of Germany and Austria, reflecting the regional distribution of the Simmental breed. Both sexes were equally represented in the 152 (80 male, 72 female, X2 = 0.21, p = 0.64) affected calves. The largest number of cases was registered in 2006 (Figure 1). In retrospect, it could be shown that the main reason for the rapid increase of cases in the years 2005 and 2006 was the high popularity of certain sires carrying the AS mutation (ROMEL, ISO-Nr. 276000911043667, born in 1995; EGEL, 276000915512806, 1985; REXON, 276000913008210, 1989). The latter two sires represent the key-nodes of the pedigree pathways of the mutation from the founder into the current population (Figure 2). ROMEL, for example, sired more than 40,000 cows 4 to 6 years ago. Furthermore, 115 sons of ROMEL born from 2001 to 2005 are registered and listed in the breeding database [7]. These progeny were now mated to ROMEL and sons or grandsons of EGEL and REXON resulting in a high probability for the occurrence of affected calves. Increasing awareness of the disease and abandoning of selling the semen from carriers led to a sharp drop of cases in 2007. The disease was successfully managed by efficient collaboration of the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture (LfL), the Landeskuratorium der Erzeugerringe fur tierische Veredelung in Bayern e.V (LKV), the Bavarian Animal Health Service (TGD) and breeding organizations. Pathological findings Calves under suspicion of the arachnomelia syndrome were sent to the pathology department of the TGD for macroscopic examination. The observed major pathological findings were (1) facial deformation, including brachygnathia inferior and concave rounding of the maxilla forming a dent ('pointer-head'); (2) abnormally thin diaphyses of the long bones (the outer diameter of the diaphyses is diminished, whereas the width of the substantia compacta is normal) leading to frequent fractures of the metacarpus and metatarsus in the course of forced birth assistance ('spider-legs', dolichostenomelia). The deformations of other bones of the legs were less apparent and the scapula was usually unaffected; (3) angular deformations of the distal parts of the legs characterized by bilateral stiff and hyperextended fetlocks with the extremity of the toe forward and parallel to the trunk of the body; and (4) defects of the vertebral column (kyphosis and scoliosis), but not of the ribs (Figure 3A-C). Additionally, inconsistent pathological findings included cerebral herniation combined with a malformed foramen magnum, microphthalmia, and external and internal hydrocephalus. The latter seem to develop secondarily, due to the enlarged foramen magnum. Histological examination of selected cases revealed the presence of hemorrhages at the osteochondral junction of the epiphysis and an abrupt transmission from chondral to osteogenic tissue. Cases never showed isolated malformations, e.g. of the head or legs, but usually a combination of all pathological findings that are characteristic for the syndrome. Nevertheless, the degree of the lesions ranged from obvious spider-leg cases to moderate or mild changes, making a definite diagnosis difficult. The latter cases (3) were excluded from the initial pedigree analyses. Meanwhile, an indirect gene test is available that has been developed at the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture (ITZ) and it could be shown that these cases are most probably not genetically affected (Buitkamp et al., in preparation). Carrier identification Two criteria were used for carrier identification. The first was the presence of a calf that was diagnosed by pathological investigation. In many cases more than one affected calf per sire was identified [8]. Some sires had only one affected calf, but a large number of risk-matings. In these cases a second criterion, the statistical evaluation of risk-matings, was used to identify potential phenocopies. For this purpose, the probability of observing only a single affected calf among a certain number of risk-matings of the sire in question was calculated. Risk-matings were defined as matings with direct progenies of identified AS carriers. The probability of observing an affected calf depends also on the probability that such a calf is reported to the LKV. We assumed this probability to be 50%. Under these conditions, the probability of observing only one affected calf is lower than 1.0 percent, if at least 104 risk-matings are given for a single sire. In this case it is very likely that the single affected calf is a phenocopy. In 2006 and 2007 this was the case for two sires used for artificial insemination that had no pedigree connection to SEMPER (see below). Experimental matings of obligate carriers Four out of seven cows that were known AS carriers brought to the facilities of the ITZ were used for embryo transfer (Table 1). 33 of the 60 recipients (55%) were confirmed pregnant on day 35. Four of the 33 pregnant heifers (12%) aborted between days 36 and 49 of pregnancy. Of the remaining 29 recipients, 6 were slaughtered on day 150, 6 on day 200, and 17 animals on day 225 of pregnancy (Table 1). Four fetuses (three male and one female) out of 29 (14%) showed the typical pathological changes of the arachnomelia syndrome as described above (Figure 4C,D). All other fetuses showed no signs of AS (Figure 4A,B). Male fetuses represented 76% (22 of 29) of pregnancies (X2 = 3.123, p = 0.077, Yates corrected for sample size <30). Female weight (Table 2), crown-rump length at day 225 and chest circumference at day 225 of normal fetuses were lower than that of male fetuses. Fetuses that were affected by the arachnomelia syndrome showed lower weight than normal fetuses. The affected and the normal fetuses had similar crown-rump length, but the chest circumference of affected fetuses was higher than that of normal fetuses (Table 2). Due to the small number of affected female fetuses, a comparison with unaffected animals for sex was not possible. To compare unaffected and affected animals in total, the data were analyzed for statistical differences by the non parametric Mann-Whitney-Test. The only trait that was significantly different between unaffected and affected fetuses was the chest circumference (p = 0.004, Table 2). The body weight of AS affected calves was tendentially lower than that of normal calves. Since affected calves did not have different crown-rump-length and their chest circumference was even higher, this can best be explained by a reduced bone mass. Pedigree Analysis and mode of inheritance Eight-generation pedigrees of all cases were extracted from the joint German and Austria pedigree data and screened for common ancestors. The pedigree of the majority of affected calves (paternal line 150, maternal line 106 out of 152, Table 3) could be traced back to one founder, SEMPER (ISO-Nr. 27000979299305), a sire born in 1964, 6-9 generations before the affected calves were born (Figure 2). Most of the affected calves inherited the AS mutation via REXON or EGEL (Table 3, Figure 2). In 44 cases the maternal paths were not linked to the common pedigree (Table 3). One explanation would be the existence of additional, hereto unknown origins of the mutation. This could happen if the AS mutation is much more ancient and additional pedigree paths exist or if an independent mutation event happened leading to the same phenotype. An alternative, more plausible explanation could be the occurrence of misparentages. It is well known that in the pre parentage-test era, the frequency of false paternity, especially of the cows, was reasonable high (up to 23% [9]). Therefore, there is a good chance of a false registry within 6-9 generations. There is strong support for the assumption that the AS is regulated by a single autosomal locus acting in a recessive manner. First of all, the pedigree structure of the affected calves in Simmental can best be explained by a recessive mode of inheritance. The paternal branch of the pedigree could be traced back to one sire, SEMPER, for all affected calves, the maternal branch in the majority of the cases. Inbreeding loops over a few generations are present in several pedigrees of affected calves, e.g. cases P3364 and P1787 (Figure 2). Sex-dependent inheritance can obviously be excluded and a dominant mode with reduced penetrance seems to be unlikely. Secondly, the experimental matings resulted in 4 affected and 25 unaffected fetuses, a result that most closely resembles the expectation of a recessive mode of inheritance. Thirdly, the occurrence of cases corresponded well with the numbers expected under the assumption of a recessively acting mutation. We tested this on the progeny of ROMEL, the largest dataset available from one carrier. We analyzed the period from the beginning of the recording system for malformations to May 2007. In that period 44,170 calves were born that were sired by ROMEL. From these, 662 were considered as risk pairings, i.e. the mother had a risk of 0.5 to be a carrier (i.e. one of the grandparents was an obligate carrier) and 35 calves out of these were diagnosed as affected. Since it is expected that about 1/2 to 1/3 of the affected calves were recorded, this result is very close to the expected 1:7 ratio of affected to unaffected calves. Moreover, these findings are concordant with the historical description of the arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental [2] and the analyses of cases in Brown Swiss [5]. Finally, when applying linkage analyses using microsatellite markers, evaluations with a model assuming recessive autosomal inheritance gave the highest lod scores (Buitkamp et al., in preparation). Allelic frequency of carriers in the present Simmental cow population Since the arachnomelia syndrome-allele was passed to the current population through two parental lines (REXON and EGEL) and the main carriers are known, it is possible to estimate the frequency of the disease allele by an allele-counting method [10]. The allelic frequency was calculated for all cows from the breeding population who were alive in June 2007. In 10.4 percent of the pedigrees of 540,725 cows an identified carrier was found and the probability that individual cows were carrier of the arachnomelia syndrome-allele was calculated. E.g. in 14,740 and 41,032 cases a known carrier appeared as sire and grandsire, respectively. In these cases the probability of transmitting the allele is 50 and 25 percent, respectively, if no further carrier is present in the two generation pedigree. The averaged rate of the arachnomelia syndrome carriers based on known carriers over all cows alive in Bavarian Simmental was 3.32 percent. Using this approach, the frequency of carriers was calculated for each year (always based on the actual datasets from August 2008) from 2003 to 2008 (Figure 1). The calculations were done twice, considering all known carriers together, and also by using only ROMEL as a carrier to show the numeric contribution of his progeny (Figure 1). For these analyses, the sires that are designated to be non-carriers by the number of risk pairings without having a case or the indirect gene test are set as non-carrier. Therefore, these frequencies are slightly lower than the initial frequency estimate of 3.32 percent. Conclusion The cases of malformed Simmental calves presented here showed the same morphology described in the arachnomelia syndrome in Brown Swiss [e.g. [3]], even though there is a certain morphological variation from mild to severe malformations. The main findings, brachygnathia inferior and convex frontal bone of the face, deformation of vertebrae, and dysplasia of the limbs, namely the diaphyses of metatarsus and -carpus and the fetlocks, can best be explained by irregularly developed bone structure at the corresponding locations. Without pathological examination it is difficult to distinguish the arachnomelia syndrome from other malformations of the limbs. Therefore, low numbers of cases in Simmental probably passed unrecognized before 2005. In that year the allelic frequency of the disease in the cow population increased sharply because some sires that had been carriers of the mutation had become very popular 2-4 years before. The identification of a common ancestor, the results from the experimental matings and the analyses of numbers of cases from risk matings strongly support the hypothesis of an autosomal recessively inherited disease. Furthermore, this assumption is concordant with the historical description of the syndrome in Simmental and Brown Swiss. The allelic frequency of the arachnomelia syndrome in the current population is well above 3 percent and a substantial number of progeny from known carriers with superior genetic merit shall be used as sires during the next years. Therefore, a control system has to be established and the arachnomelia syndrome-gene should be mapped as a prerequisite for the development of an indirect gene test for carrier identification. The availability of pathologically well characterized cases from the field and from the ET-generated full-sib families will be an excellent material for a genetic mapping procedure. Methods Recording system for congenital malformations A system for monitoring inherited congenital malformations in Bavarian cattle populations was established by the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture (ITZ) in cooperation with the Bavarian milk recording organization (LKV) [11]. In short, a questionnaire was developed for detailed recording of malformed calves. The malformation was described according to its location (e.g. head, legs) and its characteristics (e.g. hernia). The standardized data were stored in a database at the LKV, that is evaluated monthly for a potential genetic background of malformations. Sires that fit into the pedigree (progeny of REXON or EGEL) with at least one affected calf with confirmed paternity were defined as obligate carriers and marked in the breeding information system [7]. In cases without connection to the pedigree and only one recorded calf the number of "risk pairings" (matings to cows where at least one parent is a known carrier, enabling the calculation of the probability for the occurrence of cases) was calculated. When the probability that a case occurs was above 99% for the sire in question the case was considered to be a phenocopy. The number of calves affected by the arachnomelia syndrome and their parentage is routinely published [8]. Pathological examinations Pathological examinations followed standard procedures. Calves were photographed and size and weight measurements were recorded. Tissue specimens from the condyle (epiphysis) and from the diaphysis of the femur were collected for histological examination. Specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and kept in a decalcifying solution (Ossafixonafor) for 24 hours. Thereafter, specimens were processed in an automated embedding system, sectioned at 4-6 microns and finally stained with haematoxyline and eosin. Experimental matings and embryo transfer Known carriers of the arachnomelia syndrome (seven cows that had produced at least one affected calf) were brought to the facilities of the ITZ for embryo transfer (Table 1). Late morulae and blastocysts collected on day 7 (day 0 = estrus) from superovulated donor cows were nonsurgically transferred to heifers [12]. Mode of inheritance and allele frequency The pedigree of all cases was constructed from the pedigree that is used for the joint breeding evaluation of Germany and Austria. The graphical presentation of the pedigree was performed with the Pedigraph TM software [13]. The allelic frequency of the AS mutation in the current cow population was estimated from ancestors with known genotypes following the allele-counting method [10]. For this reason two generation pedigrees of herd book cows in Bavarian Simmental were analyzed for obligate carriers. We considered all cows that were alive in June 2007 and included in the herd book. All animals were bred by the use of artificial insemination. Statistical analyses The non parametric Mann-Whitney-Test was performed using SPSS Version 14.0, the Chi-square test was performed using R 2.4.0 [14]. Authors' contributions JB drafted the manuscript and analyzed the pedigrees. BL conceived the monitoring system for inherited diseases. RE extracted the data from the database and estimated the allelic frequencies of the arachnomelia syndrome. HR and MW performed the embryo collection, transfer and recorded the morpho-metrical data of the experimental matings. BS examined the calves pathologically. NM and KG participated in study design and coordination and critically revised the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

2453154|t|A Novel Role of the NRF2 Transcription Factor in the Regulation of Arsenite-Mediated Keratin 16 Gene Expression in Human Keratinocytes
2453154|a|Abstract Background Inorganic sodium arsenite (iAs) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant and is associated with an increased risk of skin hyperkeratosis and cancer. Objectives We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the keratin 16 (K16) gene by iAs in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Methods We performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, luciferase assays, Western blots, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine the transcriptional regulation of the K16 gene by iAs. We used gene overexpression approaches to elucidate the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 related factor 2 (NRF2) involved in the K16 induction. Results iAs induced the mRNA and protein expression of K16. We also found that the expression of K16 was transcriptionally induced by iAs through activator protein-1-like sites and an antioxidant response element (ARE) in its gene promoter region. Treatment with iAs also enhanced the production and translocation of the NRF2 transcription factor, an ARE-binding protein, into the nucleus without modification of its mRNA expression. In addition, iAs elongated the half-life of the NRF2 protein. When overexpressed in HaCaT cells, NRF2 was also directly involved in not only the up-regulation of the detoxification gene thioredoxin but also K16 gene expression. Conclusions Our data clearly indicate that the K16 gene is a novel target of NRF2. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that NRF2 has opposing roles in the cell   in the activation of detoxification pathways and in promoting the development of skin disorders. Inorganic sodium arsenite (iAs), a ubiquitous element, is one of the most toxic metals present in the natural environment (Bagla and Kaiser 1996). Arsenicals are found as naturally occurring constituents of soil, food, and drinking water (Wu et al. 1989; Yoshida et al. 2004), and exposure to iAs has been associated with a variety of disease outcomes, including disorders of the skin, urinary bladder, liver, and lung (Tchounwou et al. 2004). In particular, skin hyperkeratosis is a characteristic dermatologic lesion associated with ingestion of arsenic from contaminated groundwater (McLellan 2002; Yoshida et al. 2004). There is also a significant association between hyperkeratosis, nonmelanoma skin cancer (e.g., basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), and Bowen disease (Col et al. 1999; Rossman et al. 2004). Furthermore, the pathologic features associated with arsenic-induced hyperkeratosis present as typical acanthotic types of psoriasis-like keratosis, characterized by the aberrant proliferation and terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes (Lee et al. 2006). Many epidemiologic studies have shown that hyperkeratoses are the most frequent precursor lesions of some skin cancers (Bagla and Kaiser 1996; Col et al. 1999). The keratins are the most prominent cytoskeletal proteins in keratinocytes and comprise a large family of proteins that form intermediate filament networks in all epithelial cell types (Moll et al. 1982). Keratin 16 (K16 ) and keratin 6 (K6) genes are constitutively expressed in a number of stratified epithelial levels, including the palmar and plantar epidermis (Moll et al. 1982). In skin diseases characterized by aberrant proliferation and differentiation, such as psoriasis and cancer, K16 is detectable at higher levels compared with normal tissue (Haider et al. 2006). Furthermore, the tissue-specific overexpression of wild-type K16 in the epidermis of transgenic mice results in the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and aberrant keratinization of cornified layers, leading to hyperkeratosis of the skin (Takahashi et al. 1994). Nuclear factor erythoid-derived 2 related factor 2 (NRF2), a    cap    n    collar    basic leucine zipper transcription factor, regulates a transcriptional program that maintains cellular redox homeostasis and protects cells from oxidative stress and xenobiotic agents (Ishii et al. 2000; Moi et al. 1994). Several detoxifying and antioxidant genes, including glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), and thioredoxin (TXN), are regulated by NRF2 through the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) in the respective promoter regions of these genes (McMahon et al. 2001; Wakabayashi et al. 2004). NRF2 is held in the cytoplasm by a cytoskeletal-associated specific inhibitory protein (kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; KEAP1) under normal cellular redox state conditions, where it is continuously targeted by the proteasomal degradation pathway (McMahon et al. 2003). Upon exposure of the cell to oxidative stress or electrophiles, NRF2 can escape this KEAP1-mediated repression, translocate to the nucleus, and activate the expression of its target genes (Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2002; McMahon et al. 2003). Recently, studies of Keap1-/-mice have shown that NRF2 accumulates in the nucleus and constitutively activates the transcription of its target genes, even in the absence of stress signals (Wakabayashi et al. 2003). Most interestingly, however, the skin, esophagus, and forestomach of Keap1-deficient mice show cornified layer and hyperkeratosis phenotypes. In addition, previous studies have also shown that the expression of NRF2 and ARE-controlled genes is induced by iAs in some cell types (Pi et al. 2003; Sakurai et al. 2005). Furthermore, histochemical analyses have indicated that the expression of K16 is increased in Bowen disease, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma induced by arsenicals (Yu et al. 1993). However, it remains to be determined whether NRF2 can regulate the transcriptional activation of K16 upon iAs exposure in human keratinocytes. Hence, these findings prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the K16 gene by iAs-induced NRF2 mediation. Materials and Methods Chemicals and reagents A purified preparation of inorganic sodium arsenite (iAs; NaAsO2; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and added directly to the culture medium. A fresh iAs solution was prepared for each new experiment. Cycloheximide (CHX), dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO), and a protease inhibitor cocktail were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). CHX was dissolved in DMSO and stored -20oC until use. Cells and culture conditions The human keratinocyte HaCaT cell line was obtained from N.E. Fusenig (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were maintained in monolayer cultures in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37oC in Dulbecco   s modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 mg/mL streptomycin and nonessential amino acids (Gibco BRL, Paisley, UK). RNA preparation and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis We determined RNA expression levels by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis as described previously (Sugioka et al. 2004). Total RNA was isolated from HaCaT cells using the GeneElute Mammalian Total RNA Kit (Sigma). The specific primers used for first-strand cDNA synthesis and PCR were as follows: K16 [forward, 5   -GAT GCT TGC TCT GAG AGG TC-3   , and reverse, 5   -CCA GCA AGA TCT GGT ACT CC-3   ; Gene Bank accession no. NM_005557 (National Center for Biotechnology Information 2007)]; c-Jun (forward, 5   -CCT GTT GCG GCC CCG AAA CT-3   , and reverse, 5   -ACC ATG CCT GCC CCG TTG AC-3   ; NM_002228); c-Fos (forward, 5   -TTT GCC TAA CCG CCA CGA TGA T-3   , and reverse, 5   -TTG CCG CTT TCT GCC ACC TC-3   ; NM_005252); NRF2 (forward, 5   -AGA TTC ACA GGC CTT TCT CG-3   , and reverse, 5   -CAG CTC TCC CTA CCG TTG GA-3   ; AF323119); KEAP1 (forward, 5   -CAG AGG TGG TGG TGT TGC TTA T-3   , and reverse, 5   -AGC TCG TTC ATG ATG CCA AAG-3   ; NM_012289); TXN (forward, 5   -CAG GGG AAT GAA AGA AAG G-3   , and reverse, 5   -CAA GGT GAA GCA GAT CG-3   ; NM_003329), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a loading control (forward, 5   -ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3   , and reverse, 5   -TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3   , NM_002046). PCR products were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Western blot analysis We performed Western blot analysis as described previously (Sugioka et al. 2004). Briefly, nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer   s protocol. For protein extraction, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail. We measured protein concentrations using the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA). Equal amounts of protein were then resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK). Immunoblotting was carried out with specific antibodies in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. The primary antibodies were as follows: K16 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA), NRF2 and KEAP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), c-Jun (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), and b-actin (Sigma). After washing, the membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed by chemiluminescence using the ECL Plus Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids, transfections, and luciferase assays Human K16 promoter regions of varying lengths (pXK-1, 3, 4, 5-1, and 5-2) were provided by Y-N Wang (National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan). These DNA fragments were prepared from HaCaT cells and were ligated into the pXP-1 luciferase vector (Wang and Chang 2003). The p3xARE/Luc vector, harboring three tandem repeats of ARE, was donated by X.L. Chen (Discovery Research, AtheroGenics Inc., Alpharetta, GA, USA) (Chen et al. 2003). The wild-type NRF2 expression vector (WT-NRF2) was a gift from H.S. So (Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Korea) (So et al. 2006). NRF2 cDNA was subcloned into a pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). For the transfection of reporter plasmids, we seeded HaCaT cells into six-well plates at a density of 80% the previous day. Cells were then transfected with a total of each luciferase reporter construct (2.5 ug) using LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen). To control for the efficiency of transfection, Renilla luciferase gene expression was monitored using either the pRL-CMV or pRL-TK vectors (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For overexpression of WT-NRF2, we normalized the total plasmid concentration using the pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing either vehicle (PBS) or iAs for 6 hr. After iAs exposure, we harvested cells and analyzed them for luciferase activity using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). For the investigation of the role of NRF2 in regulating K16 gene expression, transfection of an NRF2 expression plasmid into HaCaT cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in 100-mm plates 24 hr before transfection. The expression plasmid WT-NRF2 (15 ug) was then transfected into the cells for 48-60 hr. As a negative control, we used 15 ug of the pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSA) We extracted and measured nuclear proteins as described above. Nuclear protein/ DNA complexes were subjected to electrophoresis in nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 2% glycerol in 0.25% Tris-borate/EDTA buffer and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon transfer membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for detection using the Light-Shift EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer   s protocol, with minor modifications. We incubated 10-ug aliquots of nuclear extract with the DNA probe in a binding reaction buffer containing 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NP-40 detergent, and 2 ug of poly(dI-dC).poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature. For supershift assays, 2 ug of either a polyclonal anti-NRF2 or an anti-c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added with the nuclear protein for 2 hr at 4oC before the labeled oligonucleotide probe was added. Biotin-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides WT-K16ARE (-157/-132, 5   -GGGGAACCTGGAGTCAGCAGT-TAGGA-3   ), containing an ARE site (-148/ -140, underlined) in the human K16 promoter region, and Mut-K16ARE (5   -GGGGAA-CCTGGAGTCAaaAGTTAGGA-3   , mutated GC box in the ARE) were prepared by Fasmac (Kanagawa, Japan). A consensus ARE probe was purchased from Panomics, Inc. (Redwood City, CA, USA). For competition binding of the K16 ARE-complexes, we used an unlabeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide (5   -TATC-GATAAGCTATGAGTCATCCGGG-3   ). The binding specificity was confirmed in each case by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. CHX chase experiment We investigated the posttranscriptional regulation of both the steady-state levels and half-life of the NRF2 protein by CHX chase analysis. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium in the absence or presence of iAs for 6 hr. The culture medium was then replaced with serum-free medium containing CHX (100 ug/mL). We prepared cell lysates at 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after iAs treatment. Whole-cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against NRF2. Statistics All the data generated from at least three independent experiments and expressed as the mean + SD were analyzed by the Student   s t-test. Statistical comparisons were made by logarithmic transformation of the normalized values. We considered p-values < 0.01 to be statistically significant. Results K16 expression is induced by iAs in HaCaT cells We wanted to determine whether the K16 mRNA is transcriptionally regulated by iAs, and treated HaCaT cells with this compound for various time periods over a range of doses. After treatment of HaCaT cells with 1-20 uM iAs, the expression of K16 mRNA was increased compared with the control at 6 hr (Figure 1A) but had declined to basal levels at 24 hr. The increase in the K16 protein levels after 6 hr of iAs exposure was just detectable at 10-20 uM, but a dose-dependent increase was more evident at 10 hr (Figure 1B). This enhancement of K16 expression had declined to basal levels at 24 hr. Identification of the iAs responsive region in the K16 gene promoter To investigate the mechanisms underlying the transactivation of the K16 gene by iAs, we first examined the response of the K16 regulatory region to this compound using a luciferase reporter gene assay. The dose-dependent activation of K16 transcription after iAs treatment was observed with a construct containing a 515-bp fragment of the K16 promoter (Figure 2A). To further elucidate the region containing the iAs responsive element, we examined a series of deletions of the 5   -flanking region of K16 gene. The ARE sequence in the pXK-5-1 vector contains an activator protein-1 (AP-1)-like element followed by a GC box. As shown in Figure 2B, an enhancement in the reporter activity levels was observed for the promoter constructs, pXK-1, 3, 4, and 5-1, in response to 20 uM iAs. A decline in reporter activity, however, depended on the number of AP-1-like sites, and the results for the pXK-5-1 construct show also that ARE is activated by iAs. In contrast, no significant activation was observed using a pXK-5-2 construct in response to 20 uM iAs. Expression of AP-1 transcriptions factor and c-Jun production following iAs treatment We examined AP-1 transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos expression in iAs-treated HaCaT cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR. iAs-induced c-Jun expression was observed during the first 3 hr after treatment (data not shown). An appreciable induction of c-Jun was also confirmed after 6 hr, but this was down-regulated by 24 hr after iAs treatment (Figure 3A). In contrast, the expression of c-Fos was only transiently detectable at 3 hr (data not shown) but was not observed during the 6-24 hr period of this experiment. As shown in Figure 3B, iAs-enhanced c-Jun production can be observed in a dose-dependent manner at 6 hr, but it declines from 10 to 24 hr. iAs potently induces the translocation of NRF2 and activates the ARE of the K16 promoter The results of our reporter assays suggested that iAs stimulates not only the AP-1-like sites but also the ARE site within the K16 gene promoter in HaCaT cells (Figure 3). In addition, several oxidative stress agents and toxic chemicals, including iAs, have been reported to induce the expression of ARE-dependent genes in several cell types (Pi et al. 2003; Sakurai et al. 2005). On the basis of our observations and some recent reports, we thus hypothesized that iAs would have the ability to activate the ARE of the K16 gene promoter directly, resulting in the induction of K16 expression in HaCaT cells. To confirm that the K16 ARE indeed functions as an iAs-responsive transcriptional control element, we performed transient transfections of HaCaT cells with a p3xARE/Luc construct and then subjected these cells to iAs for 6 hr. As shown in Figure 4A, treatment of HaCaT cells with iAs results in a dramatic increase in ARE-driven promoter activity. Likewise, EMSA using a consensus ARE probe show that iAs-induced ARE-binding complexes increase markedly, in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 4B). These results indicate that iAs has the ability to activate the ARE-driven genes. We performed further EMSA experiments using an ARE probe specific to the K16 proximal promoter region (WT-K16ARE) and found that K16ARE-nuclear protein complexes formation is augmented by iAs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Moreover, the formation of these complexes is specifically inhibited by the addition of excess unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor (Figure 4B,C), whereas an excess of an unlabeled AP-1 probe competes only marginally for K16ARE binding (Figure 4C). The NRF2 transcription factor has been shown to bind to AREs upon translocation into the nucleus, resulting in the induction of ARE-mediated genes (Wakabayashi et al. 2004). To examine whether iAs induces and translocates NRF2 into the nucleus in HaCaT cells, we treated these cells with iAs for either 3 or 6 hr. As shown in Figure 4D, a dose-dependent accumulation of NRF2 protein was observed in the nucleus upon treatment with iAs for 6 hr. This was not observed in the parallel experiment performed over the 3-hr time course. Supershift EMSA analysis using an NRF2 antibody showed that the iAs-induced and iAs-translocated NRF2 protein binds to the WT-K16ARE probe containing the ARE sequence of the K16 proximal promoter region (5   -GGAGTCAGC-3   ) that comprises an AP-1-like site and a GC box, whereas the supershift of c-Jun was not observed (Figure 4E). To identify whether the GC box is dispensable for the iAs-stimulated binding activity of NRF2, we next performed EMSA analyses with either WT- or a Mut-K16ARE probe containing an intact AP-1-like element but a mutated GC box. As shown in Figure 4F, the K16ARE-nuclear protein complexes and supershifted bands that were enhanced by iAs treatment were largely abolished by the addition of the Mut-K16ARE probe. iAs stabilizes the NRF2 protein We examined the effects of iAs treatment on the function of KEAP1 in HaCaT cells. Treatment with iAs did not alter the expression levels of KEAP1 mRNA or protein over either a 3 or 6 hr time course (Figure 5A). Next, we examined the effects of iAs on the expression of NRF2 mRNA in HaCaT cells. Exposure to iAs did not significantly alter the steady-state levels of NRF2 mRNA (data not shown). Production of NRF2 protein, however, was observed to increase in both a dose-and time-dependent manner (Figure 4D). To further examine the stabilization of NRF2 protein by iAs, we monitored the decay of basal and iAs-induced NRF2 proteins after inhibition of protein synthesis by CHX (Figure 5B). The results of this analysis revealed that the NRF2 protein levels decrease by approximately 50% within 30 min of treatment with CHX in cells that had not been exposed to iAs. Only trace amounts of NRF2 are then detectable after 60 min of exposure to CHX in these cells. The HaCaT cells were then pretreated with iAs for 6 hr before their exposure to CHX in a similar timecourse experiment. The levels of NRF2 in these iAs-treated cells were again found to decrease by about 50%, but only after 120 min of CHX exposure. NRF2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of K16 gene expression in HaCaT cells To confirm the functional role of NRF2 in the induction of K16 gene expression by iAs, we investigated whether the expression of K16 mRNA is induced by the overexpression of NRF2 (WT-NRF2) in HaCaT cells. We also investigated the expression of the detoxification gene TXN, which is highly induced by a variety of oxidative stimuli through NRF2-mediated ARE transactivation (Kim et al. 2001). The expression of TXN gene in untransfected cells after treatment with iAs was stronger than that of the control cells (Figure 6A). When the cells were transfected with WT-NRF2 and then treated with or without iAs, the expression of TXN mRNA was augmented markedly compared with the empty-vector control. Similarly, the expression of K16 mRNA was also induced in cells transfected with WT-NRF2 in the absence or presence of iAs. We next performed a transient transfection of HaCaT cells with the pXK-5-1 luciferase vector together with the WT-NRF2 vector. The overexpression of NRF2 in increasing concentrations resulted in significant enhancement of the ARE-mediated K16 promoter activation (Figure 6B). Discussion In the present study, we showed for the first time that iAs induces the transcriptional activation of K16 in the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, through the ARE present in its gene promoter. It has been reported previously that treatment with iAs enhances the production and translocation of NRF2 into the nucleus in several cell types. However, until now it has remained uncertain whether the induction of NRF2 by iAs mediates the transcriptional activation of the K16 gene in keratinocytes. In our current experiments, we demonstrated that iAs elongates the half-life of the NRF2 protein, which results in its increased expression levels. Furthermore, this iAs-induced NRF2 protein was shown to bind to the ARE sequences in the promoter region of the K16 gene. Finally, by overexpressing NRF2, we have clarified that its induction is involved in not only the gene expression of the detoxification gene TXN, but also in the upregulation of K16 expression in HaCaT cells through the ARE in the K16 gene promoter. These experiments indicate an important and novel function for NRF2 in the regulation of K16 in keratinocytes and also help to further explain the molecular mechanisms underlying arsenic-mediated epidermal hyperkeratosis. In our present experiments, the expression levels of K16 mRNA and protein were indeed found to be enhanced by iAs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1). In addition, luciferase assays of the K16 promoter revealed that iAs enhances its activity in a dose-dependent fashion, which is stimulated by AP-1-like sites and an ARE (Figure 2). The promoter of the human K16 gene was recently cloned and sequenced, and several AP-1-like sites were found within the -515-bp region of the gene (Wang and Chang 2003). AP-1 transcription factor can be formed by the dimerization of either Jun or Jun/Fos family members (Eferl and Wagner 2003). In the present study, the increased expression of c-Jun, but not c-Fos was evident in the nuclei of HaCaT cells after iAs treatment (Figure 3). Our findings thus suggest that the activation of c-Jun/AP-1 is one of the essential steps in the regulation of K16 gene expression by iAs exposure in HaCaT cells. It has been well documented that the ARE core sequence includes an AP-1-like binding site (TGAC/GTCA), followed by a GC box (Rushmore et al. 1991; Xie et al. 1995). We have found in our current analyses that the AP-1-like site within the K16 promoter region from -148 to -140 bp (5   -GGAGTCAGC-3   ) resembles a consensus ARE sequence. Recent studies have shown that AREs can be specifically bound by complexes of several basic-leucine zipper transcription factors, including NRF2 (Ishii et al. 2000; Moi et al. 1994). NRF2 heterodimerizes with either AP-1 or small MAF (MAFG, MAFK, and MAFF) proteins (MAF, v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog) and binds to the ARE to induce the transcription of ARE-mediated genes (Motohashi et al. 2002). In the present investigation, EMSA and supershift assays showed that the NRF2 proteins in the nuclei bind to the ARE sequences of K16 promoter region after iAs exposure. iAs-induced c-Jun, however, does not bind to this ARE (Figure 4E). c-Jun may thus act on other AP-1 sites within the K16 promoter region. These results also suggest that other heterodimer partners of NRF2 are involved in the ARE regulation of K16 promoter region underlying iAs-mediated the K16 gene expression. Gel shifts with an K16Mut-ARE probe (harboring a mutation in the ARE GC box) clearly show that the ARE sequence in the K16 promoter, particularly the terminal GC dinucleotide, is essential for mediating iAs-induced K16 transactivation and NRF2 binding (Figure 4F). Several investigations have suggested that the GC nucleotides within the ARE are essential for both the basal and oxidative stress-induced activities of the ARE-related genes, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) (Wasserman and Fahl 1997; Wild et al. 1998). Our current results are consistent with these earlier studies in showing that the formation of the iAs-responsive NRF2/ARE complexes is reduced by a mutation in the GC box. Collectively, our present observations reveal a new molecular mechanism in which iAs-induced K16 gene expression is also regulated by activation NRF2/ARE pathways. It has been widely accepted that oxidative stress disrupts sequestration of NRF2 by KEAP1, permits NRF2 translocation to the nucleus, and transactivates the expression of various NRF2-mediated genes (Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2002; McMahon et al. 2003). Our present study showed that iAs elongates the half-life of the NRF2 protein but has no effects upon KEAP1 expression (Figure 5). Other studies have also demonstrated that the production of NRF2 is increased by various inducers via posttranscriptional control (Nguyen et al. 2003; Stewart et al. 2003). Several earlier reports also indicated that either oxidative stress or antioxidant substances stabilize the expression of the NRF2 protein, either by directly modifying the cysteine residues on KEAP1 to disrupt the NRF2/KEAP1 complex (Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2002) or by facilitating the release of NRF2 through the phosphorylation of the NRF2/KEAP1 complex (Bloom and Jaiswal 2003). These findings are largely consistent with our present finding that iAs stabilizes the expression of NRF2 in HaCaT cells by elongating the protein half-life. Recently, Wakabayashi et al. (2003) demonstrated that NRF2 accumulates in the nucleus at constitutively high levels and produces various cytoprotective genes in embryonic fibroblast- and liver-derived Keap1-null mice. Surprisingly, these Keap1-deficient mice also show a thicker stratum corneum epidermis, abnormal keratinization, and cornification in the esophagus and forestomach (hyperkeratosis). K6 was found to be strongly expressed in the esophageal epithelium of these mice. These results indicate that K6 is also a target gene of NRF2. In addition, the promoter of the K6 gene bears a remarkable sequence similarity to the K16 promoter (Jiang et al. 1993). Therefore, we examined whether K16 gene expression is also regulated by NRF2. In the present study, the gene expression and transactivation of K16 were dramatically induced by transfection with WT-NRF2 via in HaCaT cells, clearly demonstrating that NRF2 acts as a direct transcriptional regulator of the K16 gene (Figure 6). In addition, we also showed that transfection of HaCaT cells with WT-NRF2 induces the expression of detoxification gene TXN (Figure 6A). NRF2 may thus have a major role to play in the development of hyperkeratosis, whereas the expression and induction of NRF2 is implicated in cell protection against a variety of genotoxic and cytotoxic effects. Hence, based on these results and on the findings from studies of Keap1 knockout mice, iAs may both cause hyperkeratosis and induce detoxification enzymes via the modification of NRF2. Given that there are both beneficial and adverse effects of NRF2 activity, caution will therefore be needed when using antioxidants for prevention and therapy. Although further investigations are needed, we believe that our findings provide important clues for the design of future therapies for arsenic-mediated hyperkeratosis and for treatments involving the molecular targeting of NRF2. Conclusion Our findings clearly demonstrate that the induction of the K16 gene in human keratinocytes by iAs depends on NRF2 activation. Our results thus represent a valuable initial effort to elucidate the relationship between the K16 gene and the NRF2 transcription factor, which may be responsible for hyperkeratosis.

The synthesis and characterization of four di- and tri-n-butyltin cysteaminates and_ N,N-dimethylcysteaminates and three protonated / quaternized derivatives are reported. They all exhibit moderate or high in vitro cytotoxic activity. Six of seven compounds presented in this work are more active than cisplatin, etoposide and 5-fluorouracil, but less active than methotrexate and doxorubiein. Introduction. Several organotin cysteaminates (aminoethylthiolates) have been studied 1-4 as compounds with potentially high biological activity, but little is known about their cytotoxic effect. The present paper reports the synthesis and characterization of di- and tri-n-butyltin cysteaminates and their N,N-dimethyl analogues and their in vitro cytotoxicity. It is shown that a correct evaluation of the biological activity of organotin compounds remains 5 often hampered by their low water solubility. Therefore, we focused on the synthesis of derivatives with potentially higher water solubility by introducing ionic groups into the molecule by protonation or quatemization of a nitrogen atom.

The values of the 6(SN)chemical shifts of compounds 1, 2 and 4 only slightly differ from the (15N) values of the free cysteamine. The significantly larger i(15N) chemical shift of compound 3 is however much lower than those of compounds 5, 6 and 7 containing a N interaction in compounds 1 tetracoordinated nitrogen atom. It can be stated that the Sn 4 is negligible or only very weak in chlorofom solutions. This conclusion is not in contradiction with the proved Sn N interaction found in the solid state 8. 13 . , 234  Metal Based Drugs Vol. 7, Nr. 5, 2000 Antitumour activity.

2526157|t|Identification and Analysis of Co-Occurrence Networks with NetCutter
2526157|a|Abstract Background Co-occurrence analysis is a technique often applied in text mining, comparative genomics, and promoter analysis. The methodologies and statistical models used to evaluate the significance of association between co-occurring entities are quite diverse, however. Methodology/Principal Findings We present a general framework for co-occurrence analysis based on a bipartite graph representation of the data, a novel co-occurrence statistic, and software performing co-occurrence analysis as well as generation and analysis of co-occurrence networks. We show that the overall stringency of co-occurrence analysis depends critically on the choice of the null-model used to evaluate the significance of co-occurrence and find that random sampling from a complete permutation set of the bipartite graph permits co-occurrence analysis with optimal stringency. We show that the Poisson-binomial distribution is the most natural co-occurrence probability distribution when vertex degrees of the bipartite graph are variable, which is usually the case. Calculation of Poisson-binomial P-values is difficult, however. Therefore, we propose a fast bi-binomial approximation for calculation of P-values and show that this statistic is superior to other measures of association such as the Jaccard coefficient and the uncertainty coefficient. Furthermore, co-occurrence analysis of more than two entities can be performed using the same statistical model, which leads to increased signal-to-noise ratios, robustness towards noise, and the identification of implicit relationships between co-occurring entities. Using NetCutter, we identify a novel protein biosynthesis related set of genes that are frequently coordinately deregulated in human cancer related gene expression studies. NetCutter is available at http://bio.ifom-ieo-campus.it/NetCutter/). Conclusion Our approach can be applied to any set of categorical data where co-occurrence analysis might reveal functional relationships such as clinical parameters associated with cancer subtypes or SNPs associated with disease phenotypes. The stringency of our approach is expected to offer an advantage in a variety of applications. Introduction Biological research has experienced a paradigm shift in the last decade catalyzed by the availability of genome sequences and the resulting development of high-throughput technologies. The large data volumes produced by these novel technologies are often published as supplementary material and/or stored in extensive data repositories [1]. Functional interpretation of these data is an ongoing challenge. Co-occurrence analysis, based on the hypothesis that co-occurring entities are functionally linked, is a technique that has been used in three main areas of biological research: Co-occurrence of genes in sequenced genomes relies on the fact that proteins do not function in isolation and are dependent on other proteins, either as direct binding partners, or as catalysts of substrates. Thus, when two proteins significantly co-occur in a large number of genomes or can be observed as fusion proteins in a subset of genomes, they are likely to be binding partners or enzymes needed for a specific metabolic pathway. Examples of those studies have been reported by [2]-[7]. Text mining is a quickly evolving field that aims at developing technologies helping to cope with the functional interpretation of large volumes of publications. Co-occurrence of gene names in publication abstracts, entire publications, or other gene-related databases has been used to derive co-occurrence networks with clear evidence that edges in those networks are reflecting functionally relevant relationships [8]-[11]. Gene names have also been analyzed for co-occurrence with other entities such as mutations [12], chemical compounds [13], and disease related keywords [14]. From the resulting networks, hypotheses about candidate genes involved in inherited diseases and drug targets can be derived. Clustering of gene related publications using keywords has been applied to enhance the quality of gene expression clusters [15], [16]. More general (non gene-centric) approaches try to organize the literature into functional areas based on co-occurrence of MeSH terms, keywords, diseases, phenotypes, chemicals, and similar objects of biomedical research interest [17]-[21]. Co-occurrence analysis of transcription factor binding motifs has been carried out in a variety of slightly differing ways in a wide range of organisms, including humans. [22]-[33]. The underlying hypothesis is that co-regulated genes, identified usually by gene expression studies, should contain specific combinations of transcription factor binding motifs in their upstream regulatory regions, the identification of which would allow the reverse-engineering of transcription regulatory networks [34]. We have recently applied co-occurrence analysis to studying published gene expression signatures and showed that co-occurrence patterns of genes reflect cancer signaling pathways [35]. Although co-occurrence analysis has a respectable history, the methodologies used in the studies mentioned above could not be easily applied to studying gene expression signatures. There are three main reasons that dictated the use of a different approach. First, gene expression signatures can vary in size by orders of magnitude. Obviously, the larger a signature the more likely it is to find two or more genes co-occurring in that signature. Thus, the significance of co-occurrences must be evaluated in the presence of considerable heterogeneity of co-occurrence probabilities among gene lists. As a consequence, the statistics used to evaluate the significance of co-occurrence events must reflect this heterogeneity. In particular, it must be based on list-specific co-occurrence probabilities. Second, in the vast majority of previous studies, co-occurrence is analyzed for pair-wise combinations of co-occurring entities. We found that the resulting stringency of this approach is not adequate for the analysis of published gene expression signatures [35]. Third, the null-model against which the significance of co-occurrences is tested does not work well for gene expression signatures. A common procedure is to use generic randomization of the entire data set under analysis or to select subsets of data entries randomly for comparison purposes. However, gene expression signatures are composed of distinct gene sets and the null-model must maintain this property, which is not guaranteed using these approaches. Furthermore, the list-specific nature of co-occurrence probabilities cannot be dealt with properly. NetCutter was developed to address these challenges and to provide a generic tool for generating and analyzing co-occurrence networks. Although NetCutter has been developed for the analysis of gene expression signatures, it is based on abstract concepts that make it applicable to a wide variety of problems. The input is represented by a bipartite graph that is composed of list-entry pairs, which are stored in tab-separated text format. Co-occurrence of entries in lists is analyzed using pair-wise or higher order combinations of entries. The significance of co-occurrence is tested using a novel bi-binomial approximation of Poisson-binomial statistics (which is a binomial distribution with trial specific probabilities) that handles list-length-heterogeneity properly and provides a novel measure of association that is found to be superior to the Jaccard and the uncertainty coefficients. Occurrence probabilities are obtained from an edge-swapping procedure that maintains vertex degrees in the underlying bipartite graph and distinct sets of entries per list. As we shall see below, this procedure has a number of advantages over other possible null-models and permits co-occurrence analysis with near maximum stringency. Last but not least, NetCutter is equipped with a number of algorithms for the identification of network communities, vertex ranking, and convenience tools needed in the analysis of co-occurrence networks, or any undirected graph. We illustrate the utility of NetCutter in the identification of corresponding clusters of genes and publications from the PubLiME data set. PubLiME (Published Lists of Microarray Experiments) is a repository of published cancer related gene expression signatures (http://bio.ifom-ieo-campus.it/Publime). The concept of cluster correspondence follows from the bipartite graph representation of the data. Reversing the list-entry order in the bipartite graph permits identifying communities of entries as well as communities of lists. We show that communities of publications corresponding to communities of genes in the PubLiME data set can be used to generate hypotheses about the putative function of gene communities. Results The bipartite graph model of co-occurrence analysis Co-occurrence analysis using NetCutter is based on the abstraction of list-entry pairs. Any entity that co-occurs with some other entity must be confined to some sort of container where co-occurrence is observed. For example, in the case of gene name co-occurrence in PubMed abstracts, the abstract is the container and the gene names are the co-occurring entities. Similarly, co-occurrence of transcription factor binding motifs is observed in gene promoters. The promoters are the containers where motif entities co-occur. The containers generally host more than one entity (otherwise co-occurrence would be impossible) and can be conveniently interpreted as lists. The co-occurring entities are the list entries. Lists and entries form a bipartite graph with one part of the graph representing lists and the other part representing entries. The presence of a given entry in a given list is indicated by an edge between the corresponding list and entry vertices. It is required that each entry can be linked to the same list only once. Without loss of generality, let's consider genes as entries and PubMedID_listIDs as lists in the following, unless otherwise specified (Fig. 1A). This interpretation of lists and entries has been applied in the co-occurrence analysis of published gene expression signatures [35]. Occurrence probabilities and null-models A prerequisite for co-occurrence analysis is the availability of occurrence probabilities of genes per list. The occurrence probabilities can be derived from randomizing the bipartite graph and are dependent on the choice of the null-model. A null-model creates an occurrence probability matrix where the occurrence probability for each list-gene pair is listed. As a general property of this matrix, the sum of all matrix elements must equal the number of edges in the bipartite graph. This is because each edge is linked to either side of the bipartite graph with certainty and therefore the sum of occurrence probabilities over all lists (which can be calculated as the row sum if genes are listed vertically or as the column sum if genes are listed horizontally) followed by summing the results over all genes must be 1 for every edge. The number of matrix elements is given by #genes*#lists and therefore the average occurrence probability for any null-model must be #edges/(#genes*#lists). As a consequence, different null-models will only be distinguished by the way they attribute occurrence probabilities to vertices with different vertex degrees but not by the average occurrence probability. We consider six different strategies to randomize the bipartite graph. First, we could reconnect all edges of the graph randomly. The probability of being connected by an edge for a given list-gene pair is given by (1/#genes)*(1/#lists). Since there are #edges edges to be reconnected, the occurrence probability for a single list-gene pair is #edges/(#genes*#lists), i.e. equal to the average occurrence probability. Thus, this model provides equal occurrence probabilities for all gene-list pairs and does not consider vertex degrees. We call this model the generic randomization (GR) model in the following. Second, we could disconnect the edges on only the list side of the bipartite graph and reconnect them randomly. The occurrence probability of a gene vertex would be given by (gene vertex degree)/#lists. The sum of these probabilities over all lists is equal to the gene vertex degree and the sum of all gene vertex degrees is equal to the total number of edges. Thus, the sum of all matrix elements is equal to the number of edges, as required. Since this model considers gene vertex degrees, we call it the gene vertex degree (GVD) model. Third, we disconnect the edges on the gene side of the bipartite graph and reconnect them randomly. The probability of a list vertex being connected to a gene would be given by (list vertex degree)/#genes. The sum of these probabilities over all genes is equal to the list vertex degree and the sum of all list vertex degrees is equal to the total number of edges. Again, the sum of all matrix elements is equal to the total number of edges. Since this model considers list vertex degrees, we call it the list vertex degree (LVD) model. In model four and five, we reconnect edges considering both gene and list vertex degrees and allow multiple edges between list-gene pairs. The occurrence probabilities in model four are calculated according to the binomial distribution. We calculate the probability of a list-gene pair for being connected as the cumulative binomial probability of the list-gene pair being chosen at least once in the process of randomly reconnecting the edges. This can be achieved by setting the number of trials equal to the gene vertex degree, the probability of success equal to the list vertex degree divided by the total number of edges, and the number of successes equal to 0. The occurrence probability of a list-gene pair is then given by the complement of this probability. This model is called the binomial (BN) model. In model five, we calculate occurrence probabilities according to the hypergeometric distribution. The number of successes in the sample is equal to 0, the sample size is equal to the gene vertex degree, the number of successes in the population is set to the list vertex degree, and the population size is the total number of edges. Again, the occurrence probability of a list-gene pair is obtained as the complement of this probability. We call this model the hypergeometric (HG) model. Calculating occurrence probabilities in this manner does not guarantee that the matrix elements add up to the total number of edges. Therefore, the matrices are normalized such that this condition is satisfied by multiplying each matrix element with the factor #edges/(observed matrix sum), which is generally quite close to 1, however. In model six, we again consider vertex degrees, but we require that each list is composed of distinct sets of genes. Thus, multiple edges are forbidden. This condition is satisfied by applying an edge-swapping procedure during graph randomization. Edge-swapping works by randomly choosing two list-gene pairs from the bipartite graph and prior to performing the edge-swap, a test is performed to ensure that the two genes are not already linked to the respective target lists. This procedure is performed a large number of times. To ensure complete randomization of the graph, the number of swaps performed should be significantly larger than the number of edges. After performing R randomizations of the graph and counting the number of times a gene has been linked to a particular list, division of this number by R gives the occurrence probability of a gene in a given list. As will be shown below, edge-swapping produces occurrence probabilities that closely approximate occurrence probabilities obtained by generating a complete permutation set of the bipartite graph, counting the number of times a gene is found part of a list, and dividing this number by the total number of permutations. In the permutation model, the sum of occurrence probabilities of a gene over all lists equals the gene vertex degree (see below) and thus the sum of all matrix elements is the number of edges. Since permutation sets of bipartite graphs are difficult to calculate, we use the edge-swapping procedure as a close approximation and call this model the edge-swapping (ES) model. Fig. 1 shows the occurrence probabilities of the different null-models for the bipartite graph shown in Fig. 1A. The GR model yields identical occurrence probabilities for all list-gene pairs, which is equal to the average occurrence probability in all models. In the other models, the occurrence probabilities deviate to varying extent from the average occurrence probability as a function of vertex degrees. In the GVD model, the deviations are a function of gene vertex degree and in the LVD model the deviations are dependent on list vertex degrees. In the remaining models, the deviations are functions of both the gene and the list vertex degrees. In all cases, larger than average occurrence probabilities are obtained for larger vertex degrees at the expense of smaller than average occurrence probabilities for smaller vertex degrees. From these data, it is difficult to choose the most effective null-model. A hint can be gleaned from gene1, however. Gene1 is present in all lists. Therefore, the co-occurrence probability of gene1 with other genes, which is calculated by multiplying the occurrence probabilities of gene1 and geneX for every list under study, should depend only on the occurrence probability of this other gene. In other words, the occurrence probability of gene1 in all lists should be 1.0. Only two models satisfy this constraint: The GVD and the ES models. Since the GVD model does not consider list vertex degrees, it seems that the ES model is the preferred null-model. Expected number of co-occurrences As a general criterion for comparing the effectiveness of different null-models, we have to compare them for the number of expected co-occurrences. The most effective null-model will be the one that maximizes the expected number of co-occurrences. If the expected number of co-occurrences is larger, an observed number of co-occurrences in a real bipartite graph will be less significant and thus such a null-model permits co-occurrence analysis with higher stringency. The expected number of co-occurrences depends in an obvious fashion on the list vertex degree. If pair-wise co-occurrences are considered, the number of co-occurrences in a list of vertex degree N is given by the binomial coefficient N over 2. Larger lists will give rise to more co-occurrences and the number increases quickly with list vertex degree. The dependency of the expected number of co-occurrences on the gene vertex degree is less obvious and depends strongly on the null-model. A gene that is part of a list with vertex degree N will give rise to N-1 co-occurrences in that list. The null-model permits calculating the probability to find this gene in a given list. Thus, the expected number of co-occurrences of a gene is given by the sum of expected co-occurrences in all lists where for a single list the expected co-occurrences are given by (Nl   1)*pl. Nl is the list vertex degree and pl is the occurrence probability of the gene in that list as determined by the null-model. We used the PubLiME data set [35] to calculate the expected number of co-occurrences with different null-models. The results are shown in Fig 2A. The expected number of co-occurrences was calculated for all genes in all lists using all null-models and the sum of expected co-occurrences per gene is shown as a scatter plot with the gene vertex degree on the x-axis and the expected number of co-occurrences on the y-axis. The results in Fig. 2A suggest the following ranking of null-models: GR<GVD<LVD<BN = HG<ES. The BN and the HG models perform in an essentially identical way. However, the ES model is the model that yields the largest estimates of expected co-occurrences. The results are also in line with the intuitive expectation that genes with higher vertex degree give rise to more co-occurrences. However, it can be seen that this is not true for all null-models. In particular, it is not true for the GR and the LVD models, which do not consider gene vertex degrees. As outlined above, it is expected that the null-model that yields the highest estimates of expected co-occurrences should permit co-occurrence analysis with the highest stringency. In Fig. 2B, this hypothesis is tested directly again using the PubLiME data set [35]. For all null-models, co-occurrence analysis was carried out using module size 3 and support 5 (co-occurrence modules must be present in at least five publications). The choice of these parameters has been discussed in [35]. The number of co-occurrence modules was then determined that have a Z-score higher or equal than the cut-off shown in Fig. 2B. The Z-score is calculated from the mean and variance of the Poisson-binomial distribution as shown in the Materials and Methods section and published in [35]. More details on the probability distribution will be provided below. The GR and GVD models perform very poorly and identify large numbers of modules with high Z-scores. The LVD model performs a little better and approximates the BN and HG models at higher Z-score cut-offs. The BN and HG models give essentially identical results. However, the ES model is the model that yields the fewest number of significant co-occurrence modules and is thus the most stringent. The increased stringency of the ES model over the BN and HG models is also reflected in a higher signal-to-noise ratio calculated as the number of significant co-occurrence modules in the real bipartite graph divided by the number of modules found in a randomized bipartite graph (Fig. 2C). The reason for the superior stringency of the ES model over all other models can be explained by examining the average occurrence probability per gene and list vertex degree. Fig. 2D and E show the average occurrence probability of genes with the same gene vertex degree as a function of the gene vertex degree. It can be seen that the ES model yields higher occurrence probability estimates for genes with higher vertex degrees as compared to the BN and HG models. In GR and LVD models, gene vertex degrees are ignored and occurrence probabilities for genes with large vertex degree are very small, which is compensated by larger occurrence probabilities for genes with small vertex degree. The GVD model is identical to the ES model in this setting. Fig. 2E shows the average occurrence probability of all lists with the same vertex degree as a function of list vertex degree. It can be seen that the ES model provides higher occurrence probability estimates for large lists as compared to the BN and HG models. In this setting, the LVD model performs like the ES model while the GR and GVD models yield small occurrence probabilities for large lists. Since it has been shown above that long lists and genes with high vertex degree are responsible for a large part of the total number of co-occurrences for the most stringent null-models, the null-model that provides larger occurrence probability estimates for genes and lists with high vertex degree at the expense of lower estimates for smaller degrees will be the most stringent because large occurrence probabilities make co-occurrence more likely and thus less significant. By these criteria, the ES model is the most stringent of all models tested. The ES model as an approximation of the permutation null-model The data shown above have revealed that the ES model is the best of the models tested. One may wonder, however, whether yet more effective null-models can be found. An obvious choice would be the permutation model. In the permutation model, a complete permutation set of the bipartite graph is created such that each list is composed of distinct sets of genes. The number of graphs where a gene is present in a given list divided by the total number of permutations then provides the occurrence probability estimate. The permutation model is the ideal null-model because it is exhaustive. The problem is that a complete permutation set of bipartite graphs of some complexity is very time consuming to calculate. For example, the simple bipartite graph from Fig. 1A is part of a permutation set of 455 graphs. The number of permutations is increasing quickly as the numbers of genes and lists grow. However, since edge-swapping ensures that gene lists are composed of distinct sets of genes, each edge-swap produces a graph that is part of the permutation set of the bipartite graph. Edge-swapping can thus be viewed as a random sampling procedure from the permutation set of the bipartite graph. Therefore, occurrence probability estimates derived by edge-swapping should approximate those obtained from the permutation model. We generated a complete permutation set of the graph shown in Fig. 1A to verify this hypothesis. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3A shows how the number of possible permutations can be calculated. Gene1 is present in all lists and does not have an impact on the total number of permutations. Gene2, having vertex degree two, is present in two out of three lists in one out of three possible ways. The remaining genes have vertex degree 1 and can be freely chosen to fill the empty slots. We can now count exactly how many times a gene is linked to a list and divide these counts by 455, the size of the permutation set, to obtain exact occurrence probabilities. These numbers are shown in graphical form in Fig. 3B and in numerical form in Fig. 3C. Fig. 3B also shows the occurrence probability estimates obtained by edge-swapping side-by-side to the exact occurrence probabilities. The graph in Fig. 1A was subjected to edge-swapping 1000 times and the number of times a gene was found present in a list was divided by 1000 to obtain the occurrence probability. At each run, 100 random edge swaps were performed to ensure complete randomization of the graph. This procedure was repeated 10 times and the mean and standard deviation of occurrence probability estimates for each gene in each list are shown. In all cases, the mean differs from the real probability by less than two standard deviations, in most cases by less than one standard deviation. Thus, edge-swapping provides reliable estimates of exact occurrence probabilities as determined from a complete permutation set. As an interesting observation, we provide evidence that occurrence probabilities are non-linear functions of vertex degrees in the edge-swapping model. This is illustrated in Fig. 3C. Individual and average occurrence probabilities are shown as a function of gene and list vertex degrees. Non-linearity of individual occurrence probabilities can be verified from the counts table underneath the plots. However, the average occurrence probability is found to depend on vertex degrees in a linear fashion instead. This is a consequence of the fact that occurrence probabilities of a gene over all lists add up to the gene vertex degree and that the occurrence probabilities of all genes for a given list add up to the list vertex degree. At the same time, since the most stringent permutation based null-model predicts non-linear dependencies of individual occurrence probabilities on vertex degrees, assuming such linearity in statistical models of co-occurrence will be linked to loss of stringency. We conclude that the ES null-model is the null-model that permits co-occurrence analysis with the highest stringency among the models tested and that it closely approximates occurrence probabilities derived from an ideal permutation model. The increased stringency of the ES model over other models is a consequence of higher occurrence probabilities for genes and list with high vertex degrees, which are giving rise to a large part of all co-occurrences in the bipartite graph. Since large occurrence probabilities make co-occurrence more likely, the analysis becomes more stringent. Co-occurrence probabilities Co-occurrence analysis can be thought of as a Bernoulli experiment with a binomial outcome (a given combination of entries is either present or not present in a given list). Thus, the Binomial distribution (BD) is a natural choice for judging the significance of the number of co-occurrences. However, the BD is defined for a probability of success which is equal in all trials. The list-specific nature of occurrence probabilities is not compatible with this condition (analysis of each list represents one trial), which means that co-occurrence analysis in the presence of list-length-heterogeneity is better described as a series of Poisson trials, where the probability of success varies from trial to trial. Therefore, the significance of co-occurrences must be evaluated using a binomial distribution with trial-specific probabilities, i.e. the Poisson-binomial distribution (PBD). The probability of success in a single Poisson trial can be calculated by multiplying the list-specific occurrence probabilities for the combination of genes under study. The number of occurrence probabilities that need to be multiplied is equal to the module size, i.e. the number of genes whose combination is studied. An observed number of co-occurrences for a combination of genes can then be evaluated using the PBD, which is given by the formula [36]:(18) The structure of this formula is very similar to the structure of the formula used to calculate the binomial distribution, except that multiplication with a binomial coefficient is replaced by summation over individual terms, which makes calculation of P-values using (18) inefficient (note that equation numbering starts in the Materials and Methods section). Here, Ak denotes the kth set of indices of the i lists where genes are co-occurring (   success   ). There are possible sets and summation is carried out accordingly. denotes the set of indices of N   i lists where genes are not co-occurring (   failure   ). [36] have reported two fast procedures for calculating exact PBD P-values. However, both procedures work with probability ratios and suffer from numerical overflow/underflow problems for large numbers of trials. NetCutter uses two workarounds to circumvent this problem. One is based on using Poisson-binomial Z-scores, which can be calculated very easily instead (see below). The other relies on a fast approximation procedure for calculating Poisson-binomial P-values, which we call bi-binomial approximation (BBA) or bi-binomial distribution (BBD). Z-scores and P-values of BBD Given the mean u (1) and variance s2 (2) of PBD (see Materials and Methods), the Z-score associated with a given number of co-occurrences x is obtained as:(19) Considering the structure of formulae (1) and (2) (Materials and Methods section), PBD Z-scores can be calculated very easily and provide a simple estimate of the significance of co-occurrence modules. However, in contrast to normally distributed Z-scores, binomial and Poisson-binomial Z-scores do not correspond to the same P-value for different sets of probabilities of success. To see this, calculate for example the probability of success in a series of 100 Bernoulli trials with success probability 0.1 and 0.9 for the expectation of 10 and 90 successes, respectively. The Z-score will be 0 in both cases but the corresponding cumulative P-values are 0.5832 and 0.5487. Therefore, exact levels of significance cannot be derived from Z-scores alone. Thus, a fast and reliable procedure for calculating Poisson-binomial P-values is needed. The BBD approximation was developed to solve this problem. The BBD approximation of PBD P-values follows from the relationship between the variance of PBD and the population variance of trial-specific probabilities of success. This relationship is shown in Materials and Methods to be described by (4):(4) This equation shows that there is an inverse linear relationship between the population variance S2 of the N trial probabilities and the variance of PBD s2, which means that PBD becomes increasingly narrow as the variance of trial probabilities grows. It also shows that, for constant mean u and number of trials N, the shape of PBD depends only on the variance of trial probabilities. Therefore, relationship (4) suggests an easy way to approximate PBD P-values. The P-value can be obtained by constructing a set of trial probabilities with equal variance as the original set of trial probabilities, which, however, are not all different. In other words, the series of Poisson trials can be replaced by two sets of Bernoulli trials with trial probabilities p1 and p2 constructed such that the variance is equal to the original set of trial probabilities. This strategy is illustrated in Fig. 4 and explains why this approximation is called bi-binomial. The details on how to obtain the values of the two sets of Bernoulli trial probabilities and the number of trials with p1 and p2 as probabilities of success are provided in the Materials and Methods section. The precision of the BBD approximation is discussed in supplementary material Simulation S1. In order to evaluate whether BBD P-values as a significance measure of co-occurrence offer an advantage over other measures such as the Jaccard coefficient or the uncertainty coefficient, pair-wise co-occurrence of two genes in 200 lists with and without list-length-heterogeneity was studied (Fig. 5). Each gene is assumed to occur in 100 lists. Therefore, the occurrence probabilities of both genes over all 200 lists must add up to 100, regardless of list-length-heterogeneity. For simplicity, occurrence probabilities of both genes are assumed to be equal in any particular list. The co-occurrence probability in a list is then given by the square of the occurrence probability in that list. For all possible co-occurrences from 0 to 100, the Jaccard and uncertainty coefficients were calculated as detailed in the Materials and Methods section. In addition, cumulative BBD P-values were calculated using the co-occurrence probabilities as trial probabilities. To illustrate the advantage of BBD over BD as co-occurrence probability distribution, cumulative BD P-values of a BD with the same mean as BBD but constant trial probabilities is shown. These trial probabilities can be obtained by dividing the mean of BBD by the number of lists. Three different cases of list-length-heterogeneity are considered in Fig. 5: No heterogeneity (standard deviation 0), heterogeneity with standard deviation 0.283 and heterogeneity with standard deviation 0.401 in the occurrence probabilities. The Jaccard and uncertainty coefficients are by definition insensitive to list-length-heterogeneity because differences in co-occurrence probabilities in a given list cannot be considered in their calculation. This is because both coefficients are defined by the counts of the four list classes: both genes absent, both genes present, first gene absent second gene present, and first gene present second gene absent, i.e. by the corresponding contingency table, which does not change with different list-length-heterogeneity. In the absence of list-length-heterogeneity, the cumulative P-values of BD and BBD (which are perfectly overlapping as expected) assume 0.5 at 50 co-occurrences, which corresponds to the expected number of co-occurrences calculated as (50 = 100 occurrences per gene/200 lists)   2*200 lists. The uncertainty coefficient is found to be 0 and the Jaccard coefficient is 0.33333 at that point. When there is modest list-length-heterogeneity (standard deviation 0.283), the mean of BBD is shifting to the right. This is because the sum of squares of varying occurrence probabilities (i.e. the sum of co-occurrence probabilities used as trial probabilities, which is equal to the mean of BBD) is always larger than the sum of squares of constant occurrence probabilities with the same average occurrence probability (0.5). The corresponding BD in the presence of list-length-heterogeneity is obtained by dividing the expected number of co-occurrences by the total number of lists, which means assuming equal co-occurrences in all lists. This visualization is shown to illustrate how BBD (which is narrower than the corresponding BD) gives rise to a steeper cumulative distribution of P-values and as a consequence to more significant P-values for numbers of co-occurrence that are far from the expectation. As the level of list-length-heterogeneity grows (standard deviation of occurrence probabilities 0.401), the mean of BBD is shifted even further to the right and BBD P-values are distributed in a still steeper fashion as compared to corresponding BD P-values and the interval of non-significant co-occurrences is shrinking further. With modest list-length-heterogeneity, the expected number of co-occurrences is 66, which is associated with a Jaccard coefficient of 0.49 and an uncertainty coefficient of 0.075. In the case of large list-length-heterogeneity, the expected number of co-occurrences is 82 with J = 0.69 and UC = 0.32. Taken together, these data show that the expected number of co-occurrences varies strongly with the level of list-length-heterogeneity and that the expected number of co-occurrences is associated with different values of UC and J. To complicate matters further, 66 co-occurrences (J = 0.49, UC = 0.075) represent significant positive association (PBBD = 0.996) with equal list lengths, no significant association with modest differences in list length (PBBD = 0.536) and strongly negative association (meaning one gene excludes the other) with strong list-length-heterogeneity (PBBD = 0.00016). Thus, the same J and UC association measure is obtained for positive, negative, and absence of association. Therefore, the meaning of these measures cannot be interpreted properly in the absence of knowledge about the occurrence probabilities of the co-occurring entities. Furthermore, the data in Fig. 5 also show that neither J nor UC can distinguish between positive and negative association while this is easy with cumulative BBD P-values: Large P-values mean positive association and low P-values mean negative association. In summary, we conclude that BBD provides a novel association measure that offers a number of advantages over the existing contingency table based association measures Jaccard coefficient and uncertainty coefficient. The results in Fig. 5 also show that significance of association depends critically on the specific distribution of co-occurring entities over lists of varying length (because this distribution determines the occurrence probabilities) and that contingency table based methods (which cannot capture this distribution) should be avoided in the presence of significant list-length-heterogeneity. Generation of co-occurrence networks and the identification of communities The procedures outlined above allow the identification of significant co-occurrence modules in any type of bipartite graph. Three user defined parameters have an impact on the stringency of co-occurrence analysis: The module size, the support, and the Z-score/P-value cutoff. The module size determines how many entries will be tested for co-occurrence, the support sets a lower boundary on the required number of co-occurrences, and the Z-score/P-value cutoff sets the significance threshold. In general, higher module size leads to more stringent co-occurrence analysis at the cost of computational complexity. The support parameter allows limiting this complexity by filtering out co-occurrence modules which co-occur less frequently than required by the support. The significance cutoff permits adjusting the signal-to-noise ratio, which is calculated as the number of co-occurrence modules observed in the real versus a randomized bipartite graph. The impact of these parameters on the stringency of co-occurrence analysis has been reported previously for the PubLiME data set [35] and is illustrated in a simulation study provided as supplementary material Simulation S1. From the set of significant co-occurrence modules, a co-occurrence network is generated by considering each entry a vertex and drawing an edge between any two vertices, which have been part of the same significant co-occurrence module [35]. An important question in the analysis of co-occurrence networks regards the presence of network communities. Communities can be understood as groups of vertices with the property that the number of edges running within groups is larger than expected by chance and that the number of edges running between groups is lower than expected by chance [37]. This problem of partitioning a graph is often referred to as the graph-cut problem (hence the name NetCutter). NetCutter is built on the Java Universal Network and Graph framework (JUNG) software package (http://jung.sourceforge.net), which provides algorithms for solving this problem. In particular, NetCutter implements the Bicomponent clustering algorithm [38], the Edge-Betweenness clustering algorithm [39], and the Exact Flow Community algorithm [40]. Furthermore, there is a clustering tool that is not part of the JUNG package, namely an algorithm identifying communities using eigenvectors of the modularity matrix [37]. The code for this algorithm was kindly provided by Mark Newman in C++ and ported to Java. In addition to these tools, NetCutter provides a number of convenience functions for the analysis of co-occurrence networks, such as testing the significance of lists reporting a set of entries making up a network community, ranking of vertices, random graph generators for topological analysis of co-occurrence networks, and others. Details on all functions are provided in the NetCutter software documentation. One of the possible applications of NetCutter is illustrated below. This application is tightly linked to the bipartite graph representation of the data. Namely, NetCutter can be used to perform co-occurrence analysis of genes or list derived from the same bipartite graph. The network communities identified in each both reflect the same underlying structure of the bipartite graph. In the case of gene expression signatures stored in PubLiME, clusters of genes correspond to clusters of publications, which can reveal possible functions of gene clusters. Cluster correspondence and association studies The co-occurrence analysis of the PubLiME data set published previously [35] identified 5 major network communities of genes with consistent functional annotations that are deregulated in cancer related gene expression signatures. This analysis was performed by considering all genes mentioned in a particular publication as a single signature, even though they might have been part of different tables and cluster analyses. Here we present an advanced analysis of the PubLiME data set where each table and/or cluster identified in a given publication is considered as a separate signature. This brings the total number of signatures to be analyzed to 1015 comprising a total of 7358 differentially regulated genes derived from 233 publications reporting cancer related signatures derived from human samples. We use this analysis to illustrate three major points: First, the set of communities reported previously is reproduced by this more fine-grained analysis. Second, the set of gene communities corresponds to a set of publication communities. Third, associations between publications and gene communities can be calculated with higher stringency using the edge-swapping null-model in conjunction with bi-binomial P-values as compared to binomial or hypergeometric statistics. The bipartite graph to be analyzed is composed of PubMedID_listID-gene pairs (see supplementary material Table S1). Co-occurrence analysis was carried out in two ways: First, gene co-occurrence was analyzed and communities of co-occurring genes were defined by edge-betweenness clustering as described in Materials and Methods. Second, co-occurrence of PubMedID_listIDs was analyzed. To this end, the order of PubMedID_listID-gene pairs was reversed to form GENE-PUBMEDID_LISTID pairs. Thus, the lists in the resulting bipartite graph are formed by genes and the entries are the PubMedID_listIDs where the genes are reported as differentially regulated. Occurrence probabilities for the reversed bipartite graph can be obtained by transposing the occurrence probability matrix of the original bipartite graph. Since the gene communities identified in gene co-occurrence analysis reflect the structure inherent in the bipartite graph (which is not affected by reversing the list-entry order), co-occurrence analysis of the reversed bipartite graph will result in PubMedID_listID communities that reflect the same underlying structure in the bipartite graph. In other words, PubMedID_listID communities correspond to gene communities. In less abstract terms, the PubMedID_listID communities should correspond to sets of publications that report similar sets of genes as differentially regulated. The identification of communities of publications can help the researcher to easily identify publications studying genes in a gene community that is of interest to the researcher. The results of both types of co-occurrence analysis are displayed in Fig. 6. Fig. 6A shows the gene clusters identified. The clusters are named after significant enrichments of gene categories as determined by functional category enrichment using DAVID [41]. The P-values shown are Benjamini corrected for multiple testing as reported by DAVID. The clusters are very similar to the clusters published previously [35]. There is one new cluster that is strongly enriched for ribosomal proteins (   protein biosynthesis    cluster), which has not reached significance in our previous analysis. The    surface antigen    cluster contains many genes that had been reported as part of the    signal transduction    cluster. Altogether, however, these results strongly support the notion that the gene clusters in the PubLiME data set can be reproduced by the more fine-grained analysis that considers sublists in each publication as separate signatures. The corresponding clusters of PubMedID_listIDs are shown in Fig. 6B. There are five clusters, which have been named after their corresponding gene cluster. Only one cluster (the    extracellular matrix-immune response cluster   ) cannot be separated by edge-betweenness clustering at the point of maximal graph modularity. To see that this naming is indeed justified, we needed to investigate how strongly a given PubMedID_listID is associated with a given gene cluster, i.e. how significant is the overlap of the genes reported in a gene cluster and the genes reported in a PubMedID_listID. Binomial or hypergemetric statistics are generally used to calculate this significance. However, the bipartite graph model in conjunction with the edge-swapping null-model offers a more fine-grained approach based on bi-binomial statistics. The edge-swapping null-model determines occurrence probabilities in such a way that the number of genes in a given PubMedID_listID is associated with insignificant P-values in the context of the complete bipartite graph. However, when a subset of genes is analyzed, e.g. all the genes that are reported in a particular list, the P-value associated with the number of genes contained in this list will likely be highly significant according to how unlikely it is to obtain all the genes contained in a given list in a random draw from all genes present in the bipartite graph. Thus, PubMedID_listID association with a set of genes in the bipartite graph model can be calculated in the following way: The set of genes that is used to analyze association is used to extract a subgraph from the original bipartite graph where occurrence probabilities for each gene-PubMedID_listID pair are identical to those in the original bipartite graph (i.e. they are not recalculated by edge-swapping). The vertex degree of the PubMedID_listID vertices in the subgraph indicates the number of genes contained in each PubMedID_listID overlapping with the set of genes used to extract the subgraph. From the occurrence probabilities of the genes in a given PubMedID_listID, the bi-binomial P-value can then be calculated for every list vertex degree observed in the subgraph. In Fig. 7, the significance of association of the PubMedID_listIDs (see Fig. 6B) with the cell cycle cluster of genes (Fig. 6A) is calculated. For comparison, binomial and hypergeometric P-values are also shown. It can be seen that the bi-binomial P-value is larger than the binomial and hypergeometric P-values, which means that the strength of association is evaluated in a more stringent manner using BBD statistics (see Discussion for an explanation of this observation). The analysis of significant associations between PubMedID_listIDs and gene clusters now permit answering the question whether there is correspondence between gene clusters and PubMedID_listID clusters. The naming of PubMedID_listID clusters shown in Fig. 6B is based on the number of PubMedID_listID that are significantly associated with gene clusters shown in Fig. 6A. First, for each gene cluster, all the PubMedID_listIDs that are associated with that cluster with more than 95% confidence (i.e. cumulative bi-binomial P-values> = 0.95) were identified. Second, the number of significant PubMedID_listIDs in each PubMedID_listID cluster was counted for every gene cluster. The significance of this number was then calculated using binomial statistics. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1. Negative decadic logarithms of the binomial P-value are displayed. It is apparent that each PubMedID_listID cluster is strongly associated with at least one gene cluster, except for the    extracellular matrix-immune response    cluster, which is associated with two gene clusters. The strength of these associations suggests that the PubMedID_listID clusters are indeed corresponding to the gene clusters and that both the gene and the PubMedID_listID clusters reflect the structure of the bipartite graph representing the PubLiME data set. Details about all the lists analyzed are attached as supplementary material Table S2. Looking at these lists, some general conclusions about the gene clusters can be drawn. Cell cycle cluster genes have been found deregulated in a wide variety of tumor types such as colon cancer, breast cancer, in biliary tract cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, T-cell leukemia, glioma, acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemias, soft tissue sarcoma, neuroblastoma, as well as in a number of cellular model systems in response to different stimuli. Thus, the cell cycle cluster seems to consist of genes with a general role in oncogenesis. The surface antigen cluster instead seems to be derived preferentially from studies on leukemia. The interferon cluster genes are found deregulated in virus induced pathologies such as papilloma virus induced cervical cancer, and viral hepatitis. Immune response cluster genes were reported as differentially regulated in inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and Helicobacter pylori infections. Genes of the extracellular matrix cluster seem to be associated with cancer progression studies and metastatic potential. For the protein biosynthesis cluster, there are 15 signatures that are significantly enriched for those genes. The cancers studied comprise medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, multiple myeloma, and lymphocytic leukemia. The genes are also found deregulated in response to DNA damage. Although the number of signatures is limited, the variation in conditions where the genes are deregulated is compatible with the hypothesis that protein biosynthesis genes, as cell cycle genes, are deregulated in many cancer types, which might reflect the general property of cancer cells to divide and grow in an uncontrolled fashion. Discussion Here we have investigated basic aspects of co-occurrence analysis and present a software tool, NetCutter, which can be used to identify and analyze generic co-occurrence networks. In NetCutter, a co-occurrence data set is represented as a bipartite graph with one part representing lists and the other part list entries whose co-occurrence patterns are studied. The bipartite graph representation of co-occurrence data sets allows the efficacy of different null-models to be tested systematically. We have shown that an edge-swapping procedure used to randomize the bipartite graph generates a null-model that allows co-occurrence analysis with the highest stringency. The other null-models tested here tend to underestimate occurrence probabilities of entries per list for lists and genes with high vertex degrees, i.e. for lists and genes where most co-occurrences are observed. As a result, co-occurrences are judged more significant than they really are. Co-occurrence data sets with exactly equal lists lengths are likely to be the exception from the rule. It can be assumed that some list-length-heterogeneity will be present in most circumstances. An important consequence of list-length-heterogeneity regards the co-occurrence probability distribution used to evaluate the significance of the observed number of co-occurrences. Co-occurrence analysis in the presence of list-length-heterogeneity is best performed using the Poisson-binomial distribution (a binomial distribution with trial specific probabilities). However, calculating Poisson-binomial P-values for large numbers of lists is difficult using existing procedures [36]. We have presented an approximation to the Poisson-binomial distribution, called bi-binomial distribution, which is based on replacing the set of Poisson trials by two sets of Bernoulli trials. The resulting distribution reproduces the Poisson-binomial distribution nearly exactly and its P-values can be calculated with ease even for thousands of lists (see also supplementary material Simulation S1 for details on the precision of BBD). Importantly, BBD provides a novel measure of association, which is shown to be superior to existing measures such as the Jaccard coefficient and the uncertainty coefficient, whose values cannot be interpreted properly in the absence of knowledge about the occurrence probabilities of co-occurring entities. It is worth noting that Poisson-binomial Z-scores are distinguished from Gaussian Z-scores by the fact that they do not correspond to the same P-value for different PBDs, BBDs, and even BDs. This is because the Z-score is an explicit part of the function defining the normal probability density while it is not part of the definitions of BD, PBD, and BBD densities. As a consequence, the simple Poisson-binomial Z-score based approach to evaluating significance of co-occurrence must be complemented with the BBD to approximate Poisson-binomial P-values in order to enable multiple testing corrections and to allow calculation of confidence levels in association studies precisely. However, NetCutter is equipped with a bipartite graph randomization tool that permits measuring the number of false positives due to multiple testing directly by comparing the number of significant co-occurrence modules in the real bipartite graph to the corresponding number in a randomized version thereof. Randomization is performed by edge-swapping in order to preserve vertex degrees. The resulting signal-to-noise ratios that are plotted for each Z-score/P-value cutoff provide a highly reliable and visually intuitive defense mechanism against false positives (see also supplementary material Simulation S1). In the vast majority of co-occurrence studies, pair-wise co-occurrences have been analyzed using different statistical models. We have observed that the stringency of pair-wise co-occurrence analysis is far below the stringency of co-occurrence analysis using higher order combinations of co-occurring entities [35]. In NetCutter, co-occurrence analysis is preceded by occurrence analysis, i.e. the occurrence probability of each entry in each list is determined. Starting from occurrence probabilities, co-occurrence probabilities for any size of co-occurrence modules under study can be obtained by multiplying the respective list-specific occurrence probabilities. Given the list-specific co-occurrence probabilities, bi-binomial P-values are then calculated in exactly the same way for any module size. As a consequence, NetCutter can perform co-occurrence analysis for higher order combinations of co-occurring entries (i.e. larger module sizes) using the same statistical model. One of the benefits of using higher module sizes is robustness of the analyses in the presence of noise. This is because each edge in the resulting co-occurrence network is evaluated many times since every pair of co-occurring entries can be part of many higher order co-occurrence modules [35]. Another advantage is that implicit relationships between entries, which have never occurred together [18], can be derived as a natural by-product of using module sizes larger than 2. As shown in a simulation study (supplementary material Simulation S1), the result is a dramatic reduction of misclassifications at higher module sizes. NetCutter can be used to calculate the strength of association between a subset of entries and lists reporting those entries. In this case, the analysis is performed on a subgraph of the original bipartite graph. The subgraph can correspond to communities of entries in the co-occurrence network, or any set of entries of interest. NetCutter will then calculate the significance of observing a given number of occurrences of an entry in the user defined subset of lists using bi-binomal statistics. This analysis mode corresponds to association studies with the advantage that the structure of the underlying bipartite graph (i.e. list length heterogeneity) is considered and handled appropriately using the bi-binomial distribution. As a consequence, association studies can be performed with higher stringency. This result can be understood by examining the occurrence probability matrix that is implicitly assumed in performing binomial or hypergeometric tests for the significance of overlaps. In both tests, a gene is assumed to have an equal opportunity to be present in a list. Therefore, the probability of success for a gene to be part of a list is given by the list vertex degree divided by the total number of genes. In other words, both tests are implicitly based on the list vertex degree model, which has been shown previously to underestimate the occurrence probability and the expected number of co-occurrences for genes with high vertex degree (see Fig. 2A). Since the BBD P-values are calculated from the ES-model, which assigns higher occurrence probabilities to genes with higher vertex degree and more expected co-occurrences, the observed number of overlaps between a set of genes of interest and the content of a given list (which can be viewed as co-occurrence of the overlapping genes in that list) will be judged less significant when the overlapping genes are of high vertex degree (and vice versa when the overlapping genes are of low vertex degree) as compared to binomial or hypergeometric tests. Since the BBD P-values are derived from the most stringent ES null-model, BBD P-values provide a more reliable estimate for the significance of overlap. Co-occurrence analysis of data represented as bipartite graphs permits visualizing the structure of the bipartite graph either as communities of list entries (genes) or as communities of lists (PubMedID_ListID) in co-occurrence networks. We have analyzed the PubLiME data set for the presence of corresponding gene and list clusters. In addition to previously published clusters of genes, we describe a novel gene cluster that is composed of protein biosynthesis associated genes [35]. We found that the corresponding clusters of PubMedID_ListID (gene expression signatures) are in general strongly enriched for genes reported in the corresponding gene cluster and that interrogation of corresponding clusters can be used to deduct hypotheses about the putative function of gene clusters. In addition to co-occurrence analysis, NetCutter offers a number of tools for the analysis of co-occurrence networks, or any undirected graph. In particular, community identification is supported by four different community identification algorithms. NetCutter also offers a range of convenience functions that are of help in network analysis. Worthy of mentioning are the random graph generators that can provide control graphs for topological studies. The complete set of options is described in the software documentation. In summary, we present a general framework for co-occurrence analysis with many potential applications. We illustrate a number of advantages of using the bipartite graph representation of data and the associated statistics. In particular, the identification of corresponding clusters permits the identification of functional subunits such as gene clusters on the one hand, and the generation of hypotheses about the function of those units by analyzing the corresponding list clusters on the other hand. Future developments will be directed towards the analysis of data sets that are considerably larger than the data sets analyzed so far. For example, co-occurrence analysis might be of interest for the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data sets and association studies of genome variability with disease. Each patient is characterized by a specific range of SNPs. Co-occurrence patterns of patients according to their SNPs could be compared to clinical parameters with the aim of identifying genomic regions associated with disease. The increased stringency of association studies offered by NetCutter may be of use in the analysis of polygenic diseases where conventional methods fail. For being useful in this setting, NetCutter must be capable of analyzing bipartite graphs with millions instead of thousands of vertices. Materials and Methods Implementation of NetCutter NetCutter is written in Java using NetBeans6 software (http://www.netbeans.info/) and tested on the Java Runtime environment 1.6.0.0. on a Windows XP Professional computer. The Java Runtime environment, which can be downloaded from http://java.sun.com/, must be installed on a computer that is intended to run NetCutter. NetCutter is provided as a single jar file and should run by double clicking the jar file, provided that the Java runtime environment is properly installed. NetCutter makes use of the following software packages and classes: JUNG version 1.3 (http://jung.sourceforge.net/download.html), Apache Jakarta Commons Collections 3.1 (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/), Cern Colt Scientific Library 1.2.0 (http://dsd.lbl.gov/hoschek/colt/), Xerces (http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/index.html), Jama (http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/), Netlib Java LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/), JFreeChart (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/), partition.java (http://astro.u-strasbg.fr/fmurtagh/mda-sw/java/partition.java). Bi-binomial approximation of Poisson-binomial distribution The Poisson-binomial distribution (binomial distribution with trial specific probabilities) has recently been proposed as a statistic that properly handles largely differing sizes of gene expression signatures in meta-analysis of gene expression data [35]. Z-scores have been used to estimate the significance of co-occurrence because P-value calculation is cumbersome and error prone. Two methods reported by [36] suffer from numerical overflow/underflow problems when large numbers of Poisson trials with probabilities deviating significantly from 0.5 are being analyzed. Therefore, we propose a fast approximation of P-values based on a bi-binomial distribution. The bi-binomial distribution is a special case of the Poisson-binomial distribution where the probability of success can assume only two values. In order to achieve a good approximation of the underlying Poisson-binomial distribution, the values of these two probabilities and the number of trials where they are assumed must be determined carefully. As is shown in the following, the values of the two trial probabilities and their number of occurrences follow from the formula used to calculate the variance of the Poisson-binomial distribution and from the formula yielding the population variance of trial probabilities of the Poisson-binomial distribution to be approximated. The mean u and the variance s2 of the Poisson-binomial distribution are given by equation (1) and (2), respectively.(1)(2)pi is the trial-specific probability of success and N is the total number of trials. For the sake of completeness, a formal proof of equation (1) is reported as supplementary material Proof S1 and the proof of equation (2) can be obtained in an analogous fashion. The population variance S2 of trial probabilities pi is given by equation (3).(3) Rearranging equation (3) considering (1) and (2) leads to (4) and (5), where pa denotes the average trial probability of success and qa its complement.(4)(5)Now let's define two trial probabilities p1 and p2, which are used N1 and N2 times during the Poisson trials, respectively. Thus, N1 and N2 add up to N.(6) Considering (1), the average trial probability pa can then be obtained from (7).(7) Using (7), p1 can thus be calculated as (8).(8) Similarly, considering (2), the variance s2 is given by (9).(9) Substituting p1 in (9) using (8) followed by substituting s2 in (5) by (9) leads to a quadratic equation for p2 as a function of pa, N, and S2, as shown in equation (10).(10) The solution to (10) is given by (11).(11) Setting p2 to(12)p1 can be obtained from (8) and shown to be given by formula (13):(13)Choosing p2 as(12a)leads to p1(13a) Comparing (13a) to (12) and (12a) to (13), it can be seen that the formulae are identical except for the fact that N1 and N2 are reversed. Since the assignment of which set of trials is called N1 and which set of trials is called N2 is completely arbitrary, we can limit the remaining analysis on (12) and (13) without loss of generality. Note that (12) and (13) do not guarantee that p1 and p2 are always confined between 0 and 1 for any combination of N1 and N2. While probabilities smaller than 0 or bigger than 1 would still result in a distribution with the same overall variance as the original distribution, P-value calculation will be imprecise because the tails of the distribution will deviate significantly from the original distribution. Thus, we need to define the values N1 and N2 in such a way that p2< = 1 and p1> = 0. This can be achieved by evaluating (12) and (13). Evaluating (12) for the condition that p2< = 1, solving the resulting inequality for N2, and considering (5), which relates S2 and s2, we obtain (14).(14) Similarly, evaluating (13) for the condition p1> = 0, solving the resulting inequality for N2, considering (5), which relates S2 and s2, and defining uf the expected number of failures as N * (1   pa) (15),(15)we obtain (16)(16) The meaning of these boundaries is best illustrated by considering a Poisson-binomial distribution whose variance is 0, i.e. that assumes 1 at X = u and 0 otherwise. In this case (14) requires N2< = u while (16) requires N2> = u. These conditions can only be fulfilled contemporaneously when N2 is set to u. Intuitively, this means that there are u trials with probability of success 1 and N   u trials with probability of 0, resulting in a Poisson-binomial distribution with variance s2 = 0 and mean u. When s2 is larger than 0, the choice of N1 and N2 is more flexible. However, since the choice of N2 = u is valid for all possible values of s2, this is how NetCutter determines N1 and N2. When u is not an integer, N2 is set to the integer closest to u. Having determined p2 (12) and p1 (13) as well a N1 and N2 (14, 16, 6), we can now calculate the bi-binomial approximation of the Poisson-binomial distribution in a fashion that is very similar to calculate the binomial P-value. With q1 = 1   p1 and q2 = 1   p2 we obtain:(17) The summation is necessary because i successes can be obtained from any combination of j p1 and i   j p2 trials, where j can assume any value from 0 to i. Calculating Jaccard and uncertainty coefficients For the purpose of comparing the efficacy of the bi-binomial distribution as a significance measure of co-occurrence, Jaccard and uncertainty coefficients (which are also called measures of association) were calculated using the formulae: The Jaccard coefficient J is calculated as the number of times A and B occur together divided by the number of times A occurs without B plus the number of times B occurs without A plus the number of times A and B occur together [42]. The uncertainty coefficient [42] is calculated as:H is the entropy associated with A, B, and AB. For A, the entropy is calculated from the probabilities of A occurring in n1 out of N lists (n1/N) and A not occurring in n2 out of N lists (n2/N). Analogous calculations lead to the entropy associated with B. For H(A,B), the probabilities of A occurring without B, B occurring without A, A and B occurring together, and neither A nor B occurring in the lists are used. Co-occurrence analysis of the PubLiME data set The bipartite graph to be analyzed is composed of 27619 PubMedID_listID-gene pairs (see supplementary material Table S1). Edge-swapping (1000 simulations, see above) was used to determine occurrence probabilities and gene co-occurrence was analyzed using module size 3 (co-occurrence of three genes), bi-binomial Z-score cutoff 6, bi-binomial P-value cutoff 1.0E-5, and support 5. Supplementary material Simulation S1 provides details on why module size 3 is chosen. The support parameter ensures that each 3-gene co-occurrence module is present in at least 5 signatures. We identified 1654 significant modules in the test data compared to 5 modules in a randomized bipartite graph, corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio of 331. The co-occurrence network was generated from the significant co-occurrence modules by drawing an edge between each pair wise combination of genes that are part of the same co-occurrence module. Gene communities were identified in this network by edge-betweenness clustering removing 4 edges, which resulted in a maximal network modularity of 0.63. Modularity is calculated as described by [43]. For the identification of PubMedID_listID clusters, the PubMedID_listID-gene pairs in the original bipartite graph were reversed to form gene-PubMedID_listID pairs. Occurrence probabilities were obtained by transposing the original occurrence probability matrix determined by edge-swapping as described above. PubMedID_listID co-occurrence was analyzed using module size 5, Z-score cutoff 6, bi-binomial P-value cutoff 1.0E-5, and support 3. Please note that the choice of these parameters is dictated by the parameters used in gene co-occurrence analysis. The reversal of the bipartite graph necessitates the support parameter used in gene co-occurrence analysis (5) to be used as module size in PubMedID_listID co-occurrence analysis and the module size used in gene co-occurrence analysis (3) to be used as the support parameter in PubMedID_listID co-occurrence analysis if the scope of the analysis is the identification of PubMedID_listID clusters that correspond to gene clusters identified before. The significance cutoffs remain unchanged. PubMedID_listID co-occurrence analysis revealed 448 significant co-occurrence modules in the real bipartite graph and 6 significant co-occurrence modules in the randomized bipartite graph with a signal-to-noise ratio of 75. Communities in the resulting co-occurrence network were identified by edge-betweenness clustering removing 130 edges. The resulting maximal network modularity was found to be 0.47.

1621059|t|Case report: rapidly fatal bowel ischaemia on clozapine treatment
1621059|a|Abstract Background There have been previous reported deaths due to clozapine-induced constipation. In all these cases patients have experienced prior abdominal symptoms over a period of weeks or months. Case presentation We report the sudden death due to constipation of a healthy young male patient on clozapine without any known history of prior abdominal symptoms. Conclusion Psychiatrists need to be alert to the medical emergencies which can occur in the context of clozapine treatment and also need to make other clinicians who may have contact with their patients aware of these. Background There have been six previously published cases of death secondary to clozapine-induced constipation [1-3]. Of these, two patients died from faecal peritonitis, two from aspiration of faeculent vomitus as a result of bowel obstruction and two from bowel necrosis. In all these cases there had been prior complaints of constipation and/or other abdominal symptoms for weeks to months before the fatal event. Here we describe a case of constipation, presumably clozapine-induced, where death from bowel ischaemia occured within 2 days from the first complaint of constipation and without any prior reported abdominal symptoms which might have provided a warning to the clinicians involved. Case presentation A 20-year-old male with a year long history of schizophrenia which had been unresponsive to trials of two atypical antipsychotic drugs was commenced on clozapine. The dose was titrated over the next year to 900 mg daily. Due to persisting negative symptoms amisulpiride 400 mg twice daily was added with good response after one month. The patient was reviewed regularly over the next year, continued to improve and did not report any side effects to members of the multidisciplinary mental health team working to support him in the community. He appeared to be fit and healthy. Although he usually lived in supported accommodation he was staying temporarily with his family and from their account he complained of having constipation for 2 days before presenting to his GP with severe abdominal pain. He was prescribed medication and returned home but his condition deteriorated further and a few hours later an ambulance was called. He collapsed and died before reaching hospital. Post mortem examination revealed that he had impacted faeces which had pressed against the bowel wall causing ischaemia. This had led to infarction of this part of the bowel. Conclusion This case demonstrates that death can occur over a very short time course from constipation, in this case presumably induced by clozapine. Death from constipation and subsequent bowel infarction is relatively common in elderly patients and infarction causes a far more rapid and dangerous deterioration than does intestinal obstruction. In the present case this meant that this patient did not have any contact with psychiatric services between the onset of his symptoms and his rapid demise, in spite of regular follow-up. Although the risk of neutropenia is relatively well-known, it should be borne in mind that clozapine is reported to be associated with a number of other syndromes which may be rapidly fatal including not only constipation and obstruction but also cardiovascular collapse, seizures and ketoacidosis. Psychiatrists working with such patients should not only themselves be vigilant regarding such complications but should take steps to see that other clinicians to whom the patient may present are also aware of them.

1526545|t|B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) isoforms in systemic lupus erythematosus: disease activity correlates better with blood leukocyte BLyS mRNA levels than with plasma BLyS protein levels
1526545|a|Abstract Considerable evidence points to a role for B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) overproduction in murine and human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Nevertheless, the correlation between circulating levels of BLyS protein and disease activity in human SLE is modest at best. This may be due to an inadequacy of the former to reflect endogenous BLyS overproduction faithfully, in that steady-state protein levels are affected not just by production rates but also by rates of peripheral utilization and excretion. Increased levels of BLyS mRNA may better reflect increased in vivo BLyS production, and therefore they may correlate better with biologic and clinical sequelae of BLyS overexpression than do circulating levels of BLyS protein. Accordingly, we assessed peripheral blood leukocyte levels of BLyS mRNA isoforms (full-length BLyS and DBLyS) and plasma BLyS protein levels in patients with SLE, and correlated these levels with laboratory and clinical features. BLyS protein, full-length BLyS mRNA, and DBLyS mRNA levels were greater in SLE patients (n = 60) than in rheumatoid arthritis patients (n = 60) or normal control individuals (n = 30). Although full-length BLyS and DBLyS mRNA levels correlated significantly with BLyS protein levels in the SLE cohort, BLyS mRNA levels were more closely associated with serum immunoglobulin levels and SLE Disease Activity Index scores than were BLyS protein levels. Moreover, changes in SLE Disease Activity Index scores were more closely associated with changes in BLyS mRNA levels than with changes in BLyS protein levels among the 37 SLE patients from whom repeat blood samples were obtained. Thus, full-length BLyS and DBLyS mRNA levels are elevated in SLE and are more closely associated with disease activity than are BLyS protein levels. BLyS mRNA levels may be a helpful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE patients. Introduction B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS; a trademark of Human Genome Sciences, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) is a 285-amino-acid member of the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily [1-3]. A causal relation between constitutive overproduction of BLyS and development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like illness has incontrovertibly been established in mice. BLyS-transgenic mice often develop SLE-like features as they age [3-5], and SLE-prone (NZB x NZW)F1 (BWF1) and MRL-lpr/lpr mice respond clinically to treatment with BLyS antagonists (decreased disease progression and improved survival) [3,6]. Considerable inferential evidence points to a role for BLyS overproduction in human SLE as well. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated elevated circulating levels of BLyS in 20-30% of human SLE patients tested at a single point in time [7,8]. Moreover, a 12-month longitudinal study documented persistently elevated serum BLyS levels in about 25% of SLE patients and intermittently elevated serum BLyS levels in an additional 25% of patients [9]. Remarkably, circulating BLyS levels did not correlate with disease activity (measured using the SLE Disease Activity Index [SLEDAI]) in these cross-sectional or longitudinal studies [7-9]. Although a statistically significant correlation between circulating BLyS levels and SLEDAI has been appreciated in a more recent 24-month longitudinal study of 245 SLE patients (with >1,700 plasma samples analyzed) [10], the correlation remains weak. The limited correlation between circulating BLyS protein levels and disease activity in these studies may have exposed an inadequacy of the former to reflect faithfully endogenous BLyS overproduction. In addition to the rate of BLyS protein production, several other factors (for example, utilization and excretion) can affect circulating BLyS protein levels. Although there are no practicable means of directly measuring in vivo BLyS production per se in humans, the level of BLyS mRNA may serve as a better surrogate marker of in vivo BLyS production than does the level of BLyS protein. Candidate BLyS mRNA isoforms include the full-length BLyS mRNA isoform, which encodes the full-length protein, and the alternatively spliced DBLyS mRNA isoform, which encodes a protein with a small peptide deletion [11]. (DBLyS does not bind to cells expressing BLyS receptors, and therefore it has no agonistic activity. Moreover, DBLyS can form heterotrimers with full-length BLyS, thereby actually functioning as a dominant-negative antagonist of BLyS activity.) In this report we demonstrate that peripheral blood leukocytes from SLE patients express elevated mRNA levels of both full-length BLyS and DBLyS relative to those levels expressed by patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or by normal control individuals. In the SLE patients, both full-length BLyS and DBLyS mRNA levels are more closely associated with disease activity (SLEDAI) than are BLyS protein levels. Accordingly, BLyS mRNA levels may be a helpful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE patients. Materials and methods General details This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Southern California and the Scripps Research Institute. All participants gave their written informed consent before participation in this study. Participants Patients receiving outpatient medical care at the rheumatology clinics of the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center were recruited into the study. Diagnoses of SLE (n = 60) or RA (n = 60) were based on established clinical criteria [12]. Healthy control individuals (n = 30) were recruited from Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center and University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine personnel. No exclusions were made on any basis other than an inability to give informed consent. Each patient's sex, race, age, and medications at the time of the phlebotomy were recorded (Table 1). Based solely on the patient's willingness to donate a second blood sample, repeat blood samples were collected from 37 of the SLE patients 147-511 days (median 371 days) after collection of the first samples. These patients were not selected on the basis of any demographic, clinical, or laboratory feature. Clinical disease activity for the SLE patients was assessed using the SLEDAI [13] and using a modified SLEDAI that excludes the contribution of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies from the total score. Each patient's medical chart was reviewed for results of standard clinical laboratory tests within the previous or subsequent 1-month period. Plasma BLyS determination Whole venous blood was centrifuged to yield plasma and a buffy coat. The plasma was harvested, stored at -70oC, and assayed for BLyS levels by ELISA [8,14] using Fab fragments of the capture antibody rather than the whole antibody to reduce assay interference by rheumatoid factor. The lower limit of detection in this assay is 0.3 ng/ml. For statistical purposes, plasma samples with BLyS concentrations below the lower limit of detection were assigned a value of 0.25 ng/ml. Blood BLyS mRNA determination The buffy coat from centrifuged whole blood was harvested, added to RNAlater  (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) at a 1:4 vol/vol ratio for RNA stabilization, stored at -70oC, and assayed for full-length BLyS and DBLyS mRNA levels by real-time PCR. Total RNA was purified from buffy coat samples using RNAeasy miniprep kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and contaminating genomic DNA was removed by DNAse-I digestion. One-tenth volume of total RNA was used as template in the first-strand cDNA reaction using oligo-dT and the Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Duplicate samples of cDNA were amplified with primers against b-actin, full-length BLyS, or DBLyS: b-actin sense 5'-CGAGAAGATGACCCAGATCATGT-3'; b-actin anti-sense 5'-GGCATACCCCTCGTAGATGG-3'; full-length BLyS sense 5'-GCAGACAGTGAAACACCAACTATAC-3'; DBLyS sense 5'-CAGAAGAAACAGGATCTTACACAT-3'; and full-length BLyS/DBLyS anti-sense 5'-TGCCAGCTGAATAGCAGGAATTAT-3'. A 165 bp amplicon for b-actin was PCR-amplified using the 7900 HT ABI Prism machine (Qiagen) with annealing at 65oC. A 296 bp amplicon for full-length BLyS was PCR-amplified, with annealing at 64oC. A 270 bp amplicon for DBLyS was PCR-amplified with annealing at 61oC. The annealing conditions for full-length BLyS and DBLyS were determined so that each primer set remained specific to the respective BLyS isoform and yielded a PCR efficiency similar to those of cloned cDNA standards. Melting curve analysis revealed a single peak for each gene amplified. The threshold cycle (Ct) values for each reaction were determined using Sequence Detection System software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Results are presented as ratios of full-length BLyS or DBLyS mRNA to b-actin mRNA, which were calculated using the following formulae: 2 exp(Ctb-actin - Ctfull-length BLyS) 2 exp(Ctb-actin - CtDBLyS) Determination of anti-BLyS autoantibodies BLyS was bound to microtiter plates by first coating the plates with streptavidin and then adding biotinylated recombinant BLyS. Using these plates as the capture reagent, plasma samples were incubated, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgA/IgM/IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, USA; 1:20,000 final dilution) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG (Southern Biotechnology; 1:10,000 final dilution) were used as the detector reagents. Statistical analysis All analyses were performed using SigmaStat software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results that did not follow a normal distribution were log-transformed to achieve normality. Parametric testing between two matched or unmatched groups was performed using the paired or unpaired t test, respectively. Parametric testing among three or more groups was performed using one-way analysis of variance. When log-transformation failed to generate normally distributed data or the equal variance test was not satisfied, nonparametric testing was performed using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test between two groups and by Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks among three or more groups. Correlations were determined using Pearson product moment correlation for interval data and using Spearman rank order correlation for ordinal data or for interval data that did not follow a normal distribution. Nominal data were analyzed using X2 analysis-of-contingency tables. Results Elevated plasma BLyS levels and blood levels of full-length BLyS and DBLyS mRNA isoforms in systemic lupus erythematosus patients Previous reports of elevated circulating BLyS levels in SLE patients were based on a BLyS ELISA that utilized a whole (unfragmented) capture anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody [7-9]. Since the publication of these reports, it has been recognized that the presence of rheumatoid factor can potentially interfere with the assay and lead to spurious overestimation of the true circulating BLyS levels (Human Genome Sciences, Inc.; unpublished observations). To mitigate potential interference from rheumatoid factor, the BLyS ELISA has been modified and the capture anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody is now utilized as a Fab fragment. Despite the changes in the ELISA format, our findings are entirely consistent with those of the previous reports. Plasma BLyS levels were significantly greater in the SLE group than in either RA or normal control group (P < 0.001; Figure 1a). Arbitrary assignment of the 95th percentile value among the normal control individuals as the upper limit of 'normal' revealed that two of the 30 normal control individuals, 15 of the 60 RA patients, and 29 of the 60 SLE patients harbored elevated plasma BLyS levels (P < 0.001). Overexpression of BLyS in SLE patients was also established by measuring BLyS mRNA levels normalized to b-actin mRNA levels in peripheral blood leukocytes (buffy coats). The geometric mean full-length BLyS mRNA and DBLyS mRNA levels among the SLE patients were each significantly greater than those among the RA patients and normal control individuals, respectively (P < 0.001 for each; Figure 1b,c). Arbitrary assignment of the 95th percentile values for full-length BLyS and DBLyS mRNA levels among the normal control individuals as the upper limits of 'normal' revealed that two of the 30 normal control individuals, four of the 60 RA patients, and 20 of the 60 SLE patients had elevated full-length BLyS mRNA levels (P < 0.001), and that two of the 30 normal control individuals, three of the 60 RA patients, and 19 of the 60 SLE patients had elevated DBLyS mRNA levels (P < 0.001). Levels of full-length BLyS and DBLyS mRNA strongly correlated with each other (r = 0.703; P < 0.001) in the SLE cohort, and plasma BLyS levels also correlated significantly with levels of each BLyS isoform (r = 0.429, P < 0.001; and r = 0.290, P = 0.024, respectively). Among these SLE patients, none of the measured BLyS parameters correlated with patient age, sex, race, or daily dose of corticosteroids (data not shown). Because the racial composition of the normal cohort was not as predominantly Hispanic as were those of the RA and SLE cohorts, we assessed the BLyS parameters in the respective Hispanic subpopulations. As for the entire populations, values for SLE were significantly greater than those for either RA or normal controls (P < 0.004; data not shown). Correlations between BLyS parameters and plasma immunoglobulin levels BLyS is a potent B cell survival factor [15-21], and administration of exogenous BLyS to mice leads to B cell expansion and hypergammaglobulinemia [1]. Previous studies with numbers of SLE patients greater than were included in the present study documented a modest but significant correlation between serum levels of BLyS and IgG [8,10]. In our SLE cohort of limited size, plasma BLyS levels failed to show significant correlations with plasma levels of total immunoglobulin, IgG, or IgA. In contrast, full-length BLyS and DBLyS mRNA levels correlated significantly with each (Figure 2). (None of the BLyS parameters correlated with plasma IgM levels.) The absence of significant correlation between plasma BLyS levels and the immunoglobulin parameters also persisted when just the 53 patients with detectable plasma BLyS levels were considered (r = -0.133, P = 0.346 for total immunoglobulin; r = -0.048, P = 0.734 for IgG; and r = 0.033, P = 0.817 for IgA). Correlations between BLyS parameters and disease activity Previous studies either have failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between disease activity and circulating BLyS levels [7-9] or have detected only a weak correlation between the two [10]. Consonant with those studies, we identified no significant correlation between plasma BLyS levels and SLEDAI in our cohort of 60 SLE patients (Figure 3a). The failure to demonstrate a significant correlation cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because no significant correlation was detected among the 53 SLE patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range (r = 0.185, P = 0.183). In contrast, a significant correlation between SLEDAI and full-length BLyS mRNA levels was readily discernible (Figure 3b). A trend toward a correlation between SLEDAI and DBLyS mRNA levels was also observed, although it did not achieve statistical significance (Figure 3c). A component of the SLEDAI is the presence of circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies. Because circulating BLyS levels may affect the presence and/or titers of circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies [7-10], we assessed correlations between the individual BLyS parameters and a modified SLEDAI that excludes any consideration of anti-dsDNA antibodies. As with the unmodified SLEDAI, the modified SLEDAI did not correlate with plasma BLyS levels (Figure 3d) either among the SLE cohort overall or among the 53 patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range (r = 0.160, P = 0.252), but it significantly correlated with full-length BLyS mRNA levels (Figure 3e) and exhibited a trend toward correlation with DBLyS mRNA levels (Figure 3f). Thus, the stronger correlations between BLyS mRNA levels and disease activity cannot solely be explained by any effects that BLyS may have on anti-dsDNA antibodies per se. Moreover, among the 37 SLE patients who were evaluated on two separate occasions, trends toward correlation were appreciated between changes in the unmodified or modified SLEDAI and changes in full-length BLyS or DBLyS mRNA levels but not changes in plasma BLyS levels (Figure 4). These results cannot be ascribed to changes in medications taken by the patients, because changes in neither disease activity nor in any of the BLyS parameters correlated with changes in the doses of corticosteroids or cytotoxics taken by the patients (data not shown). The failure to demonstrate a meaningful association between changes in SLEDAI score and changes in plasma BLyS protein levels cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because the absence of association between the two persisted among the 27 SLE patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range in both samples (r = -0.069, P = 0.727 for plasma BLyS versus unmodified SLEDAI; r = -0.020, P = 0.919 for plasma BLyS versus modified SLEDAI). Lack of correlation between levels of BLyS mRNA isoforms and percentages of individual leukocyte cell types Among cells in peripheral blood, BLyS is predominantly expressed by cells of the myeloid lineage (monocytes and neutrophils) [1,14,22,23]. Accordingly, a shift in the differential leukocyte count away from lymphocytes to monocytes and/or neutrophils could substantially alter BLyS mRNA results. Because of the limited amount of blood we were permitted to obtain from the SLE patients (consequent to the high prevalence of anemia among these patients), we were unable to purify the individual leukocyte populations for BLyS mRNA analysis. Nevertheless, to demonstrate that the elevated BLyS mRNA levels in SLE did not simply reflect a shift in differential leukocyte count, we assessed the correlations between the individual BLyS parameters on the one hand and the percentages of blood neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes on the other. No correlations were appreciated (Figure 5). Presence of anti-BLyS autoantibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus The poorer correlation between plasma BLyS protein levels and disease activity compared with that between BLyS mRNA levels and disease activity was striking. Patients with SLE frequently develop autoantibodies against self-antigens, and so some of the SLE patients might have harbored autoantibodies to BLyS. Such autoantibodies could have complexed with BLyS and enhanced its clearance, thereby masking BLyS overproduction. Alternatively, such autoantibodies might have sterically blocked the epitopes recognized by the detecting antibodies in the in vitro ELISA. In this case, measured BLyS levels would have been spuriously reduced, again masking BLyS overproduction. In our cohort, IgA/IgM/IgG anti-BLyS antibodies were detected in six out of the 60 SLE patients. Such autoantibodies were also detected in two out of 60 RA patients and in one out of 30 normal control individuals, demonstrating that anti-BLyS autoantibodies are not restricted to SLE patients. IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies were detected in 3 SLE patients but in no RA patients or normal control individuals. Discussion Elevated blood levels of BLyS protein and mRNA are well described features of human SLE [7-9]. We confirmed these observations in our study and extended them by documenting increases not just in levels of full-length BLyS mRNA but also in levels of DBLyS mRNA (Figure 1). Of note, BLyS mRNA levels were elevated in SLE but not in RA, raising the possibility that BLyS overproduction in SLE is systemic whereas BLyS overproduction in RA may be more focused to the affected arthritic joints [24]. The modestly elevated plasma BLyS protein levels in RA patients may reflect, at least in part, release of locally overproduced BLyS into the circulation. The relationship between circulating BLyS protein levels and disease activity was addressed in several previous studies, but significant correlations between the two measures did not emerge [7-9]. In the largest study to date, a 2-year longitudinal study of 245 patients in which more than 1,700 plasma samples were analyzed, a significant but weak correlation between the two was appreciated [10]. In the present study, a significant correlation between plasma BLyS protein levels and disease activity was again not realized (Figure 3a,d). The weak, at best, correlation between circulating BLyS levels and disease activity is seemingly rather surprising. There is a clear-cut association in BlyS transgenic mice between BLyS overexpression and development of SLE-like features [3-5], and treatment of SLE-prone mice with BLyS antagonists retards the progression of disease and improves survival [3,6]. Moreover, development of precocious glomerular pathology in autoimmune-prone mice correlates strongly with circulating BLyS levels [25]. The likely explanation for the weak correlation between circulating BLyS levels and disease activity in human SLE is not that disease activity in SLE patients is insensitive to the degree of BLyS overproduction. Rather, a more tenable explanation is that circulating BLyS levels in human SLE do not always accurately reflect excessive endogenous BLyS production. We can identify at least three nonmutually exclusive mechanisms to explain a dissociation between the two. First, SLE patients frequently develop autoantibodies to a myriad of self-targets (for example, erythrocytes, lymphocytes). Indeed, we detected circulating IgA/IgM/IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies in 10% (6/60) of the tested SLE patients, and we detected circulating IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies in 5% (3/60). These percentages may be underestimates of the true prevalence of anti-BLyS autoantibodies, because some of these autoantibodies may be saturated in vivo with circulating BLyS, rendering them incapable of binding to BLyS in the in vitro detection assay. We do not yet know whether the anti-BLyS autoantibodies are functionally neutralizing but, regardless, such autoantibodies could enhance the clearance of BLyS and/or interfere with in vitro detection of BLyS, thereby masking endogenous BLyS overproduction. Second, increased urinary excretion of BLyS has been reported in SLE patients, especially among those with clinically overt renal involvement [26]. At least four of the patients we studied manifested nephrotic-range proteinuria (>3 g/24 hours), and so urinary loss of BLyS was probably substantial in at least these patients. A validated assay for urinary BLyS detection has not yet been developed so we were unable to quantify urinary BLyS levels. Once an assay for urinary BLyS levels is validated, we should be able to assess the effect of urinary BLyS excretion on circulating BLyS levels. Third, BLyS promotes in vivo expansion of B cells [1]. Freshly isolated SLE B cells, despite intact surface expression of BLyS receptors, bind less biotinylated BLyS ex vivo than do freshly isolated normal B cells [27]. Although other interpretations are possible, the most likely explanation is that BLyS receptors on B cells in SLE patients are occupied in vivo by soluble BLyS. Accordingly, it is likely that BLyS receptors expressed by the expanded B cell population do bind BLyS and remove it from the circulation, resulting in a homeostatic pathway that modulates the effects of BLyS overproduction on circulating BLyS levels. Indeed, circulating levels of BLyS rise with peripheral blood B cell depletion and fall with re-emergence of peripheral blood B cells in rituximab-treated RA or SLE patients [28,29], highlighting this inverse relationship between circulating BLyS levels and B cell load. Moreover, one of the hallmarks of active disease in human SLE is the increased percentages of activated B cells and plasma cells in peripheral blood [30-34], probably reflecting increased systemic numbers of activated B cells and plasma cells. Although not yet formally tested, differential BLyS receptor expression by these cells compared with expression by nonactivated B cells may result in increased peripheral BLyS utilization, further dampening the effects of BLyS overproduction on circulating protein levels. To circumvent these confounding processes, we used BLyS mRNA levels as a surrogate marker of endogenous BLyS production. Overall, the correlations between disease activity and either full-length BLyS or DBLyS mRNA levels were much stronger than that between disease activity and BLyS protein levels (Figures 3 and 4). This was the case regardless of whether we used the standard SLEDAI or the modified SLEDAI as a measure of disease activity. These correlations were not spurious ones consequent to shifts in percentages of leukocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood, because BLyS mRNA levels did not correlate with percentages of blood neutrophils, monocytes, or lymphocytes (Figure 5). A similar pattern was observed between plasma immunoglobulin levels and the BLyS parameters, with plasma levels of total immunoglobulin, IgG, and IgA correlating significantly with full-length BLyS and DBLyS mRNA levels but not with plasma BLyS levels (Figure 2). These significant correlations between full-length BLyS or DBLyS mRNA levels and plasma immunoglobulin levels again highlight the greater ability of BLyS mRNA levels, compared with plasma BLyS protein levels, to reflect ongoing BLyS overproduction. At present, it is not known whether soluble DBLyS protein is present in the circulation of SLE patients or of normal individuals. Although full-length BLyS protein is readily cleaved and released from cells transfected with a vector containing murine full-length BLyS, DBLyS protein is not cleaved or released from murine DBLyS transfectants [11]. Given the strong similarities between murine and human full-length BLyS and DBLyS, it is likely that human soluble DBLyS protein is also not cleaved from the cell surface and released into the circulation. Moreover, soluble DBLyS protein is not released from cells transfected with a vector containing just the extracellular domain of human DBLyS (which encodes the soluble protein; A.L. Gavin, unpublished observations). Whether this reflects rapid intracellular degradation of soluble DBLyS or some other impediment to its release remains unknown. Regardless, if the inability to release soluble DBLyS in vitro faithfully recapitulates in vivo biology, then the stronger associations between SLE disease activity and full-length BLyS or DBLyS mRNA levels compared with that between SLE disease activity and BLyS protein levels could not be attributable to interference by biologically inactive (inhibitory) DBLyS protein in the BLyS protein detection ELISA. Importantly, even if soluble DBLyS protein is present in the circulation and is detected by the BLyS protein detection ELISA, then the stronger correlations between SLE disease activity and full-length BLyS or DBLyS mRNA levels than that between disease activity and total BLyS (including DBLyS) protein levels suggest that full-length BLyS and/or DBLyS mRNA levels may operationally serve as useful biomarkers of disease activity in SLE. Although the complexity and labor intensiveness associated with quantitative real-time PCR may render measurement of BLyS mRNA levels impracticable for routine clinical practice, such measurement could readily be incorporated into clinical trials and yield valuable information. Longitudinal observations in large numbers of SLE patients will be necessary to establish or refute the utility of full-length BLyS and/or DBLyS mRNA to subserve this clinically vital function. Although expression of the two major BLyS isoforms was highly coordinate among SLE patients, there were several patients in whom DBLyS mRNA levels were markedly greater than or less than the expected values based on full-length BLyS mRNA levels (data not shown). This raises the possibility that dysregulation of DBLyS may contribute to overall BLyS dysregulation in at least some SLE patients. It is known that interferon-g, interleukin-10, interferon-a, and CD154 can upregulate full-length BLyS mRNA levels [14,22,35], but it is not known what effects these or other cytokines/cell-surface structures have on DBLyS expression. Further investigation of the regulation of DBLyS and the differential expression of BLyS isoforms is certainly warranted. Although the associations between full-length BLyS and/or DBLyS mRNA levels and disease activity in SLE were usually strong when the SLE cohort was analyzed in aggregate, there were several SLE patients in whom BLyS mRNA levels were quite high despite little objective ongoing disease activity, and there were several SLE patients in whom BLyS mRNA levels were low despite considerable ongoing disease activity. One must recognize that the bulk of the pathogenic autoimmune responses probably takes place in the spleen and lymph nodes, rather than in the peripheral blood, where myeloid lineage cells (for example, dendritic cells) produce BLyS and support B cell survival and expansion [36]. Local BLyS production in the secondary lymphoid tissues will be more important to the development and maintenance of an autoimmune response than will remote BLyS levels in the circulation. Because at least some autoreactive B cells may be more sensitive to BLyS-mediated survival signals than non-autoreactive B cells [37,38], local increases in BLyS production could preferentially promote expansion of autoreactive B cells. These cells, in turn, could activate autoreactive T cells by presenting autoantigen to them, and some of the autoreactive B cells would respond to T cell derived signals and mature into (pathogenic) autoantibody secreting plasma cells. In contrast to murine studies, in which investigators can readily harvest and analyze lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells from any site (for example, spleen, bone marrow), such is not the case for human studies. Peripheral blood is the only site readily accessible for human studies, and it is possible that, at least in some patients, BLyS mRNA levels in circulating leukocytes do not reflect local BLyS production in the secondary lymphoid tissues. One must also recognize that disease activity in SLE is not solely driven by B cells. Systemic inflammation and SLE flares can be triggered via B cell independent means. Not all SLE patients treated with a B cell depleting course of rituximab experience clinical remission [39], strongly pointing to the importance of non-B cells in disease pathogenesis/maintenance. Conversely, not all pathogenic B cells necessarily require high levels of BLyS to effect their pathogenicity. Murine studies have unequivocally documented B cell subpopulations that do not depend upon BLyS for their survival [40-42]. Although mice completely devoid of BLyS have reduced numbers of mature B cells and harbor reduced levels of immunoglobulin, these reductions are incomplete. Thus, it is possible that some SLE patients harbor pathogenic B cells that are relatively insensitive to BLyS and could drive considerable disease activity even in the context of low endogenous BLyS production. Conversely, patients with high BLyS mRNA levels may be those patients whose disease is strongly driven by BLyS and may be especially helped by BLyS antagonist therapy. Future clinical trials should be able to establish whether the BLyS mRNA levels are good predictors of response to such agents. Conclusion Plasma total immunoglobulin, IgG, and IgA levels and disease activity (as measured by SLEDAI) in SLE patients correlate more closely with peripheral blood leukocyte levels of BLyS mRNA than with plasma levels of BLyS protein. These findings suggest that BLyS mRNA levels better reflect in vivo BLyS production than do circulating BLyS protein levels, and may be a useful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE patients. These findings also support the premise that BLyS overexpression not only promotes development of disease but also actively contributes to the ongoing maintenance of disease in SLE patients. This reinforces the rationale underlying clinical trials with BLyS antagonists in SLE.

140144|t|Gender differences in factors influencing insulin resistance in elderly hyperlipemic non-diabetic subjects
140144|a|Abstract Background The increase in the prevalence of insulin resistance-related metabolic syndrome, a disorder that greatly increases the risk of diabetes, heart attack and stroke, is alarming. One of the most frequent and early symptoms of metabolic syndrome is hypertriglyceridemia. We examined the gender differences between various metabolic factors related to insulin resistance in elderly non-diabetic men and postmenopausal women of comparable age suffering from hypertriglyceridemia, and compared them with healthy subjects of equal age. Results The indexes of insulin resistance HOMA IR and QUICKI were significantly higher in both hyperlipemic men and women than in controls; 95% confidence limits of hyperlipemic subjects did not overlap with controls. In both normolipemic and hyperlipemic men and women serum leptin correlated significantly with insulin resistance, while HDL-cholesterol correlated inversely with HOMA-IR only in women (both normo- and hyperlipemic), and serum tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) only in hyperlipemic women. According to results of multiple regression analysis with HOMA-IR as a dependent variable, leptin played a significant role in determining insulin resistance in both genders, but - aside from leptin - triglycerides, TNFa and decreased HDL-cholesterol were significant determinants in women, while body mass index and decreased HDL-cholesterol were significant determinants in men. The coefficient of determination (R2) of HOMA IR by above mentioned metabolic variables was in women above 60%, in men only about 40%. Conclusion The significant role of serum leptin in determination of insulin resistance in both elderly men and postmenopausal women of equal age was confirmed. However, the study also revealed significant gender differences : in women a strong influence of triglycerides, TNFa and decreased HDL-cholesterol, in men only a mild role of BMI and decreased HDL-cholesterol. Background In association with pandemic obesity the prevalence of the insulin resistance-related metabolic syndrome is constantly growing [1]. As a consequence of this fact, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular mortality occurs in much younger age groups [2]. A typical hyperlipemia, consisting of an increase of serum triglycerides and a decrease of serum HDL-cholesterol, is a characteristic and an early symptom of this syndrome [3]. With increasing age, body mass index (BMI) and adiposity, insulin sensitivity declines and the number of cardiovascular risk factors increases in both genders [4-6]. It was repeatedly demonstrated that plasma concentration of leptin - a hormone produced mainly by adipose tissue - is substantially higher in all age groups of women than in men [7-10]. This may be caused by different size and/or distribution of fat tissue compartments influenced by hormones: estrogens stimulate, whereas testosterone inhibits leptin secretion. In women subcutaneous fat mass prevails - and during augmentation of overweight it increases - while in men intra-abdominal fat mass prevails [11-13]. Subcutaneous fat in particular serves as a substantial source of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), which represents one of the factors that interfere with insulin signal transduction into the cells [14-16]. Leptin, TNFa and some other factors are abundantly expressed in adipose tissue and contribute to the insulin resistance that accompanies overweight and obesity. Leptin correlates positively with hyperinsulinemia, BMI, fat mass and hypertriglyceridemia, respectively, and correlates inversely with HDL-cholesterol and lean body mass [17-25]. The incidence and mortality of ischemic heart disease and of other consequences of atherosclerosis increases with age in both genders, especially after the age of sixty. In premenopausal women, however, the incidence of these disorders is considerably less frequent than in men of appropriate age. After the menopause the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular mortality in women gradually increases, attaining values comparable to men at about the age of 70 [2,26]. Paradoxically, it takes place at the time when serum leptin concentration in women has relatively decreased [27,28]. The aim of this study was to analyze the interrelations between several metabolic variables and factors related to insulin resistance in groups of both normal and hyperlipemic postmenopausal women and men of appropriate age, and to attempt to elucidate the gender differences and some pathophysiologic mechanisms of these differences. We compared homeostatic indexes of insulin resistance HOMA IR and QUICKI, serum lipid and insulin parameters, uric acid, leptin and TNFa between groups of subjects without apparent symptoms of metabolic syndrome, and groups showing mild hypertriglyceridemia with decreased HDL-cholesterol. In addition, serum concentration of the heart fraction of fatty acid binding protein (hFATP) was explored as a factor that might reflect the regulative role of PPAR gamma in lipid homeostasis [29,30], and serum IgG anticardiolipin (ACL-IgG) was investigated as an indirect indicator of oxidized lipid fractions related to atherosclerotic complications [31,32]. Methods Subjects The study was carried out on 70 out-patients of the Metabolic Center at the hospital in Sternberk, Czech Republic. From these, 40 patients (20 men and 20 women) were selected with mild hyperlipidemia, i.e. with plasma triglyceride concentration exceeding 2.0 mmol/l, total cholesterol exceeding 6.0 mmol/l, LDL cholesterol exceeding 4.0 mmol/l, and with HDL cholesterol concentration in men under 1.0 mmol/l, and in women under 1.2 mmol/l. These groups were denominated as "hyperlipemic". Two other groups (10 men and 20 women) with approximately normal serum values of these variables were taken as "controls". The average age in men was 59.1 + 10.6 y, and in women 59.4 + 10.1 y, respectively. The differences between lipid parameters of hyperlipemic and control groups were highly statistically significant, while the age differences were insignificant (see Table 1). None of the patients had clinically apparent diabetes mellitus, but some of the hyperlipemic patients exerted impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose (values between 6.1 and 7.0 mmol/l, or between 6.1 and 7.8 mmol/l, respectively). None of the patients was treated with insulin, peroral antidiabetics or antihyperlipemic drugs; some of them were treated with antihypertensive therapy. No signs of major clinical or laboratory symptoms of other diseases were present in any group of the explored patients. Blood samples were obtained in the morning via a venipuncture after overnight fasting. After clotting the serum was separated and stored at -20o until used. An informed consent was obtained from all probands. Body mass indexes (BMI), defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters, were calculated. Biochemical methods Serum leptin concentrations were measured by a sandwich ELISA test kit (Human Leptin ELISA, BioVendor Laboratory Medicine, Inc, Czech Republic). Its sensitivity limit was 0.2 ng/ml, intraassay CV 6.1% at the level of 7.5 ng/m, inter-assay CV 8.5% at the level of 4.8 ng/ml. Tetramethylbenzidine was used as a substrate; quality controls were human based. Several other hormones and peptides were estimated by routine immunochemical tests: insulin, C-peptide, TNFa (IMMULITE, Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A.), proinsulin intact (DAKO, Denmark), IgG anticardiolipin (ACL-IgG, IMMCO Diagnostics, Buffalo, NY, U.S.A.) and heart fatty acid binding protein (hFABP, Hbt HUMAN H-FABP, HyCult Biotechnology, Uden, the Netherlands). Serum concentration of glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, Apoprotein B and uric acid were measured on a ILAB-600 biochemical analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, Ma, U.S.A.) using BioVendor sets. All samples were processed and examined according to principles of good laboratory practice and under constant intralaboratory and external quality control. The homeostatic indexes of insulin resistance (HOMA IR and QUICKI) were calculated according to the homeostasis model of assessment [33-35] as follows: HOMA IR = fasting insulin (uU/ml) * fasting glucose (mmol/l) / 22.5; QUICKI = 1 / [log fasting insulin (uU/ml) + log fasting glucose (mg/100 ml)]. Statistics Statistical analysis was performed using the Version 6 SAS/STAT software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, U.S.A.). The Shapiro-Wilks tests were used in testing the normality of distribution. Some of the data obtained were not normally distributed. The statistical significance of differences between the means in the hyperlipemic and control groups were evaluated using the unpaired Student's T-test in the case of normal distribution of data sets, and using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test when at least in one of the data sets the normal distribution was excluded. Spearman's rank-order correlation was used for correlation analysis. Multiple regression analysis was performed using HOMA IR indexes of insulin resistance as dependent variables, and other metabolic and hormonal factors (lipid parameters, BMI, leptin, TNFa, hFABP, ACL-IgG) as independent variables. The so-called step-down regression model was used to select dominant independent variables. Various four-member groups of independent (explanatory) variables were used for the analysis and the non-zero intercept was taken into account. The independent variables were then dropped, one at a time; at each stage one variable making the least contribution to the dependent variable (i.e. that showed the least p-value in the test of the regression coefficient being zero) was excluded. The coefficient of determination R2, which can be viewed as a percentage explaining the total variance, was simultaneously monitored. A great drop in R2 after excluding some independent variable enabled selection of those independent variables that could be thought to be the most important determinants of the dependent variable. Results Table 1 demonstrates mean parameters in individual groups of subjects matched according to sex, lipid parameters and age. While the age of all four groups did not differ substantially, the concentrations of total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol differ very significantly in both male and female hyperlipemic groups as compared with controls. In addition, the concentration of triglycerides in control women was significantly higher than in control men, the concentration of triglycerides in hyperlipemic women was lower than in hyperlipemic men, and the concentration of HDL-cholesterol in hyperlipemic women was very significantly higher when compared with hyperlipemic men. Table 2 shows the values of other metabolic and insulin parameters, factors related to insulin resistance and indexes of insulin resistance, respectively. Body mass indexes and uric acid concentration were significantly higher in hyperlipemic men as compared to controls, but not in hyperlipemic women. Uric acid concentration was substantially lower in hyperlipemic women than in hyperlipemic men. Plasma concentrations of glycemia, insulin and intact proinsulin were significantly higher in both hyperlipemic men and women as compared with controls of identical gender, while the concentration of leptin increased only in hyperlipemic men. However, serum leptin concentrations of both control and hyperlipemic women were significantly higher than in corresponding groups of men. Serum concentrations of TNFa, hFABP and ACL-IgG in hyperlipemic groups of both men and women were not significantly different from control groups. On the other hand, the indexes of insulin resistance HOMA IR and QUICKI differed very significantly in hyperlipemic groups of both men and women as compared with corresponding control groups, more distinctly in women. From Fig. 1, presenting 95% confidence limits of insulin resistance indexes HOMA IR and QUICKI, we concluded that in groups of hyperlipemic patients of both genders the insulin resistance was substantially higher than in control groups; the groups did not overlap each other. In Table 3 the results of Spearman's correlations between insulin resistance index HOMA IR and various metabolic parameters are presented. In the control group of men, positive significant correlation between HOMA IR and serum leptin concentration, and inverse significant correlation between HOMA IR and ACL IgG, respectively, were found. In the control group of women, the significance of Spearman's correlation between HOMA IR and leptin was more expressive; inverse correlation between HOMA IR and HDL-cholesterol was also present. In the hyperlipemic group of men, the significance of the correlation between HOMA IR was more expressive in relation to the control group, and no significant correlation between HOMA IR and ACL IgG was found. In the hyperlipemic group of women, however, the significance of Spearman's correlation between HOMA IR and serum leptin concentration weakened, the inverse correlation between HOMA IR and HDL-cholesterol remained approximately unchanged, and a positive correlation between HOMA IR and serum concentration of TNFa appeared. Table 4 shows results of multiple regression analysis, when data from both control and hyperlipemic groups of each gender were judged together. HOMA IR was considered as a dependent variable and differently changed constellations of metabolic and other factors were taken as independent variables. In men, BMI and leptin seemed to play a main role in influencing the insulin resistance index HOMA IR, while TGL, ACL IgG and LDL-cholesterol didn't play any significant role (see left columns of Table 4). The decreasing of HDL-cholesterol concentration may also have some influence (see a significant drop of R2 after exclusion of this factor in Table 4A, 4B). But in the presence of leptin in the group of independent factors, the drop of R2 after exclusion of HDL-cholesterol from these factors was minimal (see Table 4C). On the other hand, after the exclusion of TNFa from the group of independent variables (see Table 4B, 4D) the value of R2 has unexpectedly risen, which could reflect the interference of TNFa with factors increasing the insulin resistance. In women (see right columns of Table 4), the maximal values of R2 were achieved with combination of independent variables containing TGL, leptin and HDL-cholesterol (about 60% influence on HOMA IR! - see Table 4A, 4B, 4C). TNFa seemed to play quite a different role than in men: after exclusion of this factor from the group of independent factors R2significantly decreased (see Table 4B, 4D). In contrast to men, the role of BMI seemed to be minimal. As in men, the role of ACL IgG and LDL-cholesterol in influencing HOMA IR was negligible, but in contrast to men, hFABP might play a certain role in this process (see Table 4D). Generally, the insulin resistance (represented by HOMA IR) was in men much less influenced by metabolic variables than in women; while in women in some combinations of dependent variables R2 reached 64 %, in men the maximal value of R2 was only 39 %. Discussion In our previous paper [36], the mean value of HOMA IR in healthy subjects of both genders and of age comparable with our controls was 1.57 + 0.87, and the mean value of index QUICKI 0.366 + 0.029, respectively. These values, as well as the 95 % confidence limits, correspond to values found in controls in this study. In accordance with many previous papers, serum concentrations of leptin in women (both control and hyperlipemic) were substantially higher than in men. In the control group of women the correlation between leptin and HOMA IR was highly significant. However, in hyperlipemic women the significance of this correlation lessened, because HOMA IR increased considerably (and significantly) but serum concentration of leptin only slightly (insignificantly). In men the significance of correlations between serum leptin and HOMA IR was high and approximately the same in both the control and hyperlipemic groups, because the values of HOMA IR as well as serum leptin have nearly doubled in hyperlipemic in relation to control groups. In non-hyperlipemic postmenopausal women the high concentration of serum leptin was not associated with higher insulin resistance: HOMA IR did not differ substantially from men. A significant increase of insulin resistance in hyperlipemic women was associated by only slight and insignificant increase of leptin concentration. According to Spearman's correlations, an increase of serum TNFa and/or a decrease of HDL-cholesterol might also play a distinct role in this respect. (see Table 3). In contrast to women, in hyperlipemic men the increase of insulin resistance index was approximately proportional with the increase of leptin concentration. Multiple regression analysis affirmed the importance of leptin serum in increasing of insulin resistance in both genders. In men, only BMI and HDL-cholesterol from other factors studied seemed to play a certain role, but the maximal values of influencing HOMA IR reached only 39%, with leptin and BMI being the more important factors. On the other hand, in women the maximal determination of HOMA IR as high as 60% was registered in combination of serum leptin, TGL and decreased HDL-cholesterol as independent factors; the role of BMI was insignificant. It is not known how leptin is regulated. A strong correlation between plasma leptin and fasting insulin undoubtedly exists, but hyperleptinemia in both obese and lean humans is not likely the result of hyperinsulinemia [37]. A relationship between leptin and insulin dependent on sex or BMI was reported, but relationship between triglyceride concentrations and leptin was independent of sex, BMI, and insulin [18,24]. Hyperleptinemia, as an early sign of obesity, was closely linked to subcutaneous fat mass [39,40]. Percentage of body fat has been shown to be the strongest predictor of leptin levels even in lean women [41]. Leptin was highly correlated with percentage of body fat and with fat mass in adults irrespective of gender and age; however, the mean determinant of leptin plasma concentration in men and postmenopausal women was BMI, while in premenopausal women it was only the fat mass [42]. These findings contrast with our results showing minimal influence of BMI on HOMA IR in postmenopausal women. All factors mentioned are connected with fat tissue: leptin and TNFa are directly produced chiefly by adipocytes, BMI growth is obviously accompanied by fat mass increase, and the typical hypertriglyceridemia associated with a decrease of HDL-cholesterol goes along with obesity and fat mass growth. The gender differences in circulating leptin were best explained by percentage of body fat and - inversely - by lean body mass [25]. In both genders the intra-abdominal fat correlated with insulin resistance, while the subcutaneous fat correlated with circulating leptin [11,12]. In men obesity led to a prevalent increase of intra-abdominal fat, while in women of subcutaneous fat [13]. Influences of different compartments of adipose tissues could elucidate the variability of correlations between insulin resistance and high leptin concentrations in lean and obese subjects of both genders [43]. In our non-hyperlipemic postmenopausal women the content of subcutaneous fat mass might be higher than in non-hyperlipemic men of appropriate age, which indicated a higher serum concentration of leptin. However, the insulin resistance - related to intra-abdominal fat mass - did not differ from men. The significant increase of insulin resistance and leptin concentration in hyperlipemic men might reflect the growing content of both subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat mass (see the significant increase of BMI). In hyperlipemic women the significant increase of insulin resistance accompanying only minimal insignificant increase of leptin could be caused by prevalent growing of intra-abdominal fat mass. In elderly postmenopausal women, an association between leptin and plasma lipoprotein concentration was found which depended on adiposity [17], and inverse correlations between serum leptin and HDL-cholesterol were described [44]. In our study, insulin resistance in women seemed to be more notably than in men influenced by lipid disorders, i.e. positively by serum triglycerides and inversely by HDL-cholesterol. These findings might be important in considering the concept of treatment of insulin resistance-related disorders in postmenopausal women. The significant role of TNFa in insulin resistance, caused by inhibiting the transduction of insulin signaling and by down-regulation of glucose transporter GLUT-4 and insulin receptor substrate-1, has been repeatedly confirmed [45-48]. Our results supported these findings unambiguously only in women, while in men TNFa seemed paradoxically to interfere with other factors - mainly BMI and leptin - in influencing insulin resistance, thus playing a quite different role. Previously it was found [46] that correlation between serum TNFa on the one side, and insulin, HOMA IR, serum triglycerids, respectively, on the other side, was substantially more significant in women than in men. Serum concentration of TNFa in patients with type 2 diabetes of both genders correlated only with the quantity of intra-abdominal fat compartment [50]. Visceral obesity correlated with plasmatic aldosterone and with insulin resistance only in premenopausal women, but not in men [51]. From all these data we might support our above mentioned conclusion - that rising of insulin resistance in hyperlipemic women was associated with an increase of intra-abdominal fat, because this fat mass in particular is a source of TNFa, which interfered with insulin sensitivity only in women. We came to this conclusion irrespective of the finding that the increase of serum TNFa in hyperlipemic women was statistically insignificant; results of Spearman's correlation (Table 3) and multiple regression analysis confirm a distinct role of this factor. In hyperlipemic men not only the serum concentration of TNFa has decreased instead of increasing, but according to multiple regression analysis it played a quite different role in influencing insulin sensitivity, interfering with factors that determined insulin resistance (leptin and BMI). In the control group of men IgG anticardiolipin was inversely correlated to HOMA IR. The significance of this finding is not clear. These antibodies indicate vascular and thrombotic complications and oxidative modification of lipoproteins [52,53] and may represent an increased risk of atherogenic and inflammatory complications. In this case, however, their growing might be connected with an increase in insulin sensitivity. Anyway, ACL IgG evidently did not participate significantly in influencing the increase of insulin resistance associated with hyperlipidemia, although other anti-cardiolipin correlations could be masked by the relatively large inter-individual variations in this parameter. Neither serum concentration of hFABP, a factor ensuring transmembrane transport and oxidative metabolisation of long-chain fatty acids [54,55], was significantly changed in hyperlipemic and insulin resistant subjects of both genders. This factor was very weakly associated only with HOMA IR in women (see Table 4D), indicating that enhanced metabolisation of fatty acids in cells might to some degree contribute to insulin resistance. Conclusions In postmenopausal women as well as in men of approximately equal age serum leptin plays a significant role as an important determinant of insulin resistance. In addition to this factor, in women the grade of insulin resistance is very considerably influenced by serum triglycerides, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and by decreased concentration of HDL-cholesterol, while in men only a mild influence of BMI and decreased HDL-cholesterol is observed. These findings are explained as a consequence of gender-related differences in adipose tissue composition and/or distribution in both normal-weight and over-weight subjects and should be taken into account in treatment of patients with metabolic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases.

This method eliminates purification, cloning and analysis of each individual AluPCR product before library screening. A series of human X chromosome irradiation hybrids were mapped by this method, using a cosmid reference library for comparisons between overlapping hybrids to identify interesting clones for further analysis. INTRODUCTION The generation of human DNA probes specific for individual chromosomes and subregions of chromosomes has been advanced with Alu-sequence primed polymerase chain reaction amplification (Alu-PCR, 1-3). This method specifically amplifies sequences between Alu repeats from human DNA in somatic cell hybrids and yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs, 4). Individual Alu-PCR products can be purified from agarose gels or ligated into plasmid vectors to screen for single copy sequences. Unique Alu-PCR products are then localized to certain chromosome regions using DNA blots of somatic cell hybrid panels. Once localized, Alu-PCR fragments can be screened against genomic libraries to isolate longer DNA fragments from the region of interest. As an alternative to this multistep process we have developed a hybridization protocol for screening of cosmid and YAC libraries directly with pools of Alu-PCR products. Two new human specific Alu primers were used to generate DNA probes from a series of irradiation-reduced hybrids containing multiple human X chromosome fragments of 1-2000 kb on a hamster chromosome background (5; P.N.G., unpublished). The Alu-PCR products were hybridized as a pool of probes to X-specific cosmid and YAC libraries, after competitive reassociation with an excess of human DNA to both the library filters and radioactively labelled Alu-PCR products. Comparisons were made between clones identified by overlapping irradiation hybrids and single copy DNA probes hybridized to the cosmid and YAC libraries. METHODS Two human Alu sequence primers were generated which were shown to be human specific; 3144 from the 3' end of Alu: 5'-GAGCGAGACTCCGTCTCAAA-3' and 2729 from the 5' end of Alu: 5'-GTGGATCACCTGAGGTCAGGAGTTC-3'. All PCR reactions were carried out with 100 ng of hybrid DNA and 0.7 ,^g of a single Alu primer in 100 d41 of 0.01 M Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 0.0015 M MgCl2, 0.05 M KCI, 200 AtM each of dNTPs, 10% dimethlysulfoxide, and 2.5 units of Cetus Taq polymerase. Reactions were 30 cycles of 94?C for 2 min, 57?C for 2 min, and 74?C for 4 min followed by a final extension time at 74?C for 9 min. Reactions products were analyzed on 1 % agarose gels and shown to contain between five and twenty fragments, with sizes ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 kb. Chinese hamster DNA and no DNA PCR reactions were done to control for non-human products (data not shown). Alu-PCR products were separated from Alu oligomers over Qiagen columns, and approximately 50-100 ng were labelled by random hexamer priming (6). The radioactively labelled pool of fragments was prehybridized with 37.5 ,^g of total human DNA and 12.5 tsg of hamster DNA immobilized on a cellulose support matrix, prepared as previously described (7). Reactions were at 65?C in 1 ml of 0.75M NaCl, 0.05M sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 0.005M EDTA, 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 0.5 mg/ml heparin, and 100 jig/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The cellulose was pelleted and the supernatant boiled for 2 min every 12-16 hours (three times in two days). Cosmid and YAC library filters (Hybond N+, Amersham) were prehybridized at 42?C for 16 hours with 100 jig/ml * To whom correspondence should be addressed at Human Genetics Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK 1991 Oxford University Press 3316 Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 19, No. 12 Chromosome X .,.., ., < _ ., . < ., *2.' 1- 7-_ _-_ 1.

The radioactively labelled Alu-PCR products were denatured and added to fresh hybridization solution without human DNA competitor at 1 x 106 cpm/ml and hybridized at 42?C for 16 hours. Filters were washed in 0.1 xSSC and 1.0% SDS, twice at room temperature and twice at 65?C for 30 min each and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film for 2-3 days at -70?C with an intensifying screen. For each hybridization, two sets of duplicate cosmid filters were used from the ICRF reference library system (8), each containing 9216 flow-sorted human X chromosome cosmid clones or approximately 2 chromosome equivalents on a 22 x 22 cm filter (9). The coordinates of signals positive on duplicate cosmid filters were entered into the reference library database (G. Z, unpublished) using a digitizing tablet. For the X chromosome specific YAC library (A.P.M. and H.L., unpublished), about 420 YAC colonies were spotted manually onto filters from 96 well microtiter dishes using a 96 prong device. After growth on selective media for 3 days, YAC filters were processed for hybridization as previously described (10). RESULTS A panel of 195 X chromosome irradiation hybrids was constructed (50,000 rads) and characterized by DNA hybridization using 27 X chromosome markers and flourescence in situ hybridization using total human DNA as probe (Benham et al., 1989; P.N.G., unpublished). This analysis indicated that the hybrids contained multiple small fragments (4-10 fragments of 1000-5000 kb each) with a preferential retaining of centromere sequences (90%). From this panel, nine irradiation hybrids were chosen that contained less than five different regions by DNA probe hybridizations, mostly from the short arm of the X chromosome (Fig 1). All nine hybrids were used in PCR reactions with 3'-Alu primer 3144 and two were used with 5'-Alu Figure 3: Hybridization of Alu-PCR products generated with Alu primer 3144 from irradiation hybrid 54 to a filter containing 420 YAC clones from the human X chromosome. The positive YAC was also identified in a separate hybridization with the DMD probe P20 (12). primer 2729. Example hybridizations to a human X chromosome cosmid filter in Fig 2 shows the intensity and reliability of positive clones identified on duplicate filters with Alu-PCR products from the same irradiation hybrid (48) and the independence of clones identified with Alu-PCR products from a different hybrid (54). Fig 3 shows a single positive YAC clone after hybridization of Alu-PCR products from irradiation hybrid 54 to a filter containing about 420 YAC clones specific for the human X chromosome. The total number of cosmids identified with each pool of AluPCR products for each hybrid is shown in Table 1. From the average number of cosmids identified (24) in four chromosome equivalents screened and the estimated average DNA content in each hybrid (3000-15000 kb), the Alu-PCR products generated by a single primer were calculated on average to be 300-1500 kb apart, similar to published estimates for this method (1,2). Only 3-4 cosmids were identified in common using Alu-PCR products generated with either 3' or 5' Alu primers (3144 or 2729) from two hybrids (38 and 45). This shows that separate products were amplified with the two Alu primers since they prime synthesis from opposite ends of the Alu consensus sequence and Alu sequences are oriented in the genome either head to head, A B C El I0 Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 19, No. 12 3317 Table 1.

Therefore, by using the 3'- and 5'-Alu primers in separate PCR reactions with the same hybrid DNA, the total number of products and cosmid clones identified was almost doubled. Table 1 also indicates how many cosmids were identified by Alu-PCR products from other hybrids, and 16 cosmids previously identified with unique DNA probes in the reference library database. As can be seen in Fig 1 and previous irradiation hybrid analysis, there is a preferential retention of centromere sequences (2,11). However, there were no cosmids identified in common from all the hybrids positive with centromere sequences. This is probably due to a paucity of Alu repeats in the correct orientation in alphoid centromere sequences and thus few or no Alu-PCR products would be amplified from the centromere. Cosmids identified in common by several irradiation hybrids (Table 1) were most likely from regions of overlap outside the centromere area as shown by the previous DNA probe characterization (Fig 1). The overlap regions between hybrids were also seen by 16 cosmids (Table 1, Fig 1) that were hybridization targets of unique DNA markers in the reference library database that mapped in independent experiments to the overlap region. At least for several cosmids this showed that the Alu-PCR products identified target cosmids that were definitely from the expected region contained in the hybrids. For example, hybrids 21 and 54 were both shown to contain part of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) locus (Fig 1; P.N.G., unpublished) and had 11 cosmids in common, including one identified by the probe P20 from the deletion hotspot region of the DMD gene (12). In Fig 3 the hybridization of Alu-PCR products from hybrid 54 identified a YAC clone which was also positive for the DMD probe P20 (data not shown). This method also identified fragments in the hybrids that were not seen in the initial DNA characterization (Fig 1 and Table 1). Since the 27 DNA probes were not close enough to each other along the chromosome to detect all possible hybrid fragments (1000-5000 kb), many regions would have been untested. For example, AluPCR products from hybrids 45 and 48 identified several cosmids, also seen by the cDNA for chronic granulomatous disease gene (CYBB, 13) in Xp2 1.1, although this region was not tested in the original hybrid characterization. DISCUSSION The direct hybridization of Alu-PCR products from somatic cell hybrids to genomic libraries can bypass gel purification or ligation of fragments into plasmid vectors and individual analysis for single copy sequences. Hybridization of Alu-PCR products as a pool to ordered array libraries such as the flow-sorted X chromosome cosmid library (9), allows the direct comparison of overlapping hybrids to pinpoint cosmids most likely to be from the region of interest. In conjunction with the reference library database (G.Z, unpublished) with 183 X chromosome probe hybridization entries, cosmids identified with both Alu-PCR products and uniquely mapped X probes immediately map them to the region of interest and proove that the method has worked. Similar hybridization experiments using Alu-PCR products from four overlapping irradiation hybrids identified four cosmids in common that mapped to the region of overlap by independent experiments (F.Muscatelli, A.P.M., P.N.G., H.L. and M.Fontes, in preparation). Since only 27 probes from the X chromosome were used to initially characterize the hybrids and the length of individual human fragments in the irradiation hybrids is about 1000-5000 kb, many regions could have been undetected in the original analysis. The direct hybridization of Alu-PCR products to the cosmid reference library detected such fragments since they identified cosmids in common with uniquely mapped probes in regions not tested originally (Table 1 and Fig 1). This should prove to be a sensitive and efficient method to determine content and overlap of irradiation hybrids in conjunction with DNA blot hybridization. However, since the exact length of the human DNA fragments for each hybrid and the spacing of Alu-PCR products along the chromosome is not known, it is difficult to directly correlate the number of target cosmids to the DNA content of the hybrids. The direct hybridization of Alu-PCR products from irradiation or somatic cell hybrids to total genomic YAC libraries will be especially useful to construct long range YAC contigs from specific subregions of chromosomes. The dissection of a total genomic YAC library by this method may be more efficient than generating chromosome specific YAC libraries from somatic cell hybrids (usually a haploid human chromosome on a diploid or greater rodent background) or flow-sorted chromosomes, because of the low transformation efficiency of yeast.

1885664|t|The recombination-associated protein RdgC adopts a novel toroidal architecture for DNA binding
1885664|a|Abstract RecA plays a central role in the nonmutagenic repair of stalled replication forks in bacteria. RdgC, a recombination-associated DNA-binding protein, is a potential negative regulator of RecA function. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of RdgC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The J-shaped monomer has a unique fold and can be divided into three structural domains: tip domain, center domain and base domain. Two such monomers dimerize to form a ring-shaped molecule of approximate 2-fold symmetry. Of the two inter-subunit interfaces within the dimer, one interface (   interface A   ) between tip/center domains is more nonpolar than the other (   interface B   ) between base domains. The structure allows us to propose that the RdgC dimer binds dsDNA through the central hole of  30 A diameter. The proposed model is supported by our DNA-binding assays coupled with mutagenesis, which indicate that the conserved positively charged residues on the protein surface around the central hole play important roles in DNA binding. The novel ring-shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer has significant implications for its role in homologous recombination. INTRODUCTION Homologous recombination systems contribute to the maintenance of genome integrity and are essential for the repair of stalled replication forks (1). Genetic studies of the recombination-dependent growth C (rdgC) gene in bacterial systems have suggested that it is involved in DNA replication and recombination (2,3). In Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the gonococcus), RdgC is required for efficient pilin antigenic variation and plays some role in cell growth (4,5). The Escherichia coli rdgC gene encodes a DNA-binding protein of 34 kDa, whose expression level was at its highest during exponential phase, reaching its maximum at  1000 dimers per cell (2). Its level decreased sharply to  50 dimers per cell in stationary phase. This profile suggests that RdgC might function during the period of DNA replication (2). The RecA proteins and their homologs play a key role in recombinational DNA repair in bacteria and eukaryotes. Their aberrant reactions could result in gross chromosomal rearrangements that lead to human diseases, including cancer. Therefore, their functions must be tightly regulated, and understanding how the RecA family of recombinases is regulated is of utmost importance (1). The E. coli RdgC protein is a potential negative regulator of the function of RecA (1). It inhibits RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange, RecA-mediated ATPase activity and RecA-dependent LexA cleavage (1). Sedimentation equilibrium data indicated that E. coli RdgC exists in solution as a mixture of oligomeric states in equilibrium, most likely monomers, dimers and tetramers (1). This concentration-dependent change in the oligomeric state appears to affect its mode of binding to DNA and its capacity to inhibit RecA (1). The primary mechanism of RdgC inhibition appears to involve a simple competition for DNA-binding sites, especially on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (1). Deletion of the E. coli rdgC gene alone causes no obvious phenotype but is highly deleterious in strains lacking certain enzymes involved in recombination and replication restart (2,3). RdgC is essential for the growth of an E. coli strain lacking PriA, indicating that it might affect replication fork progression or fork rescue (2). PriA provides a means to load the DnaB replicative helicase at DNA replication fork and D loop structures (2). RdgC is, therefore, a key factor in the rescue of stalled or broken forks and subsequent replication restart. dnaC suppressors of PriA can overcome this inviability, especially when RecF, RecO or RecR is inactivated, which indicates that RdgC avoids or counters the toxic effect of these proteins by limiting inappropriate RecA loading on SSB-coated ssDNA (2). The DNA-binding ability of the RdgC protein has been demonstrated clearly using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (2). Escherichia coli RdgC binds non-specifically to dsDNA and with higher affinity than ssDNA (2). RdgC from N. meningitidis also binds DNA with little specificity for sequence or structure, like the E. coli protein (4). RdgC exhibits no preference for DNA replication or recombination intermediates (2). However, no detectable domains or nuclease activity could be identified for the E. coli RdgC protein (2,6). The complexes of E. coli RdgC with both linear and supercoiled circular plasmid DNA were imaged using atomic force microscopy (7). RdgC was found to have an increased affinity to DNA ends and to promote bending of DNA (7). RdgC has the effect on DNA superstructure; the promotion of DNA condensation was observed at high protein concentrations (7). Recombination is largely enhanced by close contacts of distant regions along the DNA strands through condensation (7). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental Gram-negative bacterium that belongs to the g subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Orthologs of the rdgC gene are found only in b and g subdivisions of the Proteobacteria (2). The amino acid sequence of P. aeruginosa RdgC, a 306-residue protein, shows 46 and 36% identities against those of E. coli and N. meningitidis, respectively. Despite the importance of DNA-binding ability of RdgC in its biological roles, the structural details of RdgC and the mechanism of its action remain unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of P. aeruginosa RdgC as determined by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method of X-ray crystallography. It reveals that RdgC dimer is ring-shaped, with a central hole of  30 A diameter. The inside surface around the central hole is rich in conserved, positively charged residues, which are implicated in DNA-binding by mutagenesis. We propose that dsDNA binds to RdgC through this central hole. Our structure provides a solid structural framework for a better understanding of the role of RdgC in homologous recombination. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein expression and purification The rdgC gene (PA3263) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the genomic DNA of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 as a template. The oligonucleotide primers designed using the published genome sequence (8) were 5   -G GAA TTC CAT ATG TGG TTC CGC AAT CTG CTC G-3    (forward) and 5   -CCG CCG CTC GAG GAC GCC CTG GGG GAT TTC TTC-3    (reverse). The bases in bold denote the NdeI and XhoI cleavage sites, respectively. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI, and was then inserted into the NdeI/XhoI-digested expression vector pET-21a(+) (Novagen). This vector construction adds an eight-residue tag (LEHHHHHH) to the carboxyl terminus of the gene product to facilitate protein purification. The protein was expressed in E. coli C41 (DE3) cells (9). The cells were grown at 37oC up to OD600 of 0.6 in Luria-Bertani medium that contained 50 ug ml   1 ampicillin, and the protein expression was induced by 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells were allowed to grow at 20oC for 22 h after IPTG induction and were harvested by centrifugation at 4200 g (6000 rev min   1; Sorvall GSA rotor) for 10 min at 4oC. The cell pellet was resuspended in an ice-cold lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM imidazole] and was then homogenized with an ultrasonic processor. The crude cell extract was centrifuged at 36 000 g (18 000 rev min   1; Hanil Supra 21 K rotor) for 60 min at 4oC, and the recombinant protein in the supernatant fraction was purified in three chromatographic steps. The first purification step utilized the C-terminal hexahistidine-tag by Ni2+-chelated HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare). The eluent was diluted 3-fold with 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4. The diluted solution was applied to a 20-ml heparin-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), which was previously equilibrated with a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EDTA. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-2.0 M sodium chloride in the same buffer. The first peak corresponded to high molecular aggregates of RdgC and the second peak to RdgC dimers, which was also consistent with our dynamic light scattering measurements. When the aggregates were not separated from the dimers, the protein readily aggregated within a day. The dimer fractions were concentrated to  6 mg ml   1 concentration using an YM10 ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore-Amicon) and further purified by gel filtration on a HiLoad XK 16 Superdex 200 prep-grade column (GE Healthcare), which was previously equilibrated with a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EDTA. The first peak corresponding to the high molecular aggregates of RdgC was only a minor component, and the second peak corresponding to RdgC dimers was stable for several weeks when frozen at    70oC. The procedure for purifying the SeMet-substituted protein was the same, except for the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol in all buffers used during purification steps. Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed at 24oC, with the protein (at 2 mg ml   1 concentration) dissolved in a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA and 200 mM sodium chloride on a Model DynaPro-801 instrument (Wyatt, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The protein concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, employing the calculated extinction coefficient of 20 910 M   1 cm   1 (SWISS-PROT; http://www.expasy.ch/). Mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay Point mutants were prepared using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The seven mutants R4A, F120A, K146A, R198A, R208A, Q212A and R252A were well expressed and soluble. The three mutants K70A, R81A and R211A were not expressed, while R122A mutant was expressed but was not soluble. Therefore, we mutated Lys70, Arg81, Arg122 and Arg211 into aspartate. The K70D, R81D, R122D and R211D mutants were well expressed and soluble. The soluble mutants were expressed and purified under the conditions identical to those for the wild type, except that the heparin-Sepharose column step was omitted. All of the soluble mutants had similar elution profiles as the wild type upon gel filtration, and the dimer fractions were used for DNA-binding assays. We mixed 5 ul of RdgC (1.1 ug ul   1) and 5 ul of a linear dsDNA with 414 bp (63 ng ul   1), corresponding to the molar ratio of 64:1 for RdgC dimer to dsDNA. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. RdgC-DNA complexes were analyzed by 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis in 1x TAE buffer (45 mM Tris-acetate at pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA). DNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. For DNA-binding assays, the protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Crystallization and X-ray data collection Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 24oC by mixing equal volumes (2 ul each) of the protein solution (at 19 mg ml   1 concentration in a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA and 200 mM sodium chloride) and the reservoir solution. To grow the native crystals, we used a reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 M sodium HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.0 M tri-sodium citrate and 1% (w/v) AnapoeR35 as the detergent. Native crystals grew to approximate dimensions of 0.2 mm x 0.1 mm x 0.1 mm within a few days. The SeMet-substituted protein was crystallized under conditions identical to those for the native crystals except for the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol in the protein solution. A crystal of the SeMet-substituted protein was dipped into a cryoprotectant solution for a few seconds and was flash-cooled in the cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. The cryoprotectant solution consisted of 0.1 M sodium HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.0 M tri-sodium citrate, 1% (w/v) AnapoeR35 as the detergent and 10% (v/v) glycerol. A set of Se MAD data was collected at 100 K at three different wavelengths using an Area Detector System Corporation Quantum 210 charge-coupled device detector at the beamline NW12A of Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. The crystal was rotated through a total of 180o with a 1o oscillation range per frame. The raw data were processed and scaled using the program suit HKL2000 (10). The SeMet-substituted crystal belongs to the space group P21212, with unit cell parameters of a = 87.04 A, b = 115.60 A and c = 76.07 A. The native crystals were soaked for 10 min in 10 mM ethyl mercury thiosalicylate (EMTS) to collect a set of Hg MAD data at four different wavelengths. X-ray diffraction data from the EMTS-derivatized crystal, as well as a native crystal, were collected on a Bruker charge-coupled device detector at the beamline BL-6B of Pohang Light Source, Pohang, Korea. The EMTS-soaked crystal belongs to the space group P21212, with unit cell parameters of a = 87.16 A, b = 116.02 A and c = 74.97 A. The native crystal belongs to the space group P21212, with unit cell parameters of a = 87.49 A, b = 116.04 A and c = 76.03 A. If the presence of a dimeric molecule in the asymmetric unit is assumed, the calculated crystal volume per protein mass (VM) is 2.75 A3 Da   1 and the solvent content is 55.3%. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the statistics of X-ray diffraction data collection. Structure solution and refinement Heavy atom sites were located with the program SOLVE (11). Four Se sites from the SeMet-substituted crystal and two Hg sites from the EMTS-soaked crystal were located. Two sets of the initial Se and Hg MAD phases were separately improved using the program RESOLVE (12). Two electron density maps were independently interpreted, and the fragments of the two models were combined into a single model, since the two maps were complementary to each other. Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) matrices were found from a partial model built from the initial electron density map, and phases were further improved by the 2-fold NCS averaging, solvent flattening and histogram matching with the program DM (13). The model was built with O (14). The model was refined with the program CNS (15), including the bulk solvent correction. 10% of the data were randomly set aside as the test data for the calculation of Rfree (16). Several rounds of model building, simulated annealing, positional refinement and individual B-factor refinement were performed. Subsequently, this model was used to refine the structure of the native protein. The model has excellent stereochemistry, as evaluated by the program PROCHECK (17). Refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Model quality and monomer structure The structure of P. aeruginosa RdgC was solved using two sets of MAD data collected from a crystal of the selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein and from a mercury derivative crystal of the native protein (Supplementary Table 1). The model has subsequently been refined using the 20.0-2.50 A data from a native crystal to crystallographic Rwork and Rfree values of 23.4 and 27.9%, respectively, with no sigma cut-off. The refined model contains 612 residues of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit of the crystal (residues 1-306 for both chains A and B) and 87 water molecules. The C-terminal eight-residue fusion tag has no electron density in both subunits and has not been modeled. Conformations of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit are similar. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) difference between the two monomers is 0.69 A for 306 Ca atom pairs, with a maximum deviation of 8.8 A for the Ca atom of Gly305. The residues giving r.m.s. differences larger than 2.0 A are 14-16, 94-96, 201-202 and 303-306, which correspond to loops connecting secondary structure elements or the C-terminus. They are located on the surface of the dimer. Subunit A has a better map quality than subunit B, and thus has a lower mean B-factor than subunit B (40.3 A2 versus. 56.1 A2 for all 4788 atoms) (Supplementary Figure 1). Therefore, subunit A is chosen for discussions, unless otherwise stated. The P. aeruginosa RdgC monomer is J-shaped and has approximate dimensions of 72 A x 60 A x 40 A (Figure 1). It can be divided into three structural domains: center domain, tip domain and base domain. Center domain (residues 1-73 and 121-167) includes a six-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet with two flanking a helices (a1 and a4). The helix a1 runs nearly parallel to the two outermost strands b2 and b3, which in turn lie adjacent to b4. Strands b2 and b3 are separated by a loop. The helix a4 is nearly orthogonal to the b-strands. Tip domain (residues 74-120) contains two a helices (a2 and a3) and is inserted between strands b4 and b5 of the center domain. It sticks out from the center domain. The two connections between the center domain and the tip domain are rich in conserved residues, hinting at an important functional role of these joints. They could act as a hinge for a possible conformational change. The C-terminal region of the polypeptide chain is folded into the base domain (residues 168-306), which consists of a five-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet with four a-helices, three of which (a5, a6 and a8) cover one side of the b-sheet. The long helix a8 is slightly bent. Structural similarity searches When we searched for structural similarity against the Protein Data Bank database using the program DALI (18), the P. aeruginosa RdgC monomer showed no significant similarity with a Z score above 5. Therefore, we conclude that the overall fold of the RdgC polypeptide chain is unique. When we elaborated the structural comparisons with individual domains of P. aeruginosa RdgC, only the center domain gave a Z score above 5. Using the center domain (residues 1-73 and 121-167) alone, the highest structural similarity is found with the human b2-adaptin appendage domain (PDB code 1E42, Z score = 7.1, r.m.s. deviation = 2.5 A for 85 structurally aligned residues, residues 1-12, 14-30, 44-47, 58-72, 122-133 and 135-160 of P. aeruginosa RdgC chain A and residues 838-841, 848-880, 885-906 and 912-967 of the human b2-adaptin appendage domain chain A) (19). There does not appear to be any functional relatedness between these two proteins. The next highest similarity is found with the yeast TATA-box-binding protein (PDB code 1YTB, Z score = 5.7, r.m.s. deviation = 2.6 A for 79 structurally aligned residues, residues 4-12, 14-19, 21-27, 56-70, 124-132 and 134-166 of P. aeruginosa RdgC chain A and residues 69-96, 100-126 and 132-155 of TATA-box-binding protein, N-terminal half of chain A) (20). The TATA-box-binding protein is composed of a ten-stranded antiparallel b-sheet with four flanking a-helices on the convex side of the b-sheet (20). It has an internal quasi 2-fold symmetry, and its b-strands are involved in DNA binding. There is, however, no structural similarity of functional significance, because the two center domains of the RdgC dimer are well separated and do not associate into a single unit (Figure 1C and D). Using the tip domain (residues 74-120) alone, the ATPase domain of bovine Hsc70 chaperone shows highest structural similarity (PDB code 1BA1, Z score = 4.8, r.m.s. deviation = 1.7 A for 45 structurally aligned residues, residues 76-120 of P. aeruginosa RdgC chain A and residues 230-253 and 256-276 of the Hsc70 ATPase domain) (21). There does not seem to be any significant functional relationship between these two proteins. The a-helix-loop-a-helix structure of the tip domain is reminiscent of the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) DNA-binding motif that is present in a number of DNA repair enzymes (22-25). The HhH motifs are characterized by the conserved sequence motif hxxhxGhGxxxAxxxhh, where h is any hydrophobic residue (VILMWFYA) and x any residue (23). Two conserved glycines allow a tight turn between two a-helices. However, the tip domain of P. aeruginosa RdgC protein does not have such a sequence motif, and the loop in the RdgC tip domain is much more extended than that of the HhH motifs. Therefore, the RdgC tip domain is uniquely folded. With the base domain (residues 168-306) alone, the highest similarity is found with P. aeruginosa isochorismate-pyruvate lyase (unpublished deposition; PDB code 2H9C, Z score = 4.0, r.m.s. deviation = 4.8 A for 51 structurally aligned residues, residues 186-191, 237-240, 257-272 and 274-298 of P. aeruginosa RdgC chain A and residues 36-41, 50-53, 55-66 and 68-96 of P. aeruginosa isochorismate-pyruvate lyase chain A). There does not appear to be any functional relationship between the two proteins, and the base domain of RdgC is uniquely folded. The 101-residue chain of P. aeruginosa isochorismate-pyruvate lyase is folded into three a-helices, two of which overlap with two a-helices (a2 and a3) of the base domain of RdgC. Ring-shaped dimer structure and inter-subunit interface Our structure reveals that P. aeruginosa RdgC forms a ring-shaped dimer of approximate 2-fold symmetry in the crystal (Figure 1). This observation is consistent with the results of previous gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium experiments, which suggested the presence of dimeric species of E. coli RdgC in solution (1,2). Depending on the concentration, RdgC could also exist in solution as monomers, tetramers and higher oligomers (1). In the crystal lattice, no monomeric, trimeric or tetrameric species exist. Our structure unequivocally rules out the monomer-trimer model, which fits the sedimentation equilibrium data approximately, as well as the monomer-dimer-tetramer model (1). The RdgC dimer has approximate dimensions of 80 A x 60 A x 40 A, with a central hole of  30 A diameter. Only a moderate amount of surface area is buried upon the formation of the RdgC dimer. The monomer-monomer interface buries a solvent-accessible surface area of  1360 A2 per monomer, corresponding to  8% of the total surface area of the monomer (Protein-Protein Interaction Server at http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server/). Polar and nonpolar atoms in interface are 44 and 56%, respectively. The interface can be divided into two kinds:    interface A    involving both the tip domains and center domains, and    interface B    involving the base domains (Figure 2A). These two interfaces have significantly different characters. The interface A is formed largely by the crossing over of the two tip domains in the dimer (Figure 1). This interface covers a surface area of  565 A2 and is largely nonpolar, with the polar and nonpolar atoms in the interface being 37.5 and 2.5%, respectively. Phe120 contributes considerably to the nonpolar character of the interface between the tip domains, accounting for  150 A2 of the interface area. Phe120 is part of a highly conserved sequence segment and lies at the boundary between the tip domain and the center domain. The aromatic ring of Phe120    inserts into a hydrophobic pocket, which is formed by the hydrophobic residues Ile74, Leu75, Pro76, Val79, Leu115, Ala119 and Phe120 of the neighboring monomer (Figure 2B). The primed residue belongs to the adjacent subunit. These residues are well conserved in the RdgC family (indicated by green triangles below the aligned sequences in Figure 3). As these hydrophobic residues are located near the molecular 2-fold axis, the two clusters of hydrophobic side chains are merged into a single, large cluster in the dimer (Figure 2B). Of the 16 hydrogen bonds that exist between the two subunits, only one is made in this interface between Arg118 and Arg118   . The interface B is contributed to exclusively by the two base domains. This interface covers a surface area of  795 A2. The polar and nonpolar atoms in this interface are 50% each. The two b-sheets of the two base domains merge into a single ten-stranded antiparallel b-sheet in this interface (Figure 2A). Thus, 15 of 16 inter-subunit hydrogen bonds are clustered in this interface. The hydrogen bond networks can be divided into two types. The first type involves the main chain atoms of Val206, Arg208 and Lys210 in strand b9; this strand associates with the equivalent strand from the other subunit in an antiparallel manner (Figure 2C). The other type involves both the side chain and main chain atoms. The side chain of Arg211    interacts with the backbone of Gly204, while the side chain of Lys227 hydrogen bonds to those of both Gln212    and Glu218 (Figure 2D). In addition, the side chain of Gln212    interacts with that of Asp199 and the backbone of Arg211    (Figure 2D). Arg211, Gln212, Glu218 and Lys227 are highly conserved among the RdgC family members. The residues participating in the hydrogen bond networks are indicated by red circles below the aligned sequences in Figure 3. The observation that conserved residues play important roles in forming the dimer implies that dimerization of RdgC is critical for its function. If one or both of interfaces A and B are to be broken for functional reasons such as for allowing dsDNA to enter into the central hole of the RdgC dimer, we can conceive of three scenarios. The first possibility would be a simultaneous breakage of the two interfaces A and B. The second would be the sequential disruption of the interfaces A and B. The third would be the disruption of only one of the two interfaces A and B. Sedimentation equilibrium indicated the presence of monomers in solution (1), which is consistent with the first two scenarios. If the third scenario holds, RdgC dimers could possibly exist in two conformations in solution, i.e. a closed form as observed in the present crystal structure, and an open form, in which one of the two interfaces A and B is broken. A model for DNA binding by RdgC and DNA-binding assay The net charge of P. aeruginosa RdgC is highly negative, since each monomer contains 12 aspartate, 13 glutamate, 10 lysine, 9 arginine and 2 histidine residues. The net charge of a dimer would be    12 (or    8), if we assume none (or all) of histidines to be positively charged. The electrostatic potential at the molecular surface of RdgC dimer shows that the charge distribution on the protein surface is highly nonuniform (Figure 4A). Since the inner surface of the RdgC dimer is rich in conserved, positively charged residues and the diameter of the central hole ( 30 A) is approximately similar to that of other toroidal DNA-binding proteins (26), it appears likely that RdgC dimers bind dsDNA through the central hole. Despite extensive co-crystallization and soaking trials with linear dsDNAs of different lengths (14-mer, 16-mer and 18-mer), we could not locate the bound DNA experimentally. We attribute this difficulty to the nature of sequence-nonspecific DNA binding by RdgC. Therefore, we built a crude model of a DNA complex of the RdgC dimer by fitting dsDNA into the central hole (Figure 4B). This model is supported by the DNA-binding assays coupled with mutagenesis, as described below. It is also consistent with the suggested binding site size of  16 nt for the E. coli RdgC dimer (1) and the approximate thickness ( 40 A) of the P. aeruginosa RdgC dimer. When we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay for dsDNA binding, P. aeruginosa RdgC did not require Mg2+ ions (Supplementary Figure 2), unlike Deinococcus radiodurans RecR, which required high concentrations of Mg2+ ions (27). ATP was not required for dsDNA binding by P. aeruginosa RdgC, either (Supplementary Figure 2). This is consistent with an apparent lack of an ATP-binding pocket in the RdgC dimer structure. In order to identify the residues that are important for dsDNA binding, we carried out mutational analyses. The residues for mutagenesis were selected on the basis of the modeled complex between RdgC dimer and dsDNA, together with sequence conservation (Figure 4C). We prepared eleven point mutants (R4A, K70D, R81D, F120A, R122D, K146A, R198A, R208A, R211D, Q212A and R252A). These eleven mutated residues are well conserved among RdgC proteins. Eight mutants (R4A, K70D, R81D, R122D, K146A, R198A, R208A and R252A) had a lower affinity for dsDNA than the wild-type RdgC (Figure 4D). These eight mutated residues are indicated by blue squares below the aligned sequences in Figure 3. This result indicates that dsDNA binds to the inside surface around the central hole of the RdgC dimer, since the mutated residues are located on the inner surface of the RdgC dimer. It is worth mentioning that a single mutation introduces two alterations per RdgC dimer. The three mutants (F120A, R211D and Q212A) were prepared to investigate whether dimerization of RdgC is crucial for dsDNA binding. Phe120 is a key residue located in the inter-subunit interface A (Figure 2B), while Arg211 makes hydrogen bonds in the interface B (Figure 2D) and Gln212 is involved in both intra- and inter-subunit interactions (Figure 2D). dsDNA binding by the F120A mutant is considerably weakened, compared to either the R211D or Q212A mutant (Figure 4D). This result suggests that destabilization of the ring-shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer is deleterious for tight dsDNA binding and that interface A is probably more important than interface B for dsDNA binding. dsDNA-binding affinity of the Q212A mutant was lower than the wild type (Figure 4D), whereas that of the R211D mutant was comparable to the wild type (Figure 4D). This result suggests that disruption of the inter-subunit interface B is also detrimental for dsDNA binding but to a smaller extent than disruption of the interface A. It further suggests that the side chain of Arg211 is not involved in recognizing dsDNA. It is interesting that the DNA complex for wild type forms a distinct band (lane 3 in Figure 4D), as opposed to a more diffuse band as one would expect if the complexes contained different numbers of RdgC dimers. Assuming a binding site size of  16 nt (1), the 414-bp duplex DNA would bind  25 RdgC dimers if it is fully saturated. RdgC is unique among ring-shaped DNA-binding proteins Pseudomonas aeruginosa RdgC adds a unique member to the repertoire of toroidal DNA-binding proteins (26) such as D. radiodurans RecR (27) and DNA polymerase processivity factors, including the b subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III (28), gp45 of T4 DNA polymerase (29) and PCNA of eukaryotic DNA polymerase d (30,31) (Figure 5). These proteins do not have an overall sequence similarity among themselves, and their quaternary structures also vary. P. aeruginosa RdgC and E. coli b clamp are homodimers, T4 gp45 and eukaryotic PCNAs are homotrimers and D. radiodurans RecR is a homotetramer. In P. aeruginosa RdgC, the inner surface of the ring-shaped dimer is largely formed by b-strands, while the outer surface of the ring is mostly formed by a-helices (Figure 5). The predicted DNA-binding site of P. aeruginosa RdgC dimer is primarily formed by b-strands and loops. In contrast, in other ring-shaped DNA-binding proteins such as the b subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III (28), gp45 of T4 DNA polymerase (29), PCNA of eukaryotic DNA polymerases d (30,31) and D. radiodurans RecR (27), a-helices are located toward the center of the ring and are surrounded by b-strands in the outermost side of the ring (Figure 5). Despite a superficial resemblance of the overall ring-shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer with those of other toroidal DNA-binding proteins, the internal arrangement of the secondary structure elements in the RdgC dimer is strikingly different from those of other toroidal DNA-binding proteins. Thus, RdgC is unique among ring-shaped DNA-binding proteins. A number of other proteins involved in DNA metabolism also adopt a ring-shaped structure despite diversity in the molecular functions (26). They include NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (25), r exonuclease (32), hexameric helicases, topoisomerases, the trp RNA-binding attenuation protein, the bacteriophage head-to-tail connector and translin (26). There are also many examples of the proteins in DNA recombination pathways that assemble into multi-subunit toroids containing a central channel (26). Electron microscopy showed that the E. coli RuvB protein, in the presence of ATP, forms a dodecamer on double-stranded DNA in which two stacked hexameric rings encircle the DNA and are oriented in opposite directions with D6 symmetry (33). The human RAD52 protein was found to assemble into heptameric rings with a large funnel-shaped channel, 40-60 A in diameter (34). The human DMC1 protein has so far been detected only as an octameric ring (35). Inhibition mechanism of RecA function by RdgC RdgC inhibits RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange, RecA-mediated ATPase activity and RecA-dependent LexA cleavage (1). It was observed that the effects of RdgC on RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange were much more pronounced than the effects of RdgC on other RecA functions, when RdgC was added to the reaction late (1). By examining the effects of the DinI protein on RdgC-mediated inhibition of RecA activities, it was concluded that the potent effect of RdgC in the inhibition of strand exchange did not primarily reflect a displacement of RecA in the nucleoprotein filament by RdgC, but instead a binding of RdgC to the dsDNA substrate so as to make it unavailable to the filaments for strand exchange (1). Our work contributes to a better understanding of the inhibition mechanism of RecA function by RdgC. The ring-shaped architecture with a central hole that is suitable for the binding of dsDNA lends RdgC with a capacity to hold dsDNA very tightly. Therefore, we suggest that RdgC dimers probably function as a tight dsDNA gripper and physically block access to the target dsDNA by RecA filaments, because tight encircling of dsDNA by RdgC dimers, possibly as a linear aggregate, would prevent the two strands from dissociating. However, it remains unclear how the closed-ring structure of the RdgC dimer might allow binding of a large number of RdgC dimers on the duplex DNA. It may be conceivable that each RdgC dimer can open temporarily at one or both of its two inter-subunit interfaces so that dsDNA can enter the central hole. RdgC was at its highest level during exponential phase, reaching its maximum of  1000 dimers per E. coli cell. Its level decreased sharply to  50 dimers per cell in stationary phase (2). Under normal cellular conditions, RecA is maintained at  1000 molecules per cell (http://www.els.net/). Following LexA repressor cleavage, the level of RecA protein in the cell increases by as much as 20-fold. RdgC inhibition of the RecA function by a simple competition mechanism at the cellular concentration of RdgC clearly requires a much higher affinity for DNA by RdgC than RecA. Possible protein-protein interactions between RdgC dimers might have a profound effect on the affinity for DNA, when a large number of RdgC dimers are bound on a duplex DNA. If only one of the two inter-subunit interfaces can open up and the 2-fold symmetry axes of the RdgC dimers are misaligned sufficiently, the escape of DNA from a linear array of interacting RdgC dimers would be extremely difficult. Alternatively, both inter-subunit interfaces of each dimer may open up simultaneously. A line of indirect evidence for the possible protein-protein interactions between RdgC dimers is provided by the cooperative binding of RdgC to DNA (7). Cooperativity of RdgC binding may be caused by local and distant protein-protein interactions (7). A kind of side-by-side interaction between two adjacent molecules of RdgC dimer is present in the crystal, burying an accessible surface area of  750 A2 at the interface. The interaction involves mostly the less polar side surface of the dimer (left side of Figure 4A), with 2-fold symmetry axes of the two interacting RdgC molecules making an angle of  90o when viewed down the central holes and  15o when viewed perpendicular to the holes. This may explain the observed DNA bending by RdgC, which was speculated to be a necessary step in the working mechanism of RdgC, if one can assume that the strong protein-protein interactions in the crystal were relevant for protein-protein interactions in solution (7). RdgC protein was shown to have a potent effect on RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange in E. coli (1). In a series of experiments, RdgC was added after RecA filaments had formed on the ssDNA and 5 min after the linear dsDNA was added. With 3 uM RecA, a sharp reduction in DNA strand exchange products was seen with 0.4 uM RdgC, and the generation of products was abolished at 0.8 uM RdgC (1). This suggests that the binding affinity of RdgC to dsDNA is considerably higher than that of RecA. The high affinity of RdgC could be explained by its ring shape and the suggested mode of DNA binding. Tetrameric species of E. coli RdgC, which started to form at around 2 uM concentrations, were speculated to be the species with the most potent inhibitory effect, possibly by having a higher affinity for DNA (1). Higher affinity for DNA of the tetrameric species could be understood, if the formation of a tetramer in solution involves a protein-protein interaction similar to the side-by-side interaction between two adjacent RdgC dimers in the crystal, although there is no experimental evidence. Obviously, there are still many open questions that need to be addressed in future biochemical experiments. SUMMARY The crystal structure of RdgC, a recombination-associated DNA-binding protein, determined in this study reveals that the polypeptide chain is uniquely folded and two monomers associate to form a ring-shaped dimer with a central hole of  30 A diameter. The inner surface around the central hole is rich in positively charged residues. These structural features suggest that dsDNA runs through the central hole when it binds to RdgC dimers. This idea is supported by our mutational studies, which indicate that the conserved, positively charged residues around the central hole are important for dsDNA binding. The toroidal architecture of the RdgC dimer provides a sound framework for a better understanding of its role in homologous recombination.

INTRODUCTION Oligonucleoside methylphosphonates have been used to st-udy the function of specific RNA sequences in biochemical and intact cellular systems (1,2). Since these nonionic nucleic acid analogs can be taken up intact by mammalian cells and certain bacterial cells in culture, these compounds promise to be useful reagents for exploring and regulating the function of nucleic acids within living cells. In order to carry out more extensive biochemical and biological studies, an efficient method for synthesis of oligonucleoside methylphosphonates of defined sequence is needed. Previously we described the synthesis of methylphosphonate analogs on a silica gel support (3). Protected nucleoside 3'-methylphosphonic chlorides or tetrazolides were used as synthetic intermediates. While oligothymidine methylphosphonates could be efficiently synthesized by this procedure, low yields were encountered when other nucleosides, particularly d-[(MeO)2Tr]ibuG were used. Recently Sinha et al. ?) I RL Press Limited, Oxford, England. Nucleic Acids Research Volume 1 1 Number 18 1983 6225 Nucleic Acids Research described the preparation of oligonucleoside methylphosphophonates on a glass support using nucleoside 3'-methylphosphine chlorides as reactive intermediates (4). In this paper we describe a set of useful methods for the synthesis and analysis of these analogs. The synthesis involves condensation of protected nucleoside 3'-methylphosphonate triethylammonium salts with nucleosides or oligomers linked to a polystyrene support. This method has proven to be easy to use and allows relatively rapid synthesis of oligomers of defined sequence up to nine nucleosides in length. We have also developed conditions for the efficient removal of base protecting groups and subsequent purification of the oligomers. A novel hydrolysis reaction which can be used as a basis for characterizing and sequencing these oligonucleotide analogs occurs at apurinic sites created by acid treatment of the oligomers. EXPERIMENTAL Materials and Methods Protected nucleosides, d-[(MeO)2Tr]N, were purchased from P.L. Biochemicals and were used without further purification. Protected nucleoside 3'-methylphosphonate triethylammoni um salts, d-[(MeO)2Tr]Np*Et3NH, were prepared as previously described (3). 5-Dimethoxytrityl protected nucleosides esterified to 1% or 2% crosslinked polystyrene were purchased from Chem Genes Inc. The nucleoside loading level was 40 to 120 pmol of nucleoside/g of support. Mesitylenesulfonyl-3-nitrotriazole (MSNT) was purchased from Vega Biochemicals. Anhydrous pyridine was prepared by refluxing previously purified pyridine (5) over calcium hydride chips for several hours followed by distillation onto calcium hydride chips in 5 ml V-vials fitted with Teflon-lined septum caps (Wheaton Scientific). Lyophilized spleen phosphodiesterase was obtained from P.L. Biochemicals. T-4 polynucleotide kinase and [y-32P]-ATP were obtained from New England Nuclear. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out on Whatman Inc. C-18 (ODS-3) columns (0.4 x 25 cm). Analytical columns were eluted with 50 ml linear gradients of acetonitrile in water or acetonitrile in 0.1 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.8) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The eluate was monitored at 254 nm. The following molar extinction coefficients were used at 254 nm: d-T 7,250, dA 13,270, dC 6,260, dG 13,700. Unless otherwise noted, all reactions and operations were carried out at room temperature. General Procedure for Preparing Oligonucleoside Methylphosphonates. The following procedure represents the current method used in our laboratory to 6226 Nucleic Acids Research synthesize methylphosphonate oligomers. Table I lists some of the oligomers which have been synthesized on polystyrene supports. Oligomers 7, 8, and 10 were synthesized as described below. The other oligomers were synthesized in essentially the same manner except the condensation reactions were run in 1 ml V-vials or in glass reaction columns purchased from Bachem Inc. When the reactions were run in V-vials, the support was dried by several evaporations with anhydrous pyridine in the V-vial (3). When the reactions were run in the glass reaction column, the support was dried by a single evaporation with anhydrous pyridine overnight at room temperature. Synthesis of Protected Oligonucleoside Methylphosphonates. The synthetic reactions are most conveniently carried out in a polypropylene col umn (Bio Rad Econo column) fitted with a Teflon 3-way valve (Bio Rad) and a rubber septum cap (Wheaton Scientific). During washing operations, the septum cap is removed and the 3-way valve is connected to a filter flask via a Luerer adaptor and tubing set (Bio Rad). Generally vacuum is not required to wash the support. During the drying step, one port of the 3-way valve is connected to a cold trap and vacuum pump via the barrel of a 1 ml plastic syringe. The other port is connected to a Drierite column filled with dry argon. A reaction cycle consists of the following 10 steps: 1) The support (60 mg, 1% crosslinked) in the column is washed with three 2 ml portions of methylene chloride/isopropanol (85:15, v/v). 2) The support is treated with 2 ml of 1 M zinc bromide in methylene chloride/isopropanol solution. Two fiveminute treatments are used when the support-bound nucleoside is d-[(MeO)2Tr]bzA or d-[(MeO)2Tr]ibuG, while four treatments are used when the nucleoside is d-[(MeO)2Tr]T or d-[(MeO)2Tr]bzC. After each treatment the orange solution is collected in a clean flask. 3) The support is washed with two 2 ml portions of methylene chloride/isopropanol and the washings are collected in same flask used in step 2). The solution is diluted to 50 ml and a 0.20 ml aliquot is dissolved in 0.80 ml of perchloric acid/ethanol (3:2, v/v). The absorbance is determined at 500 nm and the amount of trityl cation is determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 89,000. 4) The column is attached to a waste flask and the support is washed with three 2 ml portions of 0.5 M triethylammonium acetate in dimethylformamide; three 2 ml portions of anhydrous pyridine and three 2 ml portions of diethyl ether. 5) The column is fitted with the septum cap and set up in the drying mode under house vacuum for at least 5 min. 6) The support is dried by adding 300 jl of anhydrous pyridine via a gas tight syringe (Hamilton). After the support has swollen, the vacuum (oil pump) is applied and the support is warmed with a 6227 Nucleic Acids Research stream of air from a hair dryer. Evaporation is continued for 10 min. Dry argon is then admitted and the drying operation is repeated two more times. 7) The coupling mixture is prepared by dissolving 0.20 mmol of MSNT in 320 pl of anhydrous pyridine. The solution is then transferred to the vial containing 0.06 mmol of d-[(MeO)2Tr]Np-Et3NH. The nucleotide is dissolved by vortexing and the coupling solution is then added dropwise to the support. It is important to add the solution slowly and to allow the support to swell. Trapped gas bubbles may be removed by gently tapping the column. This entire operation is carried out using one predried syringe. The syringe is left in the V-vial while the reagents are being dissolved. 8) The reaction mixture is kept at room temperature for two hrs. 9) The column is set up in the washing mode and the support is washed with three 2 ml portions of anhydrous pyridine. The solution, which contains unreacted nucleoside 3'-methylphosphonate and MSNT, is collected in a separate flask. A 50% aqueous pyridine solution (1 ml) is added and the solution is kept at 40C for later purification and recovery of d-[(MeO)2Tr]Np. 10) The support is treated with a solution containing 2 ml of anhydrous pyridine, 1 ml of acetic anhydride and 20 mg of dimethylaminopyridine for 30 min. (This step was not included for the synthesis of oligomer 10). 11) Return to step 1, for the next cycle. Removal of Base Protecting Groups. The following general procedure was found to be the most effective method for cleaving the oligonucleotide from the 1% crosslinked support and for removing the base protecting groups with minimal hydrolysis of the phosphonate backbone. The following steps were used for deprotecting oligomers 7, 8 and 10. Oligomer 9 was deprotected in a similar fashion except step 4) was carried out at 650C for 3 hrs. For oligomers 1-6, step 3) was not included and step 4) was carried out at 650 for 3 hrs. 1) After the final condensation step the support (60 mg) is washed with three 2 ml portions of anhydrous pyridine; three 2 ml portions of methylene chloride/isopropanol and three 2 ml portions of diethyl ether. The support is then dried under house vacuum. 2) The support is swollen by addition of 2 ml of pyridine and the excess is removed under house vacuum. 3) The support is treated with 3 ml of 0.017 M tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran/pyridine/water (8:1:1, v/v) for 40 hrs at room temperature. No shaking is required. The support is then washed with three 2 ml portions of 50% pyridine/water; three 2 ml portions of pyridine; and three 2 ml portions of methylene chloride/isopropanol. 4) The support is treated with 3 ml of ethylenediamine/ethanol (1:1, v/v) for 7 hrs at room temperature 6228 Nucleic Acids Research without shaking. The solution is collected and the support is washed with four 2 ml portions of pyridine/ethanol (1:1, v/v) and four 2 ml portions of N,N-dimethylformamide. The combined eluate and washings are evaporated at 250C and the oily residue is co-evaporated several time with 50% aqueous ethanol. Purification of Oligonucleoside Methylphosphonates. For oligomers which contain only methylphosphonate linkages (1-6), the residue from step 4) of the previous section is dissolved in a small volume of 50% aqueous ethanol. The solution is chromatographed on a C-18 reversed phase column (0.46 cm x 25 cm for 100 A254 units or less; 0.9 cm x 50 cm for more than 100 A254 units) using a linear gradient of 0% to 25% (8-mer or less) or 0% to 35% (9 mer) acetonitrile in water to remove non-tritylated oligomers. The desired tritylated oligomer is eluted with 50% acetonitrile in water. The solvents are evaporated and the residue is treated with 1 ml of 80% acetic acid in water for 1 hr at room temperature. The solvents are evaporated and the residue is repeatedly evaporated with ethanol to ensure complete removal of acetic acid. The oligomer is then purified by C-18 reversed phase HPLC using a 0% to 25% or 30% acetonitrile in water gradient. For oligomers which terminate with a 5'-nucleoside phosphodiester linkage (7-10) the residue from step 4) described in the preceeding section is treated with 80% acetic acid in water for 15 min at room temperature. After removal of the acetic acid by evaporation, the residue is dissolved in 20 ml of 50% aqueous ethanol and the solution is passed through a DEAE cellulose column (2.5 x 8 cm, bicarbonate form) which has been previously washed with 50% aqueous ethanol. The column is monitored at 254 nm and washed with 50% aqueous ethanol until the pen returns to the baseline. The desired oligomer is then eluted with 0.15 M triethylammonium bicarbonate in 50% aqueous ethanol. The buffer is removed by evaporation and co-evaporated with 50% aqueous ethanol. The oligomer is then further purified by C-18 reversed phase HPLC using a 0% to 30% acetonitrile in 0.10 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.8) gradient. The oligomer is freed of ammonium acetate by desalting on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (1.5 x 20 cm). Removal of the 5'-Terminal Nucleotide Unit. Oligomers which terminate with a 5'-nucleotide phosphodiester may be converted to the oligonucleoside methylphosphonate by the following procedure. The oligomer (3 A254 units) is dissolved in 40 pl of water and treated at 370C for 2 hrs with 10 PI (1-2 units) of spleen phosphodiesterase dissolved in water. The completeness of the reaction is determined by reversed phase HPLC. The solution is then 6229 Nucleic Acids Research diluted with 50 ul of water and passed through a DEAE cellulose column (0.5 x 1 cm). The column is washed with 500 Pl of water and the oligomer is recovered by lyophilization. Recovery of Protected Nucleoside 3'-Methylphosphonates. The aqueous pyridine solution from step 9) described in General Procedure for Preparing Oligonucleoside Methylphosphonates, is evaporated after addition of 0.1 ml of triethylamine. The residue is dissolved in 50 ml of chloroform and the solution is extracted twice with 50 ml of 1 M ammonium bicarbonate. The chloroform layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Several drops of triethylamine are added to clarify the solution. After filtration the solvents are evaporated and the residue is evaporated with three 2 ml portions of anhydrous pyridine on an oil pump. The foamy residue is dissolved in 2 ml of dry methylene chloride and the solution is added dropwise to a stirred solution of 1% triethylamine in hexane. The resulting precipitate is collected via filtration on a sintered glass filter, washed with hexane and dried in a vacuum desiccator. Removal of Base Protecting Groups with Ethylenediamine. Several mg of d-I[(MeO)2Tr]bzA, d-[(MeO)2Tr]bzC and d-[(MeO)2Tr]ibu G were each dissolved in 250 pl of ethylenediamine/ethanol (1:1,v/v). The solutions were incubated at room temperature. At various times aliquots were chromatographed on silica gel TLC plates which were eluted with 10% methanol in chloroform. The spots corresponding to the starting material and the product were cut out and treated with 1.5 ml of perchloric acid/ethanol (3:2, v/v) for 30 min. The absorbance of each solution was measured at 500 nm and the percent reaction was determined. The half-lives of the reactions are given in Table II. Removal of Protected- Nucleosides from Polystyrene Support. Five mg of d-[(MeO)2Tr]T(ED(1% crosslinked), d-[(MeO)2Tr]bzA O?(1% crosslinked), d-[(MeO)2Tr]bzC(?)(1% and 2% crosslinked) and d-[(MeO)2Tr]ibuGcD(1% and 2% crosslinked) were each treated with 500 ul of ethylenediamine/ethanol (1:1, v/v) solution at room temperature. At various times, 10 pl aliquots were removed, the solvent was evaporated and the residue was dissolved in 1 ml of perchloric acid/ethanol solution (3:2, v/v). The amount of dimethoxytrityl cation and hence the amount of nucleoside cleaved from the support was determined by measuring the absorbance at 500 nm. The half lives of the cleavage reactions are given in Table II. Hydrolysis of the Methylphosphonate Linkage by Ethylenediamine. Oligonucleoside methylphosphonates (1.25 A254 units each) were treated with 50 il of ethylenediamine/ethanol (1:1, v/v) at room temperature. Aliquots 6230 Nucleic Acids Research (10 pl) were withdrawn at various times and the solvents were evaporated. The residue was dissolved in 20 PI of 50% aqueous ethanol and the solution examined by C-18 reversed phase HPLC using a 0% to 25% acetonitrile in water gradient. The mole percent of starting oligomer remaining after 100 hrs of treatment is given in Table III. Hydrolysis of Oligonucleoside Methylphosphonates in Acid. Six A254 units of oligomer were dissolved in 100 pl of 0.01 M hydrochloric acid solution. The solution was heated at either 450 or 650C. Aliquots (10 Pil) were withdrawn at various times and added to 10 pl of 0.015 M ammonium hydroxide at 0?C. The samples were then injected directly onto a C-18 reversed phase column which was eluted with 50 ml of a linear gradient of 0% to 25% acetonitrile in water at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The products of the reaction were determined by comparison with authentic samples. Labeling 5'-End of Oligonucleoside Methylphosphonates with T4-Polynucleotide Kinase. Oligonucleoside methylphosphonates (2 nmol) were dissolved in a buffer solution containing 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 9.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 20 pM spermidine, and [y-32P]ATP (8 ljCi, 4Ci/mmol). T4-polynucleotide kinase (4 units) was added to the solution, which was made up to 50 ul by adding water. The solutions were incubated at 370C for 2 hrs. The reaction was checked by PEI-cellulose TLC. The PEI-cellulose plate (12x2Ocm, Merck) was preactivated by elution with 1.2 M pyridinium formate (pH 3.5). Small aliquots (0.1 pl) of PNK reaction solutions were applied and developed with 1.5 M pyridinium formate (pH 3.5). The TLC plate was dried and autoradiographed using an intensifying screen at room temperature. Gel Electrophoresis of 5'-Labeled Oligonucleoside Methylphosphonates. Polyacrylamide gels were prepared by polymerizing a solution containing 18% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.8% (w/v) N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide. 7M urea, 89 mM Tris-borate (pH 8.2), 2 mM EDTA, 0.07% (w/v) ammonium persulfate, in the presence of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (20 Pil/20 ml solution). The solution was poured into a 0.75 x 140 x 150 mm mold and allowed to polymerize for 2 hrs at room temperature. 5'-Labeled oligonucleoside methylphosphonates were dissolved in 10% aqueous glycerol solution containing 0.04% bromophenol blue and applied to the gel. The electrophoresis was run using 89 mM Tris-Borate buffer containing 10 mM EDTA.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis of Protected Oligonucleoside Methylphosphonates. Table I shows some of the protected oligonucleoside methylphosphonates which have been synthesized on aminomethyl succinyl-derivatized polystyrene supports. The basic synthetic steps which are shown in Figure 1 are described in detail in the Experimental section. These steps are: (1) removal of the dimethoxytrityl group with 1 M zinc bromide solution; (2) drying the support via co-evaporation with anhydrous pyridine; (3) reaction of the support-bound nucleoside or oligonucleotide with a coupling mixture containing 0.15 to 0.2 M d-[(MeO)2Tr)-NpjEt3NH and 0.3 to 0.6 M mesitylenesulfonyl-3-nitrotriazole in anhydrous pyridine and (4) acetylation of unreacted 5'-OH groups with acetic anhydride. The reactions and washing steps were most conveniently carried out in a polypropylene Econo Column fitted with a septum cap and a 3-way Teflon DMTrO ,O Figure 1: Preparation of Protected Oligonucleoside Methylphosphonates on a 1 T o w Polystyrene Support 0 H BFvON DlDTrOjO4B U )I CH3-gd-OEt 3NH 0 6232 Nucleic Acids Research stopcock. Thus no transfers of the support are required using this apparatus. The synthetic procedure is analogous to the phosphotriester approach used to prepared protected oligonucleotide phosphotriesters on polystyrene supports (6). However, we found the methylphosrhonate coupling reaction to be extremely sensitive to moisture. Drying procedures such as washing with anhydrous solvent or blowing dry nitrogen gas through the support which are satisfactory for phosphotriester synthesis resulted in low yields of the methylphosphonates. The best yields were obtained when the support was co-evaporated with anhydrous pyridine by directly attaching the reaction column to a vacuum pump and dry-ice trap. Three 10 min co-evaporations were sufficient to render the support anhydrous. The protected nucleoside 3'-methylphosphonate triethylammonium salts used in the coupling reactions were prepared from their cyanoethyl ester derivatives (3). These monomers were recovered after each coupling step and were freed of unreacted MSNT by a simple extraction step. After precipitation and drying, the monomers could be reused for other syntheses. The ability to recover the unreacted monomers is particularly important for large scale synthesis since large excesses of these materials are employed in the coupling step. This recovery step represents a potential advantage over the phosphine synthetic method (4), since it is not clear that nucleoside 3'-methylphosphine chlorides can be recovered after reaction. Two types of methylphosphonate oligomers were prepared; those which contain only methylphosphonate linkages, oligomers 1-6, and those which terminate with a 5'-nucleoside 3'-p-chlorophenyl phosphotriester moiety, oligomers 7-10. Oligomers were synthesized on both 1% and 2% crosslinked supports. As shown in Table I, the average yield per coupling step which was determined by trityl group analysis was approximately 82%, for both types of support. This yield is adequate to allow preparation of protected octamers or nonamers in 25% and 20% overall yield, respectively. Deprotection. Our previous studies (1) and those of Sinha et al. (4) show that methylphosphonate linkages are cleaved by base. We found this hydrolysis reaction to depend to some extent upon the nucleoside sequence of the oligomer. Hydrolysis of methylphosphonate linkages by concentrated ammonium hydroxide in pyridine (1:1 v/v), the reagent commonly used to remove oligonucleotide base protecting groups, can be largely suppressed if the reactions are run at 0?C (1). However, these conditions are unsatisfactory for removal of oligonucleoside methylphosphonates from the polystyrene 6233 Nucleic Acids Research Table I.

We therefore examined other deprotection procedures. Recently Barnett and Letsinger described removal of base protecting groups from oligonucleotide B,B,0-trichloroethylphosphotriesters using a mixture of ethylenediamine in phenol (7). We have found ethylenediamine in ethanol (1:1, v/v) rapidly and cleanly removes benzoyl and isobutyryl protecting groups from dA, dC and dG nucleosides. This reagent is particularly attractive since it can be easily removed by evaporation. In our initial investigations, ol igonucleoside methylphosphonates were cleaved from the support and base protecting groups were removed by treatment with ethylenediamine/ethanol (1:1, v/v) at 65?C for 3 hrs. Although preliminary results indicated the methylphosphonate linkages of several dimers were stable to these conditions, we later found that the linkages of onger 6234 Nucleic Acids Research Table II.

This of course resulted in loss of product as was evidenced by the presence of shorter oligomers in amounts greater than expected based upon the coupling yields. To circumvent this problem we examined the deprotection reactions at lower temperatures and found they could be run effectively at room temperature. Table II shows the half-lives for removing the base protecting groups from nucleosides at room temperature. While the isobutryl protecting group is removed at the slowest rate, all the groups are completely removed within 240 min. The sole product of each reaction is the 5'-O-dimethoxytritylnucleoside as shown by TLC. Table II also shows the half-lives for cleavage of protected nucleosides from the 1% crosslinked support. The deoxyguanosine nucleoside is cleaved most rapidly while the other three nucleosides have essentially the same rates of hydrolysis. All the nucleosides are completely removed from the support within 7 hrs. In contrast, very different rates were observed for the 2% crosslinked supports. In these cases, very little cleavage occurred during the first 4 hrs of incubation after which increasing amounts of nucleoside were released over a 24 hr period. This effect may be due to the slower swelling rate of the 2% crosslinked support versus the 1% support. The results of these experiments suggest that, although condensation reactions occur with equal efficiencies on both the 1% and 2% crosslinked supports, the 1% support is preferred for syntheses since the oligomers can be removed more readily under mild conditions. The stability of the methylphosphonate linkage in a number of oligomers of varying chain length and base composition was examined following prolonged exposure to ethylenediamine/ethanol at room temperature. As shown in Table III, some of these oligomers, most notably the dimer and d-GpGpT, were 6235 Nucleic Acids Research Table III.

The maximum rate of hydrolysis for a methylphosphonate linkage in those oligomers which were hydrolyzed is estimated to be 0.13 mole %/hr. The results of these studies show that the oligonucleoside methylphosphonates could be cleaved from the 1% crosslinked support and completely freed of base protecting groups with little or no hydrolysis of the methylphosphonate linkage by treatment with ethylenediamine/ethanol (1:1, v/v) at room temperature for 7 hrs. These conditions were subsequently adopted for the deprotection step. Purification of Oligonucleoside Methylphosphonates. Two methods were employed to purify oligomers following cleavage from the support. For oligomers which contain only methylphosphonate linkages, the tritylated oligomer was isolated by preparative reversed phase HPLC. This separation is based upon the greater affinity of the tritylated oligomer for the hydrophobic C-18 matrix of the column. Shorter, non-tritylated oligomers were first eluted with a 0% to 25% or 0% to 30% acetonitrile in water gradient. The tritylated product was then eluted with a step gradient of 50% acetonitrile in water. The dimethoxytrityl group was removed from the material in the 50% acetonitrile fraction by treatment with 80% acetic acid at room temperature. Because these oligomers were originally cleaved from the support by ethylenediamine/ethanol (1:1, v/v) at 65?C, we usually found that the tritylated oligomer fraction contained shorter oligomers in addition to the desired product. These were easily separated by preparative reversed phase HPLC. While this purification procedure is qualitatively satisfactory, recoveries from the reversed phase columns varied from 50% to 90%. These losses which appeared to be due to irreverisble absorption of the oligomers to the column varied depending on the base composition of the oligomers. 6236 Nucleic Acids Research Figure 2: Purification of d-ApApApApGpCpApApG.

These oligomers 6237 b Nucleic Acids Research were then cleaved from the support and the base protecting groups were removed by treatment with ethylenediamine/ethanol (1:1, v/v) for 7 hrs at room temperature. For example, the reversed phase HPLC profile for products obtained after cleavage of the nonamer, d-[(MeO)2Tr]ApAjApApGpCpApApG, is shown in Figure 2a. The peaks marked with (X) are from impurities in the solvents used to elute the oligomer from the support. The tritylated nonamer appears at 22 min in the chromatogram and is eluted with 50% aqueous acetonitrile. After removal of the dimethoxytrityl group, the nonamer elutes at 15.2 min (Figure 2b). The peaks which appear between 19 and 25 min are shorter oligomers which contain a 5'-mesitylenesulfonate group. At this stage, the nonamer was partially purified by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE cellulose column. This step, which resulted in 84% recovery of material loaded onto the column, removed most of the shorter oligomers as shown in Figure 2c. After removal of the buffer, the nonamer was purified by preparative reversed phase HPLC using a 0% to 30% acetonitrile in 0.1 M ammonium acetate gradient. The recovery of material from the column (84%) appears to be higher when ammonium acetate is used. The pure nonamer (Figure 2d) was obtained in 10% overall yield based on the amount of d-[(MeO)2 Tr]ibuG originally bound to the polystyrene support. The oligomer was desalted on a Bio-Gel P-2 gel filtration column. Similar results were obtained for the other oligomers purified by this method. Thus, for example dApApA and d-ApCpCpApT were obtained in 44% and 22% isolated yields respectively based upon the amount of d-[(MeO)2Tr]N. The 5'-terminal nucleotide may be removed enzynatically to give an oligomer which contains only methylphosphonate linkages. Thus treatment of the nonamer, d-ApApApApGpCpApApG, with spleen phosphodiesterase gave d-Ap and the octamer d-ApApApGpCpApApG whose retention time is 16.4 min on the reversed phase column. The noncharged octamer was freed of d-Ap and enzyne by simply passing it through a small DEAE cellulose column. Characterization. Methylphosphonate linkages are cleaved by base. We have found piperdine is particularly effective. The cleavage occurs in a random manner giving nucleosides, nucleoside 3'- or 5'-methylphosphonates and nucleoside 3',5'-bis-methylphosphonates. This hydrolysis reaction may be used to characterize dimers, since the identity and ratio of the products formed are easily determined by reversed phase HPLC. However, the method becomes less satisfactory for longer oligomers. Purine-containing oligonucleoside methylphosphonates may be depurinated by treatment with hydrochloric acid at 650. The methylphosphonate linkage is 6238 Nucleic Acids Research 9 0 OH cH3P:O cH CH3P 9 9 CH-P :O C cH :0pO O~~ ~j4 HO OP 3 0 H 0 0OH0 9 S S Figure 3: Hydrolysis of the internucleoside methylphsophonate linkages at an apurinic site produced by treatment of the oligomer with hydrochloric acid at pH 2. resistant to hydrolysis by these conditions as shown by the stability of d-TpT and d-TpTpT. On the other hand, dimers or trimers containing purine bases such as d-ApA, dApT, dTpA or d-ApApA have half-lives between 92 and 144 min in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid. Following neutralization with ammonium hydroxide, the products of these reactions were characterized by reversed phase HPLC. d-ApA gave adenine, while both d-ApT and d-TpA gave adenine and thymidine as the sole products of the reaction. Adenine and d-ApA were the only products observed when d-ApApA was partially hydrolyzed. When d-CpCpApT was completely hydrolyzed in acid three products, d-CpC, adenine and thynidine, were observed in a molar ratio of 1:1:1. In contrast to the base hydrolysis of the methylphosphonate group, apurinic sites produced by acid treatment are further hydrolyzed to nucleosides or oligomers with free 5'- and 3'-OH groups. The absence of terminal phosphonate residues suggests hydrolysis occurs as shown in Figure 3. The OH group on the 4'-carbon generated by opening the ribose at the apurinic site may participate in an intramolecular attack on the adjacent phosphonate linkages which results in removal of the phosphonate residues from the neighboring nucleoside hydroxyls. Previous studies by Agarwal and Riftina indicated dithymidine methyl- or phenylphosphonates can be phosphorylated by polynucleotide kinase (9). Sinha et al. reported that dimers but not trimers or tetramers served as substrates for this enzyme (4). We were unable to phosphorylate tetramers or longer oligomers which contain only methylphosphonate linkages. However, those oligomers which terminate with a 5'-dAp-residue are readily 6239 Nucleic Acids Research a ATP 1 1 2 3 4 b 6 mer Mik 6 mer go 3mer a a a X 2mer do ATP 411 12 w 34 1 2 3 4 5 6 Figure 4: (a) PEI-cellulose TLC of T4 polynucleotide kinase reactions. 1) [y-32p]ATP; 2) d-ApApA reaction mixture; 3) d-ApGpCpApApG reaction mixture; 4) d-ApApApApG_pCpApAeG reaction mixture.

The phosphorylation reaction is easily followed by PEI-cellulose TLC. As shown in Figure 4a, the phosphorylated oligomers have a higher Rf values than does d-ATP. The phosphorylated methylphosphonate oligomers can be separated according to their chain lengths by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on an 18% gel containing 7 M urea as shown in Figure 4(b). Lane 1 shows the separation of a trimer, hexamer and nonamer. The band which appears directly below the nonamer may arise from traces of contaminating octamer which were not removed during the purification of d-ApApApApGpCpApApG. 6240 Nucleic Acids Research When the oligomers were partially hydrolyzed with piperidine, a series of new bands appears corresponding to shorter oligomers produced via hydrolysis of the methylphosphonate linkages (Lanes 2-4). Because of the random nature of this cleavage reaction, the oligomers should terminate with either a 3'-OH or a 3'-methylphosphonate group. In the case of the trimer, 32pApApA, hydrolysis gives two bands which correspond to d-32pApA and d-32pApAp (Lane 2). The same products are observed for hydrolysis of the nonamer, d-32pApApApApGpCpApApG (Lane 4). A similar situation is observed for d32pApGpCpApApG although the dimers d-32pApG and d-32pApGp have somewhat different mobilities (Lane 3). These dimers cannot be separated when the gel is run in the absence of urea. It is possible to determine the chain lengths of the original oligomers by counting the number of oligomers produced by partial piperidine hydrolysis. For example, starting with the trimer band, one can observe 3 bands corresponding to tetramer, pentamer and hexamer for the hydrolysis products of d-32pApGpCpApApG (Lane 3) and 6 bands corresponding to tetramer, pentamer, hexamer, heptamer, octamer and nonamer for the hydrolysis products of 32pApApApApGpCpApApG (Lane 4). The positions of the oligomers of the same chain length appear to be very similar which suggests that the mobilities are not greatly affected by base composition on the urea-containing gel. This procedure thus provides a rapid and convenient method for characterizing the methyl phosphonate ol i gomers. Treatment of the phosphorylated oligomers with acid produces shorter oligomers which result from chain cleavage at apurinic sites. In this case the oligomers terminate with a 3'-OH group. Treatment of 32pApGpCpApALpG produces an intense band corresponding to the pentamer, d-32pApGjCpAjA (Lane 5) while treatment of 32pApApApApGpCpApApG produces an intense band corresponding to the octamer d-32pApApAPApGpCpApA and fainter bands corresponding to the heptamer, hexamer, tetramer and trimer. These results suggest that under the conditions of the experiment, hydrolysis occurs preferentially at the 3'-terminal G residue of both oligomers. It should be possible to extend this methodology to other base specific depurination or depyrimidination reactions similar to those employed in the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing method (10). Experiments directed toward this goal are currently in progress and will be reported in a future communication.

2531092|t|A case of demand ischemia from phendimetrazine
2531092|a|Abstract Introduction Phendimetrazine is a medication currently being used to help patients with weight loss. It shares a chemical structure with amphetamines. As such, it shares some of the same toxicities, which can include cardiac toxicity. This case highlights this principle. Case presentation a 54 year old Caucasian female presented to our urgent care facility with complaints of chest pains and other symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Ultimately, she was transferred to the emergency room. After evaluation there, it appeared she was having demand ischemia from prescription diet pills Conclusion This case report demonstrates the potential dangers of amphetamine based diet pills. There have been other cases of cardiomyopathies related to phendimetrazine, but it is something that is rarely recognized in an outpatient setting. A case such as this demonstrates the importance of obtaining a careful medication history in all patients and in recognizing diet pills with an amphetamine base can cause cardiac toxicity. Case presentation A 54 year-old Caucasian female presented to our urgent care facility complaining of nausea and vomiting, sense of impending doom and vague chest pain radiating toward her left side for about five hours. She never had similar symptoms in the past. She also denied anything that could have precipitated these symptoms. Her only past medical history was significant for spina bifida. Her medications included occasional Fiorinal (unknown dose), Xanax 0.5 mg as needed, and Phendimetrazine (unclear dose). Her social history was significant for smoking 1/2 pack per day cigarette use. She denied alcohol use. Family history was non contributory. She worked from home. Her physical exam showed a tachycardia of around 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16, temperature of 98.1, and O2 saturation of 100% on room air. She was approximately 5'7" and 145 pounds. In general, she was an anxious appearing, diaphoretic woman in moderate distress, she had no elevated JVD at 30 degrees, her heart was tachycardic, but otherwise without murmur, gallops, or rubs, her lungs were clear, abdomen soft, and she had no peripheral edema. An EKG was checked which appears below (figure 1). After examination, there was concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). She was given nitroglycerin with relief of her chest discomfort. She was also given aspirin to chew. EMS was called and she was transferred to a local emergency room. She was hospitalized there for three days and after her discharge, we got permission from her to request records. While hospitalized, she was ruled out for ACS with negative troponins. She was also given beta blockade which resolved her tachycardia and her T wave changes on EKG. The next morning, she had an adenosine stress test which revealed normal uptake with no areas of ischemia and an ejection fraction of 55%. She was monitored for one more day and then discharged with instructions to discontinue her diet pills. Discussion Phendimetrazine is a medication currently being used for weight loss, with potential for illicit use. It has a similar chemical composition of amphetamines, which is thought to account for its clinical actions [1]. Amphetamines are well recognized as an etiology of cardiac ischemia, however phendimetrazine is more rarely described in the literature as causing cardiac events. [2,3]. Acute effects include hyperpyrexia, mydriasis, chest pain, arrhytmias, delirium, and, rhabdomylosis, among others [2]. Long term use has been associated with dilated cardiomyopathies, some of which have resolved with discontinuation of the medication [3]. In this particular case, it appears she may have developed a demand ischemia from the medication. It is not known how much of the drug she was taking. Initially, she was resistant to accepting that phendimetrazine could induce side effects, and there was suspicion that she could have been taking more of the drug that recommended. In addition, she was not prescribed the medication and would not admit to where she obtained it. As the public seems to have more focus on using medications to induce weight loss, this may be a more recognized complication and heart conditions should likely be monitored prior to starting amphetamine based weight loss pills. Conclusion Due to potentially detrimental effects of this medication, phendimetrazine should be used cautiously in many situations. As it shares its chemical structure with amphetamines, it also shares many of the side effects and the potential for abuse/addiction. There have been other reports in literature describing adverse outcomes from phendimetrazine as well as other weight loss medications. Therefore, cautious use is warranted.

Independentei 202, R-77208 Bucharest, Roumania Abstract: Metal complexes of heterocyclic sulfonamides possessing carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitory properties were recently shown to be useful as intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering agents in experimental animals, and might be developed as a novel class of antiglaucoma drugs. Here we report the synthesis of a heterocyclic sulfonamide CA inhibitor and of the metal complexes containing main group metal ions, such as Be(II), Mg(II), AI(III), Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) and the new sulfonamide as well as 5-amino-l,3,4thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide as ligands. The new complexes were characterized by standard physico-chemical procedures, and assayed as inhibitors of three CA isozymes, CA I, II and IV. Some of them (but not the parent sulfonamides) strongly lowered IOP in rabbits when administered as a 2% solution into the eye. Introduction Sulfonamides possessing carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) inhibitory properties [2] such as acetazolamide 1, methazolamide 2, ethoxzolamide 3 and dichlorophenamide 4 have been used for more than 40 years as pressure lowering systemic drugs in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma [3,4]. Their effect is due to inhibition of at least two CA isozymes present within cilliary processes of the eye, ie, CA II and CA IV, which is followed by lowered bicarbonate formation and reduction of aqueous humor secretion [5-7]. Their main drawback is constituted by side effects such as fatigue, augmented diuresis, or paresthesias, due to CA inhibition in other tissues/organs than the target one, ie, the eye [8]. N--N XN--N EtO S NH 2 O NH O:S----O NHEt The above-mentioned side effects are absent in the case in which the inhibitor has topical activity, and is applied directly into the eye. This route has been demonstrated only in 1983 by Maren's group [9] and was followed by the development of the first clinical agent of this type, dorzolamide 5 [10,11 ]. Dorzolamide (Trusopt) has been introduced in clinical use in 1995 in USA and Europe and it constituted the beginning of a radically new treatment of glaucoma, devoid of the severe side effects observed with the systemic inhibitors [4-6]. The success of topical antiglaucoma CA inhibitors fostered much research in the synthesis and clinical evaluation of other types of such compounds [12-15]. 307  Vol. 4, No. 6, 1997 Metal Complexes of Heterocyclic Sulfonamides: A New Class ofAntiglaucoma Agents On the other hand, metal complexes of heterocyclic sulfonamides of type 1-5 have been recently prepared by two groups 16-20], and it was proved that they possess much stronger CA inhibitory properties than the sulfonamides from which they were prepared 18-22]. Although the mechanism of CA inhibition of the metal complexes is presently unknown, it was hypothesized that their increased inhibitory power might be due to two processes, occurring separately or in concert, ie, (i) dissociation of the complex inhibitor in sulfonamide anions and metal ions (in diluted solution), which in turn both interact thereafter with the enzyme, at different binding sites, and (ii) direct interaction of the undissociated complex with the enzyme, and more specifically with the hydrophilic patch at the entrance of CA II active site [23], this being the isozyme most susceptible to inhibition with this class of compounds [2,22]. Whether initially the first mechanism of action mentioned above was favored by us [22], recent evidences suggested that the undissociated complex might be the inhibitory species, at least for some isozymes [24]. Since metal complexes are much more inhibitory than the parent sulfonamide from which they were prepared, it appeared of interest to test whether this property might be useful for their use in lowering IOP in experimental animals and whence as a possible glaucoma therapy. Recently we proved [25, 26] that some metal complexes of heterocyclic sulfonamides (which themselves do not possess IOP lowering properties) act as very powerful such agents when administered as diluted solutions directly into the eye of experimental animals, and would thus offer the possibility of developing such totally novel drugs. Here we report the synthesis of a heterocyclic sulfonamide possessing strong CA inhibitory properties, ie, 5-(chloroacetamido)-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide, and of the metal complexes of this sulfonamide and of 5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide, containing some main group metal ions. The new compounds have been characterized by standard physico-chemical procedures, and were assayed as inhibitors of three CA isozymes, hCA I, hCA II and bCA IV (h human; b bovine; these are the isozymes considered to play a critical role in aqueous humour secretion within the eye of higher vertebrates [2-5]). Materials and Methods Melting points were recorded with a heating plate microscope and are not corrected. IR spectra were recorded in KBr pellets with a Carl Zeiss IR-80 instrument. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded in DMSO-d6 as solvent, with a Bruker CPX200 instrument. Chemical shifts are reported as values, relative to Me4Si as internal standard. Conductimetric measurements were done at room temperature (1 mM concentration of complex) in DMSO solution with a Fisher conductimeter. Elemental analyses were done by combustion for C, H, N with an automated Carlo Erba analyzer, and gravimetrically for the metal ions, and were 0.4% of the theoretical values. Thermogravimetric measurements were done in air, at a heating rate of 10C/min., with a Perkin Elmer 3600 thermobalance. Sulfonamides used as standards in the enzymatic assay (except for 5), acetazolamide, pyridine, and chloroacetyl chloride used for the preparation of compound 7, solvents as well as inorganic reagents were from Sigma, Merck and Carlo Erba. 5-Amino-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 6 was prepared from acetazolamide by literature procedures [27], by desacetylation with concentrated hydrochloric acid, followed by neutralization with sodium bicarbonate of the corresponding hydrochloride (Scheme 1). Dorzolamide hydrochloride 5 was from Merck, Sharp and Dohme or was prepared as described by Ponticello et al 10,11 ]. Human CA and CA II cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) from the plasmids pACA/hCA I and pACAdaCA II described by Forsman et al. [28] (the two plasmids were a gift from Prof. Sven Lindskog, Umea University, Sweden). Cell growth conditions were those described by Lindskog's group [29], and enzymes were purified by affinity chromatography according to the method of Khalifah et al [30]. Enzyme concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, utilizing a molar absorptivity of 49 mM-l.cm-1 for hCA and 54 mM-l.cm-1 for hCA II, respectively, based on M 28.85 kDa for hCA I, and 29.3 kDa for hCA II, respectively [31,32]. bCA IV was isolated from bovine lung microsomes as described by Maren et al, and its concentration has been determined by titration with ethoxzolamide [33]. Synthesis of 5-(chloroacetamido)- l, 3, 4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 7 An amount of 1.80 g (10 mmol) of 5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 6 was suspended in 20 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile and 0.9 mL (0.87g, 11 mmol) of pyridine added. The mixture was magnetically stirred at 4 C for 10 minutes, then 10.5 mmol of monochloroacetyl chloride, dissolved in 3 mL acetonitrile, were added dropwise for 5 min, and stirring was continued for other 2 hours at room temperature. After an additional 30 min of refluxation, followed by cooling, the precipitated crystals were filtered and recrystallized from ethanol.

General procedure for the preparation of compounds 8-20 An amount of 6 mmol of sodium salt of sulfonamides 6 or 7 was prepared by reacting the corresponding sulfonamide with the required amount of an alcoholic 1N NaOH solution, in ethanol as solvent. To this 308  Claudiu T. Supuran et al. Metal-Based Drugs solution was added the aqueous metal salt (Zn(II), Mg(II), AI(III), Cd(II) chlorides, and Be(II), Pb(II) and Hg(II) nitrate) solution, working in molar ratios RSOzNH- Mn+ of 2:1 for the divalent cations and 3:1 for the trivalent cation, respectively. The aqueous-alcoholic reaction mixture was heated on a steam bath for one hour, adjusting the pH at 7 if necessary, and after being cooled at 0 C the precipitated complexes were filtered and thoroughly washed with alcohol-water 1:1 (v/v) and air dried. Yields were in the range of 85-90 %. The obtained white powders of compounds 8-20 melted with decomposition at temperatures higher than 350 C, and were poorly soluble in water and alcohol, but had good solubilities in DMSO, DMF as well as mixtures of DMSO-water, DMF-water. Pharmacology Carbonic anhydrase inhibition Initial rates of 4-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis catalysed by different CA isozymes were monitored spectrophotometrically, at 400 rim, with a Cary 3 instrument interfaced with an IBM compatible PC [35]. Solutions of substrate were prepared in anhydrous acetonitrile; the substrate concentrations varied between 2.10-2 and 1.10-6 M, working at 25C. A molar absorption coefficient of 18,400 M-l.cm-1 was used for the 4-nitrophenolate formed by hydrolysis, in the conditions of the experiments (pH 7.40), as reported in the literature [35]. Non-enzymatic hydrolysis rates were always subtracted from the observed rates. Duplicate experiments were done for each inhibitor concentration, and the values reported throughout the paper are the mean of such results. Stock solutions of inhibitor (1 mM) were prepared in distilled-deionized water with 1020% (v/v) DMSO (which is not inhibitory at these concentrations [2]) and dilutions up to 0.01 nM were done thereafter with distilled-deionized water. Inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 10 min at room temperature prior to assay, in order to allow for the formation of the E-I complex. The inhibition constant KI was determined as described by Pocket and Stone [35]. Enzyme concentrations were 3.3 nM for hCA II, l0 nM for hCA and 34 nM for bCA IV (this isozyme has a decreased esterase activity [36] and higher concentrations had to be used for the-measurements). Measurement of tonometric lOP Adult male New Zealand albino rabbits weighing 2-3 kg were used in the experiments (three animals were used for each inhibitor studied). The experimental procedures conform to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Resolution on the use of animals. The rabbits were kept in individual cages with food and water provided ad libitum. The animals were maintained on a 12 h: 12 h light/dark cycle in a temperature controlled room, at 22-26 C. Solutions of inhibitors (2 %, by weight) were obtained in DMSOwater (2:3, v/v) due to the low water solubility of some of these derivatives. Control experiments with DMSO (at the same concentration as that used for obtaining the inhibitors solutions showed that it does not possess IOP lowering or increasing effects. IOP was measured using a Digilab 30R pneumatonometer (BioRad, Cambridge, MA, USA) as described by Maren's group [37-39]. The pressure readings were matched with two-point standard pressure measurements at least twice each day using a Digilab Calibration verifier. All IOP measurements were done by the same investigator with the same tonometer. One drop of 0.2 % oxybuprocaine hydrochloride (novesine, Sandoz) diluted 1"1 with saline was instilled in each eye immediately before each set of pressure measurements. IOP was measured three times at each time interval, and the means reported. IOP was measured first immediately before drug administration, then at 30 min after the instillation of the pharmacological agent, and then each 30 minutes for a period of several hours. For all IOP experiments drug was administered to only one eye, leaving the contralateral eye as an untreated control. The ocular hypotensive activity is expressed as the average difference in IOP between the treated and control eye, in this way minimizing the diurnal, seasonal and interindividual variations commonly observed in the rabbit [37-39]. All data are expressed as mean SE, using a one-tailed test. Results and Discussion Reaction of 5-amino-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 6 [19b] with chloroacteyl chloride in the presence of pyridine afforded 5-(chloroacetamido)-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 7, by the procedure already reported by Young et al. [34] (Scheme 1). The sulfonamide 7 has been characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic methods which confirmed its structure (only its m.p. has been reported in ref. [34]). The sodium salt of sulfonamides 6 and 7, obtained in situ from the corresponding sulfonamide and sodium hydroxide, were then used for the preparation of coordination compounds, containing the following metal ions: Be(II), Mg(II), Al(III), Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II). Mention should be made that although 5-amino-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 6 is the parent compound of important sulfonamide CA inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, benzolamide, methazolamide, etc., its coordination chemistry has been scarcely investigated up to now [22, 40]. The new complexes prepared in this work are shown in Table I. Both compounds containing the sulfonamide-deprotonated species of sulfonamide 7 (LH), as well as complexes in which the anion of 5amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide (tda) act as ligands, have been prepared. In fact in another work [40] it was documented that in some cases, sulfonamides derived from this ring system may undergo hydrolysis to 309  Vol. 4, No. 6, 1997 Metal Complexes of Heterocyclic Sulfonamides." A New Class ofAntiglaucoma Agents the moiety substituting the 5 position, with the formation of 5-amino-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 6, which thereafter coordinates metal ions present in solution.

On the other hand, when the ligand 7 has not been hydrolyzed (during the preparation of the coordination compounds) in the presence of the metal ion to 5-amino-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2sulfonamide and chloroacetate, the metal complexes contining 6 as ligand have been prepared from the last (pure) compound (as sodium salt) and the corresponding metal salt, by the general procedure described in the Experimental part.

The new complexes have also been characterized by spectroscopic, conductimetric and thermogravimetric measurements (Table II). By comparing the IR spectra of the complexes and the corresponding ligands, the following observations should be made: (i) the shift of the two sulfonamido vibrations (both the symmetric as well as the the assymetric one), towards lower wavenumbers in the spectra of the complexes, as compared to the spectra of the corresponding ligand (Table II), as already documented previously for similar complexes [13-22]. This is a direct indication that the deprotonated sulfonamido 310  Claudiu T. Supuran et al. Metal-Based Drugs moieties of the ligands interacts with the metal ions in the newly prepared coordination compounds; (ii) the amide vibrations (the most intense such bands at 1670-1680 cm-1) of ligand 7 appear unchanged in the IR spectra of complexes 15-20 (data not shown), suggesting that these moieties do not participate in coordination of the metal ions; (iii) the C-N stretching vibration in the spectra of the prepared complexes is shifted with 5-20 cm-1 towards lower wavenumbers, as compared to the same vibration in the spectra of sulfonamides 6 and 7, indicating that one of the endocyclic nitrogens of the thiadiazolic ring (presumably N3) acts as donor atom, as already documented by X-ray crystallographic and spectroscopic determinations on complexes of other sulfonamides (such as 1-3) with divalent metal ions [13-22] (Table II); (iv) changes in the region 3100-3160 cm-, as the bands present in the spectra of sulfonamides 6, 7 are present in the spectra of complexes 8-20 too, but they are not well resolved, and have a smaller intensity. This is probably due to deprotonation of the SO2NH2 moiety and participation in the binding of cations; (v) the amino vibrations from 3320 cm- in the spectra of 6 appear unchanged in the spectra of its complexes 8-14 (data not s.hown). In the 1H-NMR spectra of compound 6 and its metal complexes, the signal of the amino group has been evidenced as a broad singlet centered at 4.54 ppm (Table II), which is not exchangeable by addition of D20 into the NMR tube, in contrast to the sulfonamido NH2 protons (which readily exchange). This proves that the 5-amino moiety is not involved in binding the metal ions, as already shown in the X-ray crystallographic work of the complex [Zn(tda)z(NH3)].H20 previously reported [40]. For sulfonamide 7 the CONH proton resonates as a singlet at 12.22 ppm. In complexes 15-20 only very minor shifts of this signal were evidenced (Table II), proving basically that the CONH moiety does not interact with the metal ions in these complexes.

Thermogravimetric analysis showed the presence of uncoordinated water molecules in the molecule of complex 9 (the three waters were lost in a single step, between 70-110 C) and of coordinated water in the molecules of the lead(II) derivatives 13 and 20. All these compounds behaved as non-electrolytes in DMF as solvent (Table II). Mention should be made that the Mg(II) complex of sulfonamide 7 could not be isolated. Instead, only the correponding complex of 5-amino-l,3,4-thiadiazole has been obtained from reaction mixtures containing magnesium salts and the sodium salt of 7, probably due to a metal ion assisted hydrolysis of 7 to 6 and chloroacetate. Generally such hydrolytic processes involve highly acidic conditions and prolonged heating of the 5-alkylamido-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide derivatives [41 ], but they might become milder by taking into account the putative catalytic effect of Mg2+ ions reported here. The data shown above lead to the conclusion that ligand 7 shares a common coordination chemistry with acetazolamide 1 with which it is structurally related, whereas 6 probably also behaves similarly to acetazolamide in the sense that the 5-amino group seems not to be involved in coordinating metal ions, at 311  Vol. 4, No. 6, 1997 Metal Complexes of Heterocyclic Sulfonamides: A New Class ofAntiglaucoma Agents least in the complexes reported by us here (and also in the compound characterized by X-ray crystallography mentioned above [40]). Thus, in all complexes reported here these sulfonamides (as monodeprotonated species at the SO2NH 2 moieties) act as bidentate ligands, through the endocyclic N-3 and the NH- groups. The proposed formulae of the new complxes are shown below. Except for the two Pb(II) complexes 13 and 20, as well as the AI(III) derivatives 14 and 16, which presumably are pseudo-octahedral, the other derivatives are supposed to contain tetrahedral M(II) ions. R R 13"R = 20" R= H2N CICH2CONH 14: R = 16: R = H2N CICH2CONH The compounds 6-20 together with the standard CA inhibitors 1-5 were assayed for inhibition against three isozymes, hCA I, hCA II and bCA IV (Table III). As seen from the above data, the chloracetamido derivative is more inhibitory than acetazolamide, methazolamide and dichlorophenamide, whereas the unacylated compound 6 is less inhibitory than the above sulfonamides. The metal complexes 820 are much more inhibitory than the sulfonamides from which they derive 6, 7 and than all other simple sulfonamides assayed. They behave similarly to the metal complexes of acetazolamide, methazolamide or dorzolamide previously reported by this group, which were all more inhibitory than the parent sulfonamide from which were prepared [16-22, 40]. Particularly strong inhibition was observed for the Zn(II), Hg(II), Pb(II) and Cd(II) complexes, especially against CA II and CA IV, the isozymes critical for aqueous humor formation. In vivo IOP lowering experiments were done in rabbits with some of the new compounds prepared in the present work, such as the sulfonamides 6 and 7, and their Zn(II) complexes, which were among the strong CA II and CA IV inhibitors in the obtained series. Some of the IOP lowering data at half an hour and one hour after the instillation of one drop of 2 % solution of inhibitor within the rabbit eye are shown in 312  Claudiu T. Supuran et al.

As seen from the above data, the sulfonamides 6 and 7 are totally ineffective as lOP lowering agents, similarly to the classical clinically used inhibitors of type 1-5 [2,3]. On the other hand, dorzolamide, the first topical sulfonamide used clinically in the treatment of glaucoma is an effective such agent, with a decrease of lOP of around 4 mm Hg, one hour after administration directly into the eye (Table IV). From the data of this table, it is obvious that the metal complexes of heterocyclic sulfonamides investigated by us behave as much more effective IOP lowering agents than dorzolamide, and their effect is generally longerlasting (Fig. 1). A last remark should be made about the possible mechanism of action of the new class of IOP lowering agents. Obviously, their activity is due to inhibition of CA isozymes present in the cilliary processes within the eye, similarly to other topically active sulfonamides [2-6]. The fact that the sulfonamide per se is inactive via the topical route, whereas the metal complexes result much better than the drug 313  Vol. 4, No. 6, 1997 Metal Complexes of Heterocyclic Sulfonamides." A New Class ofAntiglaucoma Agents dorzolamide, indicates that the presence of metal ions in the molecules of these CA inhibitors is essential and confers them completely new properties.

Preliminary results from this laboratory indicate that the metal complexes of topically active sulfonamides show also increased lOP lowering effects with respect to the complexes prepared in the present study [42]. Our hypothesis is that the presence of the metal ion in the molecules of these complex inhibitors induces a dramatic change in their physico-chemical properties as compared to those of the parent sulfonamide. This phenomenon is certainly governed by the strong polarization induced by the metal ions. In this way, it is quite probable that the right balance between the lipo- and hydrosolubility of these compounds is achieved, which has been considered to be the critical factor for not observing topical activity in the classical CA inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, methazolamide and ethoxzolamide, which were either too lipophilic or too hy.drosoluble [2,3]. So, by choosing different metal ions and diverse sulfonamides, much larger possibilities arise to finely tune the pharmacological properties which strongly influence the value of a drug. In conclusion we describe here a novel class of lOP lowering agents, ie, the metal complexes of sulfonamide CA inhibitors. These derivatives appear to be very active and longer lasting than the drug dorzolamide, and might constitute the premises for a new generation of antiglaucoma drugs. Acknowledgments.

1538864|t|QGRS Mapper: a web-based server for predicting G-quadruplexes in nucleotide sequences
1538864|a|Abstract The quadruplex structures formed by guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences have received significant attention recently because of growing evidence for their role in important biological processes and as therapeutic targets. G-quadruplex DNA has been suggested to regulate DNA replication and may control cellular proliferation.

INTRODUCTION The quadruplex structures formed by guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences have received significant attention recently because of increasing evidence for their role in important biological processes and as therapeutic targets (1-5). The G-quadruplex structure, also known as a G-quartet, is formed by repeated folding of either the single polynucleotide molecule or by association of two or four molecules. The structure consists of stacked G-tetrads, which are square co-planar arrays of four guanine bases each (6). G-quadruplex is stabilized with cyclic Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding between the four guanines within each tetrad. The present work focuses only on the unimolecular quadruplexes, since it is more likely to be encountered in physiological conditions (7,8). Guanine-rich sequences capable of forming G-quadruplexes are found in telomeres, promoter regions, transcribed and other biologically important regions of the mammalian genomes. G-quadruplex DNA has been suggested to regulate DNA replication in retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) region (9). This structure may control cellular proliferation at telomeric level and by transcriptional regulation of oncogenes like c-myc (2,10,11) and c-kit (12). Formation of G-quadruplex seems to be regulated through interactions with cellular proteins. While some proteins help stabilize the structure (13), others are known to resolve it (1,4,14,15). Proteins and chemicals that stabilize the G-quadruplex structure can inhibit telomerase action and, therefore, are being evaluated as anticancer therapeutic agents (16-20). Chemical compounds that inhibit G-quadruplex helicase activity may also be capable of regulating cellular proliferation (4). G-quadruplexes are also being eyed as potential antimicrobial agents due to their ability to transport monovalent anions (21). G-quadruplex motifs in the RNA have been shown to play significant roles in mRNA turnover (1), FMRP binding (22), translation initiation (23) as well as repression (24). We have shown previously that a G-rich sequence (GRS) can mediate 3    end processing of mammalian pre-mRNAs by interacting with DSEF-1/hnRNPH/H    protein (25-27). Members of the hnRNP H protein family recognize G-rich motifs capable of forming G-quadruplexes and are known to regulate polyadenylation and splicing events in mammalian transcripts (28-30). Regulated RNA processing is an essential component of differential gene expression which is central to many important biologically processes. More than half of human genes are known to have alternative polyadenylation (31). Over two-thirds of human genes are thought to undergo alternative splicing (32). Sequences capable of forming G-quadruplexes found in the vicinity of polyadenylation and splice sites act as regulators by interacting with hnRNP F and H proteins (25-27,30,33). Whether quadruplex structure directly plays a role in regulating RNA processing events requires investigation. Computational approaches to study G-quadruplexes in the mammalian genomes allow large-scale and detailed analysis of mammalian genes. Although, G-quadruplexes have been surveyed in the human genome with such techniques (34,35), there are no known user-friendly computational tools easily accessible to the public. We had previously built a database of mapped G-quadruplex sequences in selected alternatively processed human and mouse genes (36). Our preliminary analysis of the database suggests prevalence of such motifs near alternative splice and poly(A) sites. We have now developed a web-based server, QGRS Mapper, that generates detailed information on composition and distribution of putative quadruplex forming G-rich sequences (QGRS) in any NCBI nucleotide sequence identified or provided by the user. The program is also designed to handle the analysis of mammalian pre-mRNA sequences, including those that are alternatively processed (alternatively spliced or alternatively polyadenylated). Researchers interested in predicting the ability of a nucleotide sequence to form G-quadruplex structure will find QGRS Mapper to be a user-friendly application that provides many options for analysis. The user can define the minimum number of tetrads, maximum length of the G-quadruplex motif, and size as well as composition of the loops. The program can map unimolecular QGRS in the entire nucleotide sequence provided in the raw or FASTA format by the user. This method can be used for the analysis of genomic sequences, e.g. promoter and telomeric regions, as well as RNA sequences. It is also useful for predicting G-quadruplex structures in oligonucleotides. Alternatively, the program provides options to search the entire NCBI Gene Entrez, RefSeq and GenBank databases in order to retrieve the desired gene/nucleotide sequence entries for analysis of their transcribed regions. Furthermore, QGRS Mapper is a unique tool for mapping G-quadruplex forming sequences in the context of RNA processing sites. This feature is very useful for investigating the functional relevance of G-quadruplex structure, in particular its role in regulating the gene expression by alternative processing. In addition to providing data on composition and locations of QGRS relative to the processing sites in the pre-mRNA sequence, QGRS Mapper offers interactive graphic representation of the data. The user can also use a graphics module to visualize QGRS distribution patterns among all the alternative RNA products of a gene simultaneously on a single screen. METHODS QGRS definition The main goal of the QGRS Mapper program is to predict the presence of QGRS in nucleotide entries. These putative G-quadruplexes are identified using the following motif. GxNy1GxNy2GxNy3Gx Here x = number of guanine tetrads in the G-quadruplex and y1,y2,y3 = length of gaps (i.e. the length of the loops connecting the guanine tetrads). The motif consists of four equal length sets of guanines (which we call G-groups), separated by arbitrary nucleotide sequences, with the following restrictions. The sequence must contain at least two tetrads (i.e. x > 2). Although structures with three or more G-tetrads are considered to be more stable, many nucleotide sequences are known to form quadruplexes with two G-tetrads (37,38). QGRS Mapper is meant to be a flexible and comprehensive tool for investigating G-quadruplexes; hence it considers sequences with two tetrads.By default, only QGRS of maximum length of 30 bases are considered. However, the program gives the user the option to search for sequences up to 45 bases. This restriction on the length of the sequences being considered is in agreement with recent literature (34,35). The maximum length of 30 bases restricts G-groups to a maximum size of 6.The gaps or loops between the G-groups may be arbitrary in composition or length (within the overall restrictions on the length of QGRS). The program gives the user the option to search for QGRS having loops with a specified length range (e.g. the user can search for QGRS with loops of lengths between 1 and 4). The user can also specify a string that one or more loops of each QGRS must contain. This string can be given as a regular expression. For example, entering the regular expression    T{3,5}    will search for QGRS having one or more loops that contain three to five consecutive T's.Also, at most one of the gaps is allowed to be of zero length Table 1 shows some examples of valid QGRS. The guanine groups which form the tetrads are underlined. The first sequence has four tetrads and equal length gaps. This would seem to provide a G-quadruplex that is the most stable of the three sequences. The second sequence is notable for the significant differences in the size of its loops. The third sequence has two tetrads, even though three of the G-groups could have included another G (since all G-groups must be equal in size). G-scores We have devised a scoring system that evaluates a QGRS for its likelihood to form a stable G-quadruplex. Higher scoring sequences will make better candidates for G-quadruplexes. The scoring method uses the following principles which are based on previous studies (34,35,39-42). Shorter loops are more common than longer loops.G-quadruplexes tend to have loops roughly equal in size.The greater the number of guanine tetrads, the more stable the quadruplex. The computed G-scores are dependent on the user selected maximum QGRS length. The highest possible G-score, using the default maximum QGRS length of 30, is 105. Here is a sequence attaining that score: GGGGGGTGGGGGGTGGGGGGTGGGGGG. Eliminating QGRS overlaps Two QGRS are said to overlap if their positions in the nucleotide sequence overlap. QGRS Mapper will start with a nucleotide sequence, find all QGRS occurring in the sequence and then produce a non-overlapping set of QGRS. Overlaps are eliminated by selecting the higher scoring QGRS. In the non-overlapping view, only this sequence will be displayed, although the user can request that all overlapping sequences be displayed. Please see supplementary materials at NAR online for more details on the elimination of overlapping QGRS. FEATURES Design and implementation QGRS Mapper is a web-based program, written in PHP, with Java being used for some of its graphics. The program takes a nucleotide sequence from NCBI (or as provided by the user) and analyzes it for the presence of putative G-quadruplexes. The structure of QGRS Mapper is summarized in Table 2. Search and analysis QGRS Mapper allows the user to search for putative G-quadruplexes in a variety of ways. It is possible to enter a nucleotide sequence in raw or FASTA format for analysis. One can search and analyze gene sequences by Gene ID, Gene name or symbol, accession number or GI number for an NCBI nucleotide sequence entry. The user can opt to change the maximum length of QGRS that will be searched for (the default maximum length being 30) and change the minimum sized G-group (which is two by default). Also, the user can specify that the loops in the QGRS fall within a given size range and that one or more loops of the QGRS contain a given string (for which the user may enter a regular expression). The web page for QGRS analysis can be seen in Figure 1. After entering a sequence in raw or FASTA format, QGRS Mapper will search the sequence for occurrences of QGRS. The user may enter any combination of the letters A, C, T, G, U, N. The Gene ID field allows the user to search the NCBI Entrez Gene database. QGRS Mapper will connect to NCBI, download and parse the gene entry, and then analyze the transcribed region of its nucleotide sequence for the presence of QGRS. For example, entering the gene ID 403437 results in downloading the Brca1 gene sequence for Canis familiaris. Using the default QGRS search parameters, QGRS Mapper finds 156 non-overlapping QGRS and 3394 overlapping QGRS in the transcribed region of this gene. The Gene Name or Gene Symbol field also allows the user to search the NCBI databases for all such genes. Entering the gene name Bcl2 results in nine different hits which are displayed in Table 3. All nine of these entries can be analyzed for the occurrence of QGRS. Clicking on the Gene ID takes the user to the respective Entrez Gene entry. Clicking on the last column initiates analysis of the selection by QGRS Mapper. Similarly, the user can also enter an NCBI accession number to search for gene sequences. For example, searching the accession number AF312033 results in 12 hits being displayed for this GenBank nucleotide sequence entry. The search phase of the program is followed by an analysis of the QGRS contained in the query sequence. In this phase of QGRS Mapper, the sequence data downloaded previously is analyzed to identify and map all QGRS relative to locations such as splice sites in exons/introns, and poly(A) site (if these locations are known). Furthermore the QGRS are scored by the method described above. The computed G-score is used to eliminate overlapping QGRS. At times, QGRS Mapper must analyze a considerable amount of data. For example, the mouse version of the gene PTPRU, which is 69822 bases long, contains 94681 QGRS of length up to 45 bases. QGRS Mapper will find, analyze and map all of these sequences. During this analysis a message is displayed indicating the estimated time left to completion. QGRS Mapper output After the analysis of overlaps is completed, QGRS Mapper displays a summary of its findings, in the Gene View. This summary includes basic gene information such as the gene ID, gene symbol, gene name, a link to the NCBI entry, organism name, chromosome number and number of products and poly(A) signals. Information is also given for each product, such as the number of exons and introns, number of QGRS (non-overlapping and overlapping), number of QGRS found near RNA processing sites, and a visual map of the product. As an example, the Gene View for the human GREB1 is displayed in Figure 2, showing the table of gene information and product information for the first product (the output for all products may be seen in the supplementary material). At this stage in the analysis the user can choose among three further displays:    Data View   ,    Data View (with overlaps)    and    Graphics View   . This can be done for the entire gene or for any particular product. In the Data View, a table is displayed showing information for each of the set of non-overlapping QGRS. This table displays the position of the QGRS, which exon/intron it appears in, its distance from 3    and 5    splice sites, the QGRS sequence (with each G-group underlined) and the corresponding G-score. Similar display is also shown for each QGRS mapped to poly(A) region in the product. If the user requests the Data View for the entire gene, then the QGRS information is shown for each product. The    Data View (with overlaps)    gives the same information but shows the locations of all QGRS. Figure 3 shows the Data View for product 1 of the GREB1 gene. The user can also choose the Graphics View to give a visual display of the location of QGRS. This allows the user to see the location of QGRS relative to exons and introns (if that information is available). The Graphics View has the following components. A graphic display of the entire gene (showing the location of the exons). This display includes a sliding window that can be used to focus on any particular segment of the gene. This window may be dragged to the left or right to change position within the gene.A magnified view of the fragment of the gene within the sliding window.A graph showing the location of QGRS within the fragment, with each QGRS being displayed by a bar whose height represents its G-score.A vertical slider that allows the user to change the size of the window. This allows the user to zoom in or out on any part of the gene. The sliding window on the gene expands or contracts as one zooms in or out. It is possible to see the nucleotide sequence of the product at maximum zoom levels. The Graphics View for the entire gene shows the G-score graph together with an exon/intron map for each product. This allows the user to visually compare the location of QGRS for each product relative to that of splice sites. The Graphics View for the first product of the GREB1 gene is represented in Figure 4. The Graphics View for the entire GREB1 gene may be seen in the Supplementary Data. CONCLUSIONS QGRS Mapper is a user-friendly web-based server that provides computational tools for prediction of Quadruplex forming G-rich sequences in the nucleotide sequences identified or provided by the user. The program offers many options, including user-defined composition of the quadruplex. It can analyze DNA or RNA sequence provided by the user in the raw or FASTA format. The application also provides tools for searching and retrieving gene/nucleotide entries from a variety of NCBI databases. There are several options for data output format, including an interactive graphic module. Researchers interested in evaluating the ability of nucleotide sequences to form unimolecular G-quadruplexes will find QGRS Mapper to be very useful. Owing to the flexible and comprehensive nature of the design, it is expected to serve a variety of scientists. The application will be especially attractive to individuals interested in exploring the role of G-quadruplexes in regulated RNA processing. We are using the server to perform a large-scale analysis of alternatively processed mammalian transcripts. We are particularly interested in studying the composition and distribution patterns of G-quadruplexes in the transcribed regions of mammalian genes.

1239921|t|Epigenetic inactivation and aberrant transcription of CSMD1 in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines
1239921|a|Abstract Background The p23.2 region of human chromosome 8 is frequently deleted in several types of epithelial cancer and those deletions appear to be associated with poor prognosis. Cub and Sushi Multiple Domains 1 (CSMD1) was positionally cloned as a candidate for the 8p23 suppressor but point mutations in this gene are rare relative to the frequency of allelic loss. In an effort to identify alternative mechanisms of inactivation, we have characterized CSMD1 expression and epigenetic modifications in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. Results Only one of the 20 cell lines examined appears to express a structurally normal CSMD1 transcript. The rest express transcripts which either lack internal exons, terminate abnormally or initiate at cryptic promoters. None of these truncated transcripts is predicted to encode a functional CSMD1 protein. Cell lines that express little or no CSMD1 RNA exhibit DNA methylation of a specific region of the CpG island surrounding CSMD1's first exon. Conclusion Correlating methylation patterns and expression suggests that it is modification of the genomic DNA preceding the first exon that is associated with gene silencing and that methylation of CpG dinucleotides further 3' does not contribute to inactivation of the gene. Taken together, the cell line data suggest that epigenetic silencing and aberrant splicing rather than point mutations may be contributing to the reduction in CSMD1 expression in squamous cancers. These mechanisms can now serve as a focus for further analysis of primary squamous cancers. Background CUB and Sushi Multiple Domains 1 (CSMD1) was cloned as a candidate tumor suppressor or progression gene from a region of human chromosome 8 deleted in tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract, prostate, ovary and bladder [1-7]. Deletion of 8p23.2 or reduced expression of CSMD1 has been associated with poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and in prostate cancers [2,5,8]. CSMD1, consisting of 70 exons spread over two megabases of 8p23.2, encodes a rare 11.5 kb transcript most abundantly expressed in the brain [1]. It is the founding member of a novel, evolutionarily highly conserved gene family whose proteins contain multiple domains thought to be sites of protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions and whose structure suggests that they may be transmembrane receptors or adhesion proteins [9,10]. Tumor suppressor genes are expected to be inactivated in cancers either genetically by mutations or epigenetically by modification of their promoters. While CSMD1 transcripts are detectable in upper aerodigestive tract epithelium, preliminary analysis of several head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines suggested that CSMD1 expression was lost in these lines [1]. Although the region containing CSMD1 is frequently deleted in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and prostatic adenocarcinomas [3,11-15], point mutations in the gene are relatively rare in primary squamous cancers [16] and in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (Schmidt, Richter and Scholnick, unpublished). Nonsense or splice junction mutations in CSMD1 have not been reported and not enough is known about the function of the protein to accurately assess the effect of the few missense mutations that have been detected. Thus, if CSMD1 is inactivated in tumors, alternative mechanisms for gene silencing must be operating. In this paper, we demonstrate that while most squamous cell carcinoma cell lines do not express full length CSMD1 transcripts, nearly all produce abnormal transcripts unlikely to encode functional CSMD1 proteins. Methylation of the DNA preceding CSMD1's first exon is correlated with reduction in the level of expression and cell lines expressing at low levels do not appear to elongate the full 11.5 kb transcript. Other anomalies of expression include incorrect splicing and the use of cryptic promoters. Our data suggest that activation of these promoters may result from the global demethylation of the genome associated with tumorigenesis (reviewed by Ehrlich [17]). Taken together these data demonstrate that mechanisms other than point mutation are responsible for the aberrant CSMD1 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, and these data suggest potential targets for further investigation in primary tumors. Results CSMD1 promoter methylation in HNSCC cell lines is correlated with expression levels Preliminary evidence suggested that CSMD1 expression is lost in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas [1] but that point mutations were rare [[16], and Schmidt, Richter and Scholnick, unpublished]. To date, only two of the 20 cell lines we have tested for CSMD1 expression, UPCI:SCC066 and PCI-13, express large transcripts initiated at the normal CSMD1 promoter. These data suggest that a mechanism(s) other than point mutation must be responsible for the loss of expression. CSMD1's first exon is embedded in a 3.7 kb CpG island (data from the UCSC genome browser [18]) suggesting that promoter methylation might epigenetically silence the gene. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed 32 head and neck cancer cell lines for CSMD1 promoter methylation using the Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) technique described by Xiong and Laird (Methods) [19]. COBRA analysis of the three amplicons diagrammed in Figure 1 suggested that 28 of the cell lines (87%) had more promoter methylation than did normal upper aerodigestive epithelium (data not shown). We selected nine of these cell lines for high resolution analysis of promoter methylation by sequencing of clones from bisulfite converted genomic DNA. This approach has the distinct advantage of allowing determination of the state of all the CpG dinucleotides within an amplicon on an allele by allele basis. Amplicons 1 and 2 have 19 and 20 CpG dinucleotides, respectively. Amplicon 3 could not be examined by this technique because it is unclonable after bisulfite conversion. The methylation data were correlated to CSMD1 expression levels as measured by quantitative RT-PCR using an amplicon spanning exons 1 and 2 (Methods). A pool of cDNA from five normal oropharyngeal epithelium specimens served as a basis for comparison to the cell lines. Our data from amplicon 1 demonstrate a clear relationship between methylation and the level of expression (Figure 2). The bisulfite sequencing data confirm that there is relatively little promoter methylation in normal tissue (clones 1-20, Figure 2A). This is also the case in cell line UPCI:SCC066 which expresses a large CSMD1 transcript from the normal promoter at a level approximately 33% of that of normal tissue (clones 32-39, Figure 2B). PCI-13, our highest expressing line at 125% of normal epithelium, displays two distinct patterns of promoter methylation with some clones heavily methylated (clones 21-24, and 30) and others with no methylation (clones 25-39 and 31; Figure 2B). This pattern is consistent with either heterozygosity for methylation or the co-existence of 2 distinct populations within the cell line, one heavily methylated and one unmethylated. We cannot distinguish between these two possibilities using the currently available data. The remaining cell lines express CSMD1 at a level half that of UPCI:SCC066 or less (ranging from 17% to 1% of normal epithelium) and they exhibit considerably greater methylation of amplicon 1 (clones 40-76, Figure 2C). Cell lines with more amplicon 1 methylation tend to express the gene at lower levels but the relationship is not strictly quantitative (Figure 2C). In contrast, our data revealed no relationship between expression level and methylation of amplicon 2 (located towards the 3' end of exon 1, Figure 1). For example, all of the 10 clones of amplicon 2 sequenced from PCI-13 were methylated at 19 or 20 of their 20 CpG dinucleotides. UPCI:SCC066, on the other hand, has nearly no methylation in amplicon 2 with only a single methylated CpG dinucleotide detected in one clone out of the nine sequenced. Amplicon 2 ranges from completely unmethylated to heavily methylated in the seven remaining cell lines (data not shown). Low transcript levels are accompanied by a failure to elongate the full CSMD1 transcript On the surface, the quantitative RT-PCR data presented in Figure 2 suggest that the cell lines we consider low expressing might still have up to 17% of the normal level of CSMD1 transcript. A survey of 20 cell lines using a battery of RT-PCR primer pairs located throughout the 11.5 kb transcript reveals that this is not the case. These lines included OKF6-TERT1, a TERT immortalized, p16 deficient but untransformed oral keratinocyte cell line [20]. Our data suggest that the low expressing cell lines shown in Figure 2C express considerably more of the 5' end of the 11.5 kb transcript than they do exons further 3', a phenomenon well illustrated by cell line PCI-100. This line expresses the exon 1/exon 2 amplicon at approximately 15% of the level of normal epithelium. In contrast, we had previously reported that CSMD1 transcripts were not detectable in this line by combined RT-PCR and Southern blotting using three sets of intron spanning primers [1]. The most 5' of those amplicons spans exons 9 through 26. Analysis with additional primer pairs resolves this apparent paradox by demonstrating that the amount of transcript declines sharply and reproducibly as one examines progressively more 3' exons (Figure 3). The same effect is seen using either oligo-dT or random hexamer primed cDNA. No transcript of this structure has been detected in normal epithelium nor have we detected any sequence alterations in PCI-100 that would explain why the full transcript is not expressed. It is not clear whether PCI-100 produces a small number of discrete size classes of transcript, if individual transcripts terminate at random points within the very large introns in this part of the gene (the first 10 introns average ~150 kb in length), or if the short transcripts result from the elevated activity of a previously undetected posttranscriptional control mechanism. Inactivation of CSMD1 by aberrant splicing Two cell lines, UPCI:SCC066 and PCI-13, express large CSMD1 transcripts initiated at the normal promoter. Subsequent finer scale analysis demonstrates that PCI-13's transcript lacks exons 4 and 5, resulting in a frameshift-induced nonsense codon in exon 6 (Figure 4). Sequencing of the PCI-13 RT-PCR product demonstrates the direct juxtaposition of wildtype exons 3 and 6 and that the transcript contains no novel sequences or splices that would prevent the frameshift. UPCI:SCC066 produces two transcripts, a normal one that includes exons 4 and 5 and another that lacks them (Figure 4). RT-PCR of human fetal brain cDNA reveals very low levels of an RT-PCR product corresponding in size to that expected from the internally deleted transcript. This band is not readily visible at the exposure used for Figure 4A. We have not detected a similar sized PCR product in RNA from oropharyngeal epithelium but this may reflect the fact that CSMD1 transcripts are ~10x less abundant in oropharyngeal epithelium than they are in fetal brain (data not shown). The transcripts lacking exons 4 and 5 appear to result from aberrant splicing rather than somatic deletion of these two exons or mutations of their splicing consensus sequences. Exons 4 and 5 can be amplified from PCI-13 genomic DNA and sequencing of those PCR products demonstrates that both their coding sequences and consensus splice sites are wildtype. Activation of cryptic promoters in cancer cell lines The RT-PCR survey revealed a second transcriptional anomaly exhibited by 4 cell lines: SCC9, 041, PCI-1 and PCI-2. Like PCI-100, these lines express low levels of the very 5' end of the transcript and even lower levels of more 3' exons within the first half of the transcript. However, these lines are distinct in expressing higher levels of the 3' half of the transcript, suggesting that alternative promoters in the middle of the gene may be used. SCC9 was chosen for further study because it expresses the 3' half of the transcript at a level dramatically higher than normal for oropharyngeal epithelium. Northern blotting detects a comparatively abundant 6.4 kb truncated transcript as well as smaller amounts of an 8.7 kb transcript in SCC9 (Figure 5A). The other three cell lines express their truncated CSMD1 transcripts at lower levels (data not shown). Sequence analysis of CSMD1 cDNA clones from SCC9 demonstrates that many transcripts are improperly spliced, resulting in retention of intronic sequences and/or deletion of exonic sequences (data not shown). In particular, retention of sequences from intron 40 is common. The high frequency of faulty splicing may explain the broadness of the 6.4 kb CSMD1 band in Figure 5A and suggests that the 8.7 kb transcript may also be incompletely or improperly spliced. 5' RACE [21] reveals that the SCC9 message is initiated just upstream of an Alu element in intron 36 (Figure 5B). Only the 5'-most 120 base pairs of the Alu element are present in the genome. RT-PCR using a forward primer specific for the novel sequences of the SCC9 transcript (prm1904, cgtttagttcgacacacttcatgt) demonstrates that cell lines 041, PCI-1 and PCI-2 do not initiate their CSMD1 transcripts at the same point, suggesting that other cryptic promoters are active in these lines. The sequence of this novel exon has been entered in Genbank as accession number DQ093422. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors activate the same cryptic promoter used in cell line SCC9 Expression from epigenetically silenced promoters can sometimes be restored by treatment with inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase or histone deacetylase activity ([22]). We selected two low expressing cell lines with promoter methylation, UPCI:SCC104 and 094, for treatment with various concentrations of 5-azacytidine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) as well as combinations of either of those drugs with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. These treatments did not reactivate the silenced CSMD1 promoter. COBRA analysis of genomic DNA from the treated cells suggested that the drugs did not robustly affect methylation of the CSMD1 promoter even at levels high enough to be toxic to the cells. These experiments did however shed light on the cryptic promoter used in SCC9 cells and on the interpretation of experiments using methyltransferase inhibitors. Treatment of cell line 094 with relatively high doses of 5aza-dC results in the expression of the 3' end of the CSMD1 transcript. This transcript was not detected in control 094 cells undergoing mock drug treatment (Figure 6) nor was it detected in 094 cells growing under normal culture conditions (data not shown). RT-PCR of cDNA from drug-treated 094 cells using the primer developed from the novel 5' exon of SCC9's truncated transcript (prm1904, see above) yielded a product identical in size to that amplified from SCC9 cDNA (Figure 6). The identity of the product was confirmed by DNA sequencing which also revealed that the drug-induced 094 transcript was more faithfully spliced than the transcript expressed in SCC9 (data not shown). Discussion Our data clearly demonstrate that expression of normal CSMD1 transcripts is rare in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. Of the HNSCC cell lines examined, only UPCI:SCC066 appears to express a normal transcript from the expected promoter. Even that cell line produces a second species of aberrantly spliced transcript lacking internal exons. Our data suggest that epigenetic modification of the DNA 5' of the transcription start site may contribute to the down-regulation of CSMD1. In addition, a low level of expression appears to be associated with production of prematurely terminated transcripts. This degree of complexity might be expected from a 2 megabase, 70 exon gene. Methylation of a specific region of the CpG island, -395 to -112 bp relative to the transcriptional start site (amplicon 1), appears to be correlated with the activity of the normal CSMD1 promoter. In contrast, methylation of amplicon 2, located within the first exon, shows no such relationship. Our data suggest that the relationship between the amount of methylation in amplicon 1 and the level of expression may not be strictly quantitative. Differences between cell lines with amplicon 1 methylation could arise through a number of mechanisms, for example, variations in the levels of transcription factors between cell lines. In cases where there is considerable heterogeneity in the methylation pattern within a cell line like PCI-100, alleles with less methylation may be expressed at higher levels than those more heavily methylated (compare clones 51 and 52 to clone 58 in Figure 2C). Alternatively, the presence of methylation in amplicon 1 could be a qualitative but not strictly quantitative indicator of methylation of a critical segment of the promoter not discovered in this study. The normal CSMD1 promoter was not reactivated by drugs that inhibit DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases, nor did the drugs abolish CSMD1 promoter methylation, even at toxic doses. Not all genes with promoter methylation respond to such treatments [23]. These drug treatments did, however, provide a potential explanation for the use of a normally cryptic promoter by cell line SCC9. The CSMD1 transcript in this line is initiated near a partial Alu element. 5-aza-dC treatment of cell line 094 activates the same cryptic promoter. This suggests that cryptic promoters may be naturally activated by general hypomethylation of the genome in cancer cells and the subsequent release of repetitive elements from epigenetic repression (reviewed by Ehrlich [17]). The SCC9 transcript does not appear to encode a functional protein but, with a very large gene like CSMD1, there is a potential for some abnormally initiated transcripts to encode truncated proteins with dominant negative properties. The second ramification of this finding is for the interpretation of data obtained by treating cells with methyltransferase inhibitors. Detection of CSMD1 transcripts solely with primers mapping to the 3' end of the gene could have been erroneously interpreted as representing reactivation of the normal promoter. It seems imperative that such experiments demonstrate that transcripts detected after drug treatment are actually initiated at the normal promoter. Aberrant splicing also appears to play a role in the production of defective CSMD1 transcripts. Loss of splicing fidelity has been proposed as a characteristic of cancer cells [24,25] and this would be consistent with the variety of misspliced transcripts we detected from SCC9. However, the removal of exons 4 and 5 from the CSMD1 transcript in PCI-13 may reflect a more specific phenomenon than a general inability to splice large introns; this line is still capable of splicing large introns as evidenced by its successful splicing of exon 3 to exon 6, eliminating an intron of over 666 kb. The failure to include exons 4 and 5 may be due to inactivation of a splicing enhancer in intron 3, or to less efficient splicing due to the fact that exons 4 and 5 do not begin with the consensus G residue (Figure 4B) [26]. Conclusion Taken together, our data suggest that CSMD1 function is lost in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines through a variety of mechanisms other than point mutagenesis. Epigenetic modifications of amplicon 1 and defective splicing appear to be fruitful areas to explore in primary head and neck squamous cancers. Methods Cell lines and tissue samples DNA from HNSCC cell lines UMSCC9, UMSCC35, UMSCC37, UMSCC38, UMSCC45, UMSCC49, UMSCC65, UMSCC68, and UMSCC76 was provided by Dr. Thomas Carey, University of Michigan [27]. Dr. Ruud Brakenhoff, Vrije Universitat, provided cell lines 040, 041, and 094 [28]; Dr. Theresa Whiteside, University of Pittsburgh, provided cell lines PCI-1, PCI-2, PCI-4B, PCI-13, PCI-30, PCI-50, PCI-51, PCI-52, PCI-100 [29], SCC4, SCC9 [30,31], and UPCI:SCC068, UPCI:SCC74, UPCI:SCC104, UPCI:SCC182, UPCI:SCC203, and UPCI:SCC220 [developed by Dr. Susanne Gollin, University of Pittsburgh, 32]. Dr. Gollin provided cell lines UPCI:SCC056, UPCI:SCC066, and UPCI:SCC114 [14,16,32]. The immortal but untransformed keratinocyte line OKF6-TERT1 was obtained from Dr. James Rheinwald, Harvard University [20]. Normal oropharyngeal epithelium was isolated from discarded tissue from uvulopalatopharyngoplasties (UPPP) collected anonymously with the approval of the Washington University Human Studies Committee. Cell Culture and Tissue Preparation Squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were grown in DMEM or DMEM:F-12, 1:1 Mixture (BioWhittaker) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). DMEM medium was supplemented with 1X MEM Nonessential Amino Acids (BioWhittaker). Upper aerodigestive tract epithelium was separated from the rest of the UPPP specimen by digestion with Dispase II (Roche) using a protocol adapted from Oda and Watson [33]. Nucleic acid preparation and bisulfite conversion Genomic DNA was isolated by using either Nucleospin Tissue kits (Clontech), QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kits (Qiagen) or Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Total RNA isolation, synthesis of first strand cDNA, RT-PCR and 5' RACE PCR were performed essentially as previously described [1]. Poly-A+ RNA for Northern blotting was selected from total RNA using Oligotex beads (Qiagen). Northern blotting and hybridization were performed as previously described [1]. cDNA synthesis was primed using oligo dT or random primers and extended by either Thermoscript or Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was run in Perkin-Elmer 480 or Applied Biosystems 9700 thermal cyclers for 35 cycles unless otherwise noted. Images of ethidium bromide stained gels were captured with a Gel-Doc imaging station (Biorad). Quantitative PCR was run in an Applied Biosystems 5700 thermal cycler using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers prm2426 (gtgtggagtatctgcagacatga) and prm2427 (ctggactaagcctccacagttct) were used to amplify a 132 base segment spanning CSMD1's first and second exons. An amplicon from human 18S RNA was used as a basis for comparisons across cell lines (primers prm2396, ttcggaactgaggccatgat and prm2397, tttcgctctggtccgtcttg). Calculations were performed using the DDCt method in GeneAmp 5700 SDS software (version 1.3) and Microsoft Excel. Quantitation was based on the average values obtained from duplicate reactions. The level of CSMD1 expression in normal oropharyngeal epithelium was determined from pooled cDNA from five UPPP specimens. We used the CpGenome DNA Modification kit (Intergen) for bisulfite conversion of the genomic DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol, with the following exception. Incubation of the conversion reaction was carried out in a thermal cycler for six cycles each consisting of three minutes at 94oC followed by three hours at 50oC (Christina Menke and Paul Goodfellow, personal communication). Analysis of CSMD1 Promoter Methylation Methylation of three segments of the CSMD1 CpG island was examined using the Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis technique (COBRA) [19]. All three segments were amplified by using the nested primers and PCR conditions listed in Table 1. Amplicon 1 extends from -395 to -112 bp, amplicon 2 from +175 to +396 bp, and amplicon 3 from +398 to +718 bp relative to the first base of the transcript. A small region surrounding the transcription start site (-111 to +174 bp) could not be examined because no PCR primers could be designed from its extremely GC-rich sequence. The first round PCR used 2 ul of bisulfite converted genomic DNA in a final volume of 10 ul. Subsequent amplifications with nested primers used 4 ul of first round product as template in reactions with a final volume of 20 ul. All PCR was carried out for 35 cycles. A portion of the second round PCR product was run on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and quantified using the ImageQuant software package (v1.2 for Macintosh, Molecular Dynamics) so that equal amounts of each could be used in restriction digests. Restriction digests for COBRA were performed with either BstU I or Taqa I (5 or 10 units per reaction, respectively; New England Biolabs) for 4 hours in a final volume of 10 ul. Taqa I digests were performed only when no methylation was detected with BstU I. BstU I digests also included an internal control DNA fragment to confirm complete digestion. This DNA fragment contains a single BstU I site and was amplified from a cloned CSMD1 cDNA using primers prm2020 (agatcccccagtgtctccctgtgt) and prm2021 (actgctggtgccgtggtaatgact). The control PCR product is 1019 bp long and is digested to two fragments of 605 and 414 bp by BstU I. Digestion products were fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with a Gel-Doc video imaging workstation (Bio-Rad). High resolution analysis of methylation was performed by sequence analysis of individual clones from amplicons 1 and 2. DNA from amplicon 3 proved unclonable and gel electrophoresis suggests that its very AT rich sequence results in a bent DNA configuration. PCR products were purified using the Nucleospin Extraction columns (Clontech) and inserted into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA from individual colonies was isolated using the Nucleospin Plus Plasmid Miniprep kit (Clontech) and sequenced with a reverse vector primer (agcggataacaatttcacacagga) using fluorescence based sequencing with Big Dye Terminator mix (Applied Biosystems). Treatment of cultured cells with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors Cell line 094 was treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5aza-dC) (Sigma) dissolved in DMSO. Two 100 mm cell culture dishes containing 5 x 105 cells were established for each of the drug concentrations tested. Cells were grown for 72 hours in media containing DMEM:F-12, 1:1 Mixture (BioWhittaker) with 1X MEM Nonessential Amino Acids (BioWhittaker) and 10% fetal bovine serum and then switched to media containing 5aza-dC at concentrations of 0 um, 5 uM, 25 uM, or 100 uM. Cells were fed daily for 4-5 days and then both plates were harvested in 3 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen) for isolation of RNA and DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR used for detection of CSMD1 transcripts in these treated cells was run for 40 cycles.

2327290|t|Borrelia burgdorferi membranes are the primary targets of reactive oxygen species
2327290|a|Abstract Spirochetes living in an oxygen-rich environment or when challenged by host immune cells are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS). These species can harm/destroy cysteinyl residues, iron-sulphur clusters, DNA and polyunsaturated lipids, leading to inhibition of growth or cell death. Because Borrelia burgdorferi contains no intracellular iron, DNA is most likely not a major target for ROS via Fenton reaction. In support of this, growth of B. burgdorferi in the presence of 5 mM H2O2 had no effect on the DNA mutation rate (spontaneous coumermycin A1 resistance), and cells treated with 10 mM t-butyl hydroperoxide or 10 mM H2O2 show no increase in DNA damage. Unlike most bacteria, B. burgdorferi incorporates ROS-susceptible polyunsaturated fatty acids from the environment into their membranes. Analysis of lipoxidase-treated B. burgdorferi cells by Electron Microscopy showed significant irregularities indicative of membrane damage. Fatty acid analysis of cells treated with lipoxidase indicated that host-derived linoleic acid had been dramatically reduced (50-fold) in these cells, with a corresponding increase in the levels of malondialdehyde by-product (fourfold). These data suggest that B. burgdorferi membrane lipids are targets for attack by ROS encountered in the various stages of the infective cycle. Introduction Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, survives and proliferates in distinctly different niches, including its arthropod vector and various mammalian hosts. These    micro    environments provide their own distinct sets of advantages and challenges to B. burgdorferi. For example, during the initial stages of infection of the mammalian host, immune cells attempt to prevent B. burgdorferi from establishing an infection using several systems including those generating bacteriocidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) [e.g. superoxide radicals (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (OH)] and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [e.g. nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite] (Storz and Imlay, 1999). In order for B. burgdorferi to successfully colonize a new host and cause disease, they must overcome the challenges posed by the innate immune system including the deleterious effects of ROS/RNS compounds. The effects of ROS/RNS on cells have been extensively investigated. These highly reactive compounds have been shown to damage cellular macromolecules including DNA, proteins and cellular membranes. The damage to membranes can arise through either lipid or membrane protein damage. In eukaryotes, membrane lipids are a major target of ROS. Free radicals attack polyunsaturated fatty acids in membranes and initiate lipid peroxidation. A primary effect of this is a decrease in membrane fluidity which affects the physical properties of the membrane altering the function of membrane-associated proteins. Once lipid peroxides form, they react with adjacent polyunsaturated lipids causing an amplification of the damage. Lipid peroxides undergo further oxidation to a variety of products, including aldehydes, which subsequently react with and damage membrane proteins. However, in bacteria, it is assumed that lipids are not subject to the oxidative damage observed in eukaryotic cells. Only certain polyunsaturated lipids, such as linoleic acid and linolenic acid, are susceptible to oxidation (Gutteridge and Halliwell, 1990), and it is clear that most bacteria do not synthesize or incorporate these types of lipids in their cell membrane. Two notable exceptions are the photosynthetic bacteria which synthesize and incorporate significant levels of linoleic acid in their membrane (Tasaka et al., 1996) and Helicobacter pylori membranes which contain between 0.5% and 3% linoleic acid (Ursini and Bindoli, 1987). Instead, it has been shown that the most damaging effects of ROS in bacteria result from the interactions of H2O2 with    free    Fe2+ (Imlay, 2003), generating very reactive OH (Fenton reaction). Because of this reactivity, the effect on any given biomolecule will depend largely upon proximity to the target. Because Fe2+ localizes along the phosphodiester backbone of nucleic acid, DNA is a major target of OH. This reactive species can pull electrons from either the base or sugar moieties, producing a variety of lesions including single- and double-stranded breaks in the backbone and chemical cross-links to other molecules. These strand breaks and other lesions block DNA replication and contribute to OH toxicity and cell death. Other base damage, which does not hinder replication, may result in a significant increase in mutation rates. The intracellular biochemistry of B. burgdorferi suggests that the primary cellular target of ROS may be distinct from that described in other bacteria such as Escherichia coli. In E. coli, the extent of DNA damage due to H2O2 and Fenton chemistry is directly proportional to Fe metabolism and the free Fe concentration within the cell (10 uM) (Keyer and Imlay, 1996). As the intracellular Fe concentrations of B. burgdorferi are estimated to be < 10 atoms per cell (Posey and Gherardini, 2000), it seems unlikely that DNA is a primary target for ROS. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the biochemical effects of ROS on B. burgdorferi, including growth effects and biological/physical damage. Results Effect of ROS on B. burgdorferi cells In order to determine what the cellular targets of ROS in B. burgdorferi are, we first needed to determine the sensitivity of Borrelia cells to various oxidants. Microaerobic cultures of B. burgdorferi strain B31A3 were grown to a cell density of 5 x 107 cells ml   1, treated with varying concentrations of H2O2 (0-50 mM) or t-butyl hydroperoxide (0-50 mM) and the number of surviving cells determined by plating. The results are shown in Fig. 1. When cells were exposed to 10 mM t-butyl hydroperoxide, approximately 50% of the cells survive (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when E. coli cells were exposed to 1 mM t-butyl hydroperoxide, approximately 1% of the cells survive. B. burgdorferi cells were much more resistant to t-butyl hydroperoxide than E. coli cells, with a survival rate of approximately 100% at 1 mM t-butyl hydroperoxide. This trend was observed when cells were exposed to H2O2. E. coli cells exposed to 1 mM H2O2 have approximately 10% survivability, while 100% of the B. burgdorferi cells survive at this concentration, and approximately 80% survive when exposed to 10 mM H2O2 (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained when cells were exposed in HN (Hepes-NaCl) buffer, suggesting that the high-level resistance to ROS was not due to the interaction of ROS with components of Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK-II) growth medium. Taken together, these data indicated that B. burgdorferi strain B31A3 was highly resistant to exposure to both t-butyl peroxide and H2O2. Borrelia burgdorferi DNA is not the primary target of ROS For most bacteria, DNA is the major target of ROS causing a wide variety of DNA lesions. This is in part due to the localization of    free    Fe2+ along the phosphodiester backbone of nucleic acids, putting the DNA in close proximity to the active species formed via the Fenton reaction. However, B. burgdorferi has been shown to harbour few genes encoding orthologues of known iron-containing proteins, does not require Fe for growth and has intracellular Fe concentrations estimated to be < 10 atoms per cell (Posey and Gherardini, 2000). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that B. burgdorferi DNA is not a major target for ROS. To test this hypothesis, different techniques were used to measure DNA damage in B. burgdorferi cells after exposure to ROS. One reliable indicator of DNA damage by ROS in a cell is an increase in the spontaneous mutation rate. In B. burgdorferi, mutations that confer resistance to coumermycin A1, which targets the b subunit of DNA gyrase, have been mapped to gyrB, the gene encoding DNA gyrase B (Samuels et al., 1994). In each case, a single point mutation correlated with this drug resistance. To determine if exposure to oxidants increases DNA damage by increasing point mutations, B. burgdorferi B31A3 cells grown under microaerobic conditions were treated with 5 mM H2O2 and plated in the presence and absence of 250 ng ml   1 coumermycin A1. The mutation frequency was calculated as the number of colonies that are CouR per total number of cells plated. The spontaneous resistance frequency of treated cells was approximately equivalent to that of untreated cells, 8.8 x 10   8 and 1.33 x 10   7, respectively, indicating no increase in the number of point mutations (Fig. 2A). Also, no increase in point mutations was observed when cells were treated with higher concentrations of H2O2 (10 mM) or when treated with t-butyl hydroperoxide (5 and 10 mM) (data not shown). Another effective way to determine DNA damage is by measuring the number of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites (AP). AP sites in DNA, where the DNA base is lost, can be generated spontaneously under physiological conditions by hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bond, or can also be formed by DNA-damaging agents (Lindahl and Nyberg, 1972), such as UV, alkylating agents or OH. They are also intermediates in the base excision repair pathway (BER) (Weiss and Grossman, 1987; Friedberg and Hanawalt, 1988; Wallace, 1988). Thus, the cellular steady state level of AP sites would increase as a consequence of base modifications and their subsequent repair. As AP sites are bypassed inefficiently by DNA polymerase in bacterial cells, DNA lesions can result in a significant block in DNA replication. Therefore, the number of AP sites can serve as a sensitive indicator of DNA damage resulting from oxidative stress (Kubo et al., 1992). To determine whether ROS can damage B. burgdorferi DNA, strain B31A3 cells grown under microaerobic conditions were treated with H2O2 (1 or 10 mM), t-butyl hydroperoxide (1 or 10 mM) or lipoxidase (an enzyme which specifically catalyses the hydroperoxidation of lipids containing a cis, cis-pentadiene structure, such as linoleic acid). The DNA was isolated and assayed for AP sites. The results are shown in Fig. 2B. In all cases, the numbers of AP sites per 105 bp DNA were equivalent, indicating that the addition of oxidants did not increase the number of DNA base lesions. In contrast, when E. coli strain TA4315 cells (ahpCF) (Storz et al., 1989) were treated with 100 uM H2O2, the number of AP sites increased  10-fold over untreated cells. These data suggest that B. burgdorferi DNA was not a major target for oxidative damage under these conditions. It is of note to mention that the total number of AP sites per 105 bp DNA is approximately 10-fold higher in untreated Borrelia B31A3 DNA than in untreated E. coli DNA. The Borrelia genome consists of a linear chromosome and multiple linear and circular plasmids. Numerous observations indicate that functional telomeres require interaction with DNA damage repair proteins, suggesting that the DNA damage repair machinery, including the BER, is involved in replication of telomeres and protection of functional chromosome ends (Verdun and Karlseder, 2007). An important intermediate in BER is the apurinic or abasic site. Therefore, it was possible that the higher numbers of AP sites in untreated Borrelia DNA was due to the number of telomeres present in the genome. The B. burgdorferi strain B31A3 harbours 11 linear plasmids and a linear chromosome with  100 unpaired bases in the telomere loops per genome or 10 bases per 105 bp DNA (Hinnebusch and Barbour, 1991; Chaconas, 2005). Untreated Borrelia B31A3 contains 11 + 3.8 AP sites per 105 bp DNA, suggesting that the elevated number of AP sites in Borrelia was due to the number of telomeres. To test this hypothesis, the AP sites were measured in DNA isolated from untreated B. burgdorferi strain B314 which harbours no linear plasmids (Sadziene et al., 1993). The number of unpaired bases in the telomere loops per genome was estimated to be 10, which corresponds to 1 base per 105 bp DNA, and only 3.6 + 0.2 AP sites per 105 bp DNA were detected, supporting the hypothesis that the high number of AP sites in untreated Borrelia DNA was due to the number of unpaired bases in the telomeres. The analyses of the AP sites strongly suggested that B. burgdorferi DNA was not the major target for oxidative damage. In addition to the generation of abasic sites, oxygen radicals often damage DNA through the formation of 8-oxoguanine lesions (Nakamura et al., 2000). 8-Oxoguanine, through its ability to mispair with bases other than cytosine, likely plays a role in DNA mutagenesis. Consequently, 8-oxoguanine is often used as a marker of oxidized DNA damage. To determine whether ROS can damage B. burgdorferi DNA and cause 8-oxoguanine lesions, strain B31A3 cells grown under microaerobic conditions were treated with H2O2 (5 or 10 mM), t-butyl hydroperoxide (5 or 10 mM) or lipoxidase. The DNA was isolated and assayed for 8-oxoguanine using an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay. The results are shown in Fig. 2C. In all cases, the amount of 8-oxoguanine in Borrelia cells was below the detection limit of the assay. In contrast, when a MutM (the specific glycosylase that removes the 8-oxoguanine)-deficient E. coli strain was treated with 100 uM H2O2, the amount of 8-oxoguanine sites increased  fivefold over untreated cells. It is important to point out that no MutM homologue has been identified in the genome of B. burgdorferi. Taken together, these data suggested that B. burgdorferi DNA was not a major target for oxidative damage under these conditions. The membranes of B. burgdorferi are targeted during oxidative stress In eukaryotes, membrane lipids are a major target of ROS. Free radicals can attack polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid and linolenic acid, in membranes and initiate lipid peroxidation. This reaction can cascade throughout the membrane to adjacent polyunsaturated fatty acids, decreasing membrane fluidity and generating more toxic products such as aldehydes (Imlay, 2003). Because most bacterial membranes contain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids rather than    reactive    polyunsaturated lipids, peroxidation of lipids in bacterial membranes is not considered a problem. As B. burgdorferi cannot synthesize their own lipids, they must instead scavenge them. Therefore, it seems likely that their membrane composition would reflect the host's lipid profile or that of their growth medium (Barbour, 1984; Fraser et al., 1997) and would contain some polyunsaturated fatty acids. To determine if B. burgdorferi contains polyunsaturated lipids, B. burgdorferi strain B31A3 was grown under anaerobic conditions and analysed for fatty acid composition by Lipid Technologies (Austin, MN). The results are shown in Table 1 and are reported as percentage of total fatty acid content. Linoleic acid comprised  10% of the total lipid content and the linolenic acid content was measured to be  1%, indicating that Borrelia cells do contain lipids that are susceptible to ROS damage. The amount of linoleic acid and linolenic acid present in Borrelia reflected the amount present in the media. Therefore, these results suggested that the amount of these fatty acids in the membranes would vary as availability varies. To determine if Borrelia polyunsaturated lipids can undergo lipid peroxidation, B. burgdorferi B31A3 cells grown microaerobically were treated with 1 mM t-butyl hydroperoxide or 250 mg of lipoxidase, and the cell pellets were analysed for fatty acid composition (Industrial Laboratory). The results are shown in Table 2 and are reported as the percentage of total cell mass. The per cent of linoleic acid in the total cell mass decreased with treatment, while the levels of oleic acid (c18:1n9) and pentadecanoic acid (c15:0) remained relatively constant. Untreated cells contained 0.04% linoleic acid, while cells treated with t-butyl hydroperoxide contained 10-fold less (0.004%) linoleic acid and cells treated with lipoxidase had no detectable linoleic acid present in the sample. These data indicated that the linoleic acid present in B. burgdorferi membranes can be oxidized by ROS. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is generated as a relatively stable end-product from the oxidative degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. MDA has thus been used as an indicator of lipid peroxidation (Gutteridge and Halliwell, 1990; Esterbauer et al., 1991). To further demonstrate that Borrelia lipids can undergo lipid peroxidation, B31A3 cells grown microaerobically were treated with 5 mM AAPH (free radical generator) or 250 mg of lipoxidase and MDA measured (Seljeskog et al., 2006). The results are shown in Fig. 3. Untreated cells contained  16.5 uM of MDA per mg of protein. When the cells were treated with AAPH or lipoxidase, the amount of MDA increased  1.5-fold (27.3 uM of MDA per mg of protein) and approximately twofold (33 uM of MDA per mg of protein) respectively (Fig. 3A). As a control, eukaryotic cells (mouse myeloma cells SP2) were treated with AAPH and MDA measured (Fig. 3B). Mouse myeloma cells have been used as a model system for the determination of phospholipid hydroperoxides (Chotimarkorn et al., 2005). In this case, the amount of MDA increased approximately threefold (36.3 uM of MDA per mg of protein) in the treated cells versus untreated cells (11.7 uM of MDA per mg of protein). Taken together, these data suggested that, like eukaryotic membranes, Borrelia membrane lipids were capable of undergoing lipid peroxidation. As shown in Fig. 3A, there is a measurable quantity of MDA present even in untreated cells, suggesting that the membrane lipids are damaged without the addition of exogenous ROS. Oxidative damage is an unavoidable by-product of growth in an oxygen environment because superoxide anions and H2O2 are formed whenever molecular oxygen chemically oxidizes electron carriers. To determine if the Borrelia lipids are damaged from growth in an oxygen environment, B. burgdorferi B31A3 cells were grown under anaerobic, microaerobic and aerobic conditions and MDA measured. Figure 3C demonstrates that as the oxygen concentration increased, the amount of MDA increased. Cells grown under anaerobic conditions contained the lowest amount of MDA (7.6 uM of MDA per mg of protein), approximately twofold less than the measured amount in microaerobic cells (16.5 uM of MDA per mg of protein). Aerobically grown cells contained the highest amount of MDA,  1.5-fold greater than that observed in microaerobic cells (28.8 uM of MDA per mg of protein) and  3.7-fold greater than that observed in anaerobically grown cells. These data suggested that Borrelia lipids can be damaged during aerobic growth. Our High Performance Liquid Chromatography analyses of the MDA present in anaerobically grown B. burgdorferi cells showed a small peak with a retention time similar to that of the MDA standard. This was puzzling as little or no lipid peroxidation should occur under these conditions. To further characterize this    MDA    peak, a three-dimensional diode array spectra was generated by scanning each sample during the elution of the peak (Fig. 4, lower sections). An authentic MDA standard was also scanned as a control (Fig. 4A, lower section). In the anaerobically grown cells, the spectrum shows that two compounds with different absorbance maximums (Fig. 4B, lower section) comprised the single retention time peak from the HPLC chromatogram (Fig. 4B, upper section). Based on this spectrum, the amount of actual MDA contributed < 15% of the total amount of material detected in the HPLC peak while the second contaminating peak contributed > 85%. Therefore, the amount of MDA in untreated anaerobically grown cells was considerably less than the 7.6 uM of MDA per mg of protein actually measured. However, in cells grown under microaerobic conditions, the MDA peak contributed more to the overall retention time peak when compared with the anaerobic spectrum, while the second contaminating peak stays relatively constant (Fig. 4C, lower section). These spectra demonstrated that the increase in the MDA retention time peak between anaerobically and aerobically grown cells was due to the increase in the amount of authentic MDA present. The fluorescent probe diphenyl-1-pyrenylphophine (DPPP) has been used for detection of lipid hydroperoxides in cell membranes (Okimoto et al., 2000; Takahashi et al., 2001). In this method, the hydroperoxides are reduced with DPPP, resulting in the formation of the fluorescent arylphosphine oxide. To visualize the lipid hydroperoxides, B. burgdorferi B31A3 cells were labelled with DPPP and observed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5B). E. coli Top10 cells and mouse myeloma SP2 cells were also labelled and visualized to serve as negative and positive controls respectively (Fig. 5A and C). Red Fluorescent dye was used to visualize the cell membranes. A strong fluorescence of DPPP was observed for B31A3 cells (Fig. 5B) and for the mouse myeloma cells (Fig. 5C), but not for the E. coli cells (Fig. 5A). An overlay of the two dyes demonstrates that the DPPP fluorescence of both the Borrelia and myeloma cells corresponds to the areas of red fluorescence. This indicated that lipid hydroperoxides were present on the Borrelia cell membranes and suggested that the membranes were damaged. To further demonstrate Borrelia membrane damage, B. burgdorferi B31A3 cells were grown under anaerobic and microaerobic conditions and visualized by negative stain using an electron microscope. Additionally, cells grown under microaerobic conditions were treated with 250 mg of lipoxidase and visualized by Electron Microscopy. Intact membranes were observed in cultures of B31A3 grown under anaerobic and microaerobic conditions (Fig. 6A and B respectively). However, in cultures treated with lipoxidase (Fig. 6C), a significant number of membrane blebs were seen surrounding the spirochetes, indicating membrane damage. Taken together, these data indicated that Borrelia membranes were a target for oxidative stress. Discussion Most bacterial pathogens are faced with the challenge of overcoming ROS generated by the host immune system. These radicals can cause a great deal of damage to biological molecules both in vitro and in vivo. The potential cellular targets for ROS damage in bacteria include DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids, and extensive work has been done to determine the cellular targets of ROS that affect bacterial survival. To date, the most definitive work has been done on E. coli. It seems clear from several studies that the most physiologically relevant target of ROS in E. coli is DNA. The exposure to uM concentrations of ROS (i.e. H2O2) is sufficient to cause DNA damage, inhibit DNA replication, increase the mutation rate and often lead to cell death. This process leading to DNA damage begins with formation of O2- and H2O2 from the oxidation of flavoproteins and/or the diffusion of these reactive species from the extracellular milieu. The subsequent oxidation of Fe-S proteins by ROS (e.g. O2-) leads to an increase in intracellular    free    Fe2+ which triggers the reduction of H2O2 to OH (Fenton reaction). The highly reactive nature of OH limits its diffusion so that it generally reacts with molecules in close proximity to its origin (e.g. the Fe2+ associated with DNA). In DNA, OH oxidizes sugar and base moieties, producing radicals which ultimately generate lesions, including base modifications, strand breaks and chemical cross-links to other molecules. Base modifications lead to mismatching and increased mutation frequencies while more severe damage, such as strand breaks, prevents DNA replication, contributing to OH toxicity and cell death. Critical to this chemical process in vivo is the presence of iron. No other metal or non-metal electron carrier appears to be able to univalently reduce H2O2 to OH in vivo (Macomber et al., 2007). These observations are critical in beginning to understand the oxidative damage/targets in B. burgdorferi. It has been shown in E. coli that the free-iron pool size determines the rate of oxidative DNA damage. For example, in wild-type E. coli, free iron levels are estimated to be 10 uM, yet H2O2 is only mildly genotoxic (Keyer and Imlay, 1996). However, in E. coli Fur- mutants, intracellular iron concentration increases eightfold while survival is 10-fold lower when cells are exposed to H2O2. Because B. burgdorferi cells do not contain detectable levels of intracellular Fe, it seems unlikely that DNA is a major target for damage via the Fenton reaction in this bacterium (Posey and Gherardini, 2000). The experimental data present in this report suggested that this was the case. When B. burgdorferi cells were exposed to high concentrations of ROS (e.g. H2O2), there was no effect on the spontaneous mutation rate (Fig. 2A) or the number of DNA lesions (AP sites or 8-oxoguanine) (Fig. 2B and C). It should be noted that in these experiments, a wild-type strain of B. burgdorferi was used and presumably all of the endogenous oxidative stress enzymes were expressed. Therefore, it is possible that no DNA damage was observed because these enzymes are capable of detoxifying the cell and protecting nucleic acids from oxidation via the Fenton reaction. However, we do not believe this to be the case as the concentration of oxidants used in these experiments were significantly higher than concentrations known to cause DNA damage in E. coli and other pathogenic bacteria. The lack of detectable DNA damage in B. burgdorferi cells under the conditions tested could be the result of very efficient DNA repair systems. Bacteria, such as E. coli, harbour genes encoding repair enzymes (i.e. MutM, MutY, Ung, AlkA, MutS, MutL, ExoIII, EndoVIII, PolI, RecJ). Key enzymes in the repair of 8-oxoguanine lesions resulting from the oxidation of DNA are the bifunctional glycosylases, such as MutM, MutY or EndoVIII. The first activity of these enzymes is to remove oxidized or ring-saturated bases while the second activity is to remove the resulting deoxyribose residue, generating a 3   -phosphate end (Krwawicz et al., 2007). This 3   -P is converted to a 3   -OH by various enzymes/pathways and the lesion is repaired by enzymes (e.g. ExoIII, PolI, LigI etc.) in the short or long BER pathways (S-BER, L-BER). Interestingly, the B. burgdorferi genome does not contain genes encoding homologues of MutM, MutY or EndoVIII, suggesting that it would be difficult for the cells to efficiently repair 8-oxoguanine sites using this pathway. B. burgdorferi does harbour the genes encoding the enzymes Ung (monofunctional gylcosylase, BB0053), MutS (BB0797, BB0098), MutL (BB0211), ExoIII (BB0114), PolI (BB0548), LigI (BB0552) and RecJ (BB0254) (Fraser et al., 1997) which are involved in excision and repair, via S-BER or L-BER, of deaminated, alkylated, methylated or mismatched bases. Clearly, these repair systems in B. burgdorferi do not seem as robust at defending against oxidation of DNA as those described in E. coli. The lack of key repair enzymes in this system may indicate that B. burgdorferi DNA is not subjected to the same challenge from ROS as is E. coli. In most bacteria, ROS-mediated damage to lipids (lipid peroxidation) is very unlikely because of the lack of polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g. linoleic acid) (Imlay, 2003). When it does occur, lipid peroxidation is initiated by the attack of free radicals on polyunsaturated fatty acids which decreases the membrane fluidity and, if these reactions propagate, lipid peroxides and their degradation products (e.g. aldehydes) in turn could damage proteins (Gutteridge and Halliwell, 1990). This would dramatically affect the function of transmembrane proteins and membrane-bound lipoproteins involved in the maintenance of membrane potential and solute transport, decreasing cell survivability. In contrast to most bacteria, B. burgdorferi membranes contained significant levels of unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid and linolenic acid, which were derived from the growth media (Table 1). Thus, it seemed possible that lipids and/or proteins rather than DNA are the primary targets of ROS in B. burgdorferi. When Borrelia cells are treated with oxidants, the levels of linoleic acid decreased while other fatty acids remain unaffected (Table 2). In addition, HPLC-based assays demonstrated that, as linoleic acid concentrations decrease, MDA (a toxic lipid peroxide intermediate) increased (Fig. 3). When these cells were examined by electron microscopy, damage to the membranes (membrane    blebs   ) was observed (Fig. 6). These data indicated that unlike most other bacteria, Borrelia membranes were damaged by oxygen radicals. As B. burgdorferi may be exposed to potentially harmful oxygen species at different stages of the infective cycle, the ability to protect its membrane lipids from ROS should be required for survival in the different host environments. In eukaryotic cells, where lipid peroxidation is a major consequence of oxidative attack, proteins which protect membranes have been well studied. For example, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, a member of the glutathione peroxidase family, has been identified in a variety of higher organisms. These enzymes are capable of reducing an assortment of hydroperoxy lipids, including oxidized phospholipids and cholesterol esters (Ursini and Bindoli, 1987), and protect complex membranes from oxidative damage. Much less is known about the enzyme(s) responsible for protecting unsaturated lipids from ROS in prokaryotes. In H. pylori, lipid hydroperoxide levels in ahpC mutants are approximately three times higher than in wild-type cells, suggesting a role for AhpC in reducing organic peroxides (Wang et al., 2006a,b). In addition, purified AhpC has been shown to reduce linoleic acid hydroperoxide in vitro (Baker et al., 2001). Because these antioxidant enzymes promote the in vivo survival of cells when challenged with ROS, enzymes for the reduction of lipid peroxides in Borrelia need to be identified. Interestingly, Borrelia cells grown aerobically showed signs of membrane damage similar to those observed in cells exposed to various oxidants. The amount of MDA in untreated aerobically grown cells was equivalent to that observed in treated cells (Fig. 3). Also, EM indicated that cells grown microaerobically or aerobically had significantly more membrane damage than cells grown anaerobically (Fig. 6). This indicated that Borrelia membranes can be damaged simply by exposure to physiologically relevant concentrations of dissolved oxygen. In exponentially growing E. coli, Imlay and Fridovich (1991) have shown that both O2- and H2O2 are generated by the autoxidation of components of the respiratory chain during oxygen metabolism. In contrast, B. burgdorferi is very metabolically limited and has no enzymes for the TCA cycle or respiration. Therefore, it seems more likely that sources of ROS are exogenous (e.g. innate immune response in the mammalian host) rather than endogenous. In addition, the current practice of growing B. burgdorferi under atmospheric oxygen could itself be unintentionally compromising cell integrity during in vitro manipulations. Analyses of the B. burgdorferi genome indicates that only a few genes encoding putative oxidative stress/intracellular redox proteins (SodA, NapA, BosR, CoADR, Trx and TrxR) (Fraser et al., 1997) are present, compared with other bacterial pathogens, including other pathogenic spirochetes (e.g. Treponema, Leptospira). Despite this apparent    deficiency    in the number of ROS-protective enzymes, B. burgdorferi cells appear to be able to cope with physiologically relevant levels of ROS. There are several factors that would contribute to this phenomenon: (i) as B. burgdorferi does not harbour the genes encoding respiratory enzymes nor metabolize oxygen, it seems unlikely that significant levels of ROS are generated via the incomplete reduction of O2 during cellular metabolism. This would suggest that potential ROS challenges to B. burgdorferi would come almost completely from extracellular sources with little contribution from intracellularly generated ROS; (ii) owing to a lack of understanding of the physiological conditions in vector and host tissues infected with B. burgdorferi, it is difficult to assess the levels and/or sites of the potential ROS challenge during the infective cycle and (iii) most importantly, analyses of the potential targets for ROS in B. burgdorferi strongly suggested that the major targets of oxidative damage are different and perhaps less extensive in this bacterium than in other bacterial pathogens (e.g. E. coli). Taken together, this suggests that B. burgdorferi would be innately more resistant to ROS and require a less extensive repertoire of enzymes to protect the cells from oxidative damage. Experimental procedures Strains, growth conditions and reagents Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31A3 and strain B314 (Sadziene et al., 1993) were grown in modified BSK-II (Barbour, 1984) medium at 34oC under an atmosphere of 0-20% O2 with 5% CO2 and the balance N2. Cells density was determined using a dark-field microscope. All reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO unless stated otherwise. E. coli strain Top10, strain TA4315 (ahpCF) (Storz et al., 1989) and CM1319 (mutM) (Bridges et al., 1996) were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) at 37oC with shaking. Per cent survivability assays Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31A3 was grown to a cell density of 5 x 107 cells ml   1 in BSK II under microaerobic (3% O2) conditions, the culture split and the cells treated with varying concentrations of oxidants (0-50 mM t-butyl hydroperoxide or H2O2) at 34oC for 4 h. After the incubation, cells were diluted in fresh BSK II, plated on BSK plates and incubated 7-14 days at 34oC. Per cent survivability was calculated as the number of colonies on the treated plates versus the number of colonies on the untreated plates. Determination of the spontaneous mutation rate To determine spontaneous resistance to coumermycin A1, B. burgdorferi B31A3 cells were grown under microaerobic conditions to a cell density of 5 x 107 cells ml   1 and treated with 5 mM H2O2 for 1 h at 34oC. The cells were plated on BSK plates containing 0 or 250 ng ml   1 coumermycin A1 and incubated 7-14 days at 34oC. The resistance frequency was calculated as the number of colonies that are CouR per total number of cells plated. Measurement of DNA base lesions Borrelia burgdorferi B31A3 cells were grown in BSK-II under microaerobic conditions to a cell density of 5 x 107 cells ml   1, treated with various oxidants (1 or 10 mM t-butyl hydroperoxide, 1 or 10 mM H2O2, 10 mM paraquat or lipoxidase) for 4 h and total DNA was isolated using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The number of base lesions was determined using the DNA Damage Quantification Colorimetric Assay kit (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 500 ng of DNA was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mM biotinylated aldehyde reactive probe (ARP) reagent and incubated for 1 h at 37oC. The DNA-ARP product was ethanol-precipitated using glycogen as a carrier, washed three times with 70% ethanol and resuspended in Tris-EDTA to give a final concentration of 0.5 ug ml   1. The DNA-ARP product was allowed to bind to the wells of 96-well microplate overnight at 37oC. After the binding, the wells were washed four times with TPBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na3HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, 0.5% Tween 20, pH 7.4). The HRP-streptavidin conjugate was diluted to 0.5 ug ml   1 in Assay Buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM NasHPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 5 mg ml   1 BSA, 0.1% Tween, pH 7.5), 100 ul was added to each well and the plate incubated at 100 r.p.m. for 1 h at room temperature (RT). After incubation, the wells were washed four times with TPBS, 100 ul of substrate was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37oC. The reaction was then quenched with 100 ul of 1 M sulphuric acid and the reaction was monitored at 450 nm. The number of aldehyde reactive probe (DNA base lesions) per 105 bp DNA was determined using a standard curve. As a control, E. coli TA4315 cells were grown in minimal media to OD600 of 0.4, treated with 0 or 100 uM H2O2 for 30 min and DNA isolated. The number of base lesions was determined as described above. B. burgdorferi strain B314 cells were grown under microaerobic conditions and DNA isolated. The number of DNA lesions was determined as described. To determine the amount of 8-oxoguanine in B. burgdorferi DNA, cells were grown and treated as described above and DNA isolated. The DNA was converted to single-stranded DNA by boiling the sample for 5 min followed by rapid chill on ice. The DNA was then digested with nuclease P1 for 2 h and then treated with alkaline phosphatase for 1 h following manufacturer's protocols. The resultant mixture was then centrifuged for 5 min at 6000 g and the supernatant used for the 8-oxoguanine ELISA assay (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI). As a control, E. coli CM1319 (mutM) cells were grown in LB to OD600 of 0.4, treated with 0 or 100 uM H2O2 for 1 h and DNA isolated. The concentration of 8-oxoguanine was determined as above. Lipid analyses To determine fatty acid content in B. burgdorferi total membranes, B. burgdorferi strain B31A3 was grown under anaerobic conditions to a cell density of 5 x 107 cells ml   1, harvested by centrifugation (5000 g, 15 min, 4oC) and washed two times with HN (20 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.6) buffer. Cell pellets were analysed for fatty acid composition by fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) gas chromatography (Lipid Technologies, Austin, MN) and results are reported as percentage of total fatty acid content. To determine the effects of oxidants on fatty acid composition, a 1.5 l culture of B. burgdorferi strain B31A3 was grown under microaerobic conditions to a cell density of 5 x 107 cells ml   1. The culture was split into 500 ml aliquots, the first was treated with 1 mM t-butyl hydroperoxide, the second with 0.25 mg of lipoxidase (17 700 units) and the third was untreated. All cultures were incubated for 12 h at 34oC. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 g, 4oC, 15 min) and washed three times with HN buffer. The fatty acids present in the cell pellets were analysed by FAME gas chromatography (Industrial Laboratory, Wheat Ridge, CO). Fatty acids were reported as percentage of total cell mass. Measurement of MDA Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31A3 was grown aerobically, microaerobically and anaerobically as described above to a cell density of 5 x 107 cells ml   1. The microaerobic culture was split and treated with either 5 mM AAPH [2,2   -azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride] or 250 mg of lipoxidase for 4 h at 34oC. To measure the amount of MDA, the cells were derivatized with thiobarbituric acid and analysed by HPLC as described by Seljeskog et al. (2006). After the incubation, all cells were harvested by centrifugation (1000 g, 5 min, 4oC) and washed three times with HN buffer. Each sample was resuspended in 50 ul of HN, mixed with 150 ul of 0.1 N perchloric acid, 150 ul of 40 mM thiobarbituric acid and 35 ul of 20% SDS, vortexed and heated at 97oC for 60 min. After cooling at    20oC for 20 min, 300 ul of methanol and 100 ul of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added and the samples were mixed vigorously and centrifuged (13 000 g, 6 min). The samples (10 ul) were then analysed with an Agilent Technologies 1200 series HPLC system using a C18 4.6 x 150 mm column with mobile phase 72:17:11 (50 mM KPO4, pH 6.8 : methanol : acetonitrile). Absorbance was monitored at 532 nm. Pure MDA standards (0-10 uM) were prepared in methanol for comparison. As a negative control, E. coli Top10 cells were grown to OD600 of 0.4, treated with 0 or 5 mM AAPH for 30 min and MDA measured as above. As a positive control, mouse myeloma SP2/O cells were cultured with HYQ-CCM1 (HyClone) medium at 37oC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, treated with 1 mM AAPH at 37oC for 4 h (Chotimarkorn et al., 2005) and MDA measured as above. Identification of lipid damage using Diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine fluorescent stain Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31A3 cells were grown microaerobically as described above until a cell density of 5 x 107 cells ml   1 was obtained. The culture was divided into two equal aliquots and the cells treated with 5 mM AAPH for 4 h at 34oC. After the incubation, all cells were harvested by centrifugation (1000 g, 5 min, 4oC) and washed three times with HN buffer. To visualize Borrelia cells, the cells were stained with PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Dye (Sigma Aldrich) following the manufacturer's protocol. To visualize the lipid hydroperoxides in the cell membrane, the cells were counterstained with DPPP (Cayman Chemicals, MI) (Okimoto et al., 2000). Briefly, after cells were stained with the Red Fluorescent dye, 2 ml of rabbit serum was added to stop the reaction and the mixture incubated for 1 min at RT. Next, 4 ml of HN buffer was added, the cells harvested by centrifugation (1000 g, 10 min, RT) and washed three times with HN buffer. The cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of HN buffer, incubated at 34oC for 5 min and 30 ul of 2.5 mM DPPP was added. The incubation was then continued at 34oC for 5 min in the dark. After incubation, the mixture was centrifuged (1000 g, 10 min, RT) and the cells washed three times with HN buffer. The cells were then resuspended in 100 ul HN buffer and observed by fluorescence microscopy with excitation wavelengths 551 nm (Red Fluorescent) and 351 nm (DPPP), and emission wavelengths 567 nm (Red Fluorescent) and 380 nm (DPPP). As a positive control, mouse myeloma SP2/O cells were cultured with HYQ-CCM1 (HyClone) medium at 37oC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, treated with 1 mM AAPH at 37oC for 4 h (Chotimarkorn et al., 2005) and stained as described above. As a negative control, E. coli Top10 cells were grown to OD600 of 0.4, treated with 0 or 5 mM AAPH for 30 min and stained as described above. Electron microscopy Borrelia burgdorferi cells were grown under microaerobic or anaerobic conditions to a cell density of 5 x 107 cells ml   1. The microaerobic cultures were split and treated with lipoxidase for 4 h at 34oC. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 g, 10 min, 4oC), washed and resuspended in HBSS (Lonza Group Ltd, Switzerland). The cells were fixed with Karnovsky's phosphate for 5 min at RT adsorbed to Formvar/carbon-coated grids (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) for 5 min and washed three times in H2O. The grids were stained with 1% ammonium molybdate and allowed to air-dry. Samples were examined using a Hitachi H7500 electron microscope (Hitachi High Technologies America, Pleasanton, CA).

2398786|t|Genomic-Bioinformatic Analysis of Transcripts Enriched in the Third-Stage Larva of the Parasitic Nematode Ascaris suum
2398786|a|Abstract Differential transcription in Ascaris suum was investigated using a genomic-bioinformatic approach. A cDNA archive enriched for molecules in the infective third-stage larva (L3) of A. suum was constructed by suppressive-subtractive hybridization (SSH), and a subset of cDNAs from 3075 clones subjected to microarray analysis using cDNA probes derived from RNA from different developmental stages of A. suum. The cDNAs (n = 498) shown by microarray analysis to be enriched in the L3 were sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic analyses using a semi-automated pipeline (ESTExplorer). Using gene ontology (GO), 235 of these molecules were assigned to    biological process    (n = 68),    cellular component    (n = 50), or    molecular function    (n = 117). Of the 91 clusters assembled, 56 molecules (61.5%) had homologues/orthologues in the free-living nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae and/or other organisms, whereas 35 (38.5%) had no significant similarity to any sequences available in current gene databases. Transcripts encoding protein kinases, protein phosphatases (and their precursors), and enolases were abundantly represented in the L3 of A. suum, as were molecules involved in cellular processes, such as ubiquitination and proteasome function, gene transcription, protein-protein interactions, and function. In silico analyses inferred the C. elegans orthologues/homologues (n = 50) to be involved in apoptosis and insulin signaling (2%), ATP synthesis (2%), carbon metabolism (6%), fatty acid biosynthesis (2%), gap junction (2%), glucose metabolism (6%), or porphyrin metabolism (2%), although 34 (68%) of them could not be mapped to a specific metabolic pathway. Small numbers of these 50 molecules were predicted to be secreted (10%), anchored (2%), and/or transmembrane (12%) proteins. Functionally, 17 (34%) of them were predicted to be associated with (non-wild-type) RNAi phenotypes in C. elegans, the majority being embryonic lethality (Emb) (13 types; 58.8%), larval arrest (Lva) (23.5%) and larval lethality (Lvl) (47%). A genetic interaction network was predicted for these 17 C. elegans orthologues, revealing highly significant interactions for nine molecules associated with embryonic and larval development (66.9%), information storage and processing (5.1%), cellular processing and signaling (15.2%), metabolism (6.1%), and unknown function (6.7%). The potential roles of these molecules in development are discussed in relation to the known roles of their homologues/orthologues in C. elegans and some other nematodes. The results of the present study provide a basis for future functional genomic studies to elucidate molecular aspects governing larval developmental processes in A. suum and/or the transition to parasitism. Introduction Parasitic nematodes are of major socio-economic importance in animals. For example, hundreds of millions of people are infected with geohelminths (soil-transmitted worms), such as blood-feeding hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and/or Necator americanus, Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris spp. [1], causing serious adverse effects on human health, particularly in children. Similarly, parasitic nematodes of livestock, such as pigs, also cause substantial economic losses due to subclinical and clinical diseases, with billions of dollars spent annually on the treatment and control of gastro-intestinal nematodes. In addition to the socioeconomic impact that these parasites have, there is potential for the emergence of resistance in them against all of the main classes of (nematocidal) compounds used to treat the diseases they cause [2]-[5]. Therefore, there is a significant need to work toward discovering new compounds to control these parasites. Gaining an improved understanding of the molecular basis of parasite development provides such an avenue. Compared with the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there is very little information on fundamental molecular aspects of development in parasitic nematodes [6]-[8]. Since the genome sequence of C. elegans was published in 1998 [9], many aspects of the molecular biology of this nematode have been elucidated. For instance, microarray analyses have been used to examine developmental and gender-enriched gene expression [10],[11], and the functions of more than 96% of the C. elegans genes have been assessed by double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi, or gene silencing; [12]) [13]-[18]. Comparative analyses of genetic data sets have shown that parasitic nematodes usually share  50-70% of genes with C. elegans (e.g., [19],[20]). There is similarity in other features (such as basic body plan and moulting) between C. elegans and parasitic nematodes, suggesting that some molecular pathways are relatively conserved [8],[21]. Understanding the pathways linked to basic nematode biology and development could have important implications for finding new ways of disrupting these pathways and thus facilitate the identification of new drug targets. Despite the advances in genomic technologies [7], [22]-[29] and the study of C. elegans, there is a paucity of information on the genomics of parasitic nematodes of animals, particularly in relation to development. Also considering the major socioeconomic impact of Ascaris and ascariasis in humans and pigs [30]-[32], several characteristics, including the large size of the adult worm (providing the opportunity of investigating individual organ systems and tissues), the ability to maintain Ascaris in the pig, store eggs and culture larvae in vitro for relatively long periods of time (months to years) [32] as well as the discovery that RNAi achieves    cross-species    gene silencing for a selected number of genes [33],[34] and the imminent genome sequence (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths/) all indicate that Ascaris could serve as a powerful model system for investigating reproductive and developmental processes in nematodes. In the present study, Ascaris from pigs was used to study molecules abundantly transcribed in the infective third-stage larva (L3). Following the oral ingestion of Ascaris eggs by the host (human or pig), L3s are released and then invade/penetrate predominantly the caecal wall [35] to then undergo hepato-pulmonary migration, after which ultimately the adult females and males establish and develop in the small intestine [36],[37]. The molecular mechanisms linked to host invasion and parasite development are largely unknown. Here, we constructed an L3-enriched cDNA library using the method of suppressive-subtractive hybridization (SSH), explored transcription of a representative subset of molecules by microarray analysis and conducted bioinformatic analyses to characterize these molecules, map them to biochemical pathways and predict genetic interactions based on comparisons with C. elegans and/or other organisms. Materials and Methods Production of Different Developmental Stages of Ascaris Experimental pigs (8-12 weeks of age) were purchased from and maintained in the Experimental Animal Center of South China Agricultural University. These pigs were treated humanely, according to the Animal Ethics procedures and guidelines of the People's Republic of China. Adult worms (males and females) of A. suum were collected from the small intestines of pigs from an abattoir in Shenzhen, China. Infective eggs and infective L3s of A. suum were produced according to the methods described previously [38]. In brief, eggs from the uteri of adult females of A. suum were collected and incubated at 28oC for 28 days to allow them to develop to infective eggs (containing infective L3s). To obtain pure infective L3s, 7.5% v/v sodium hypochlorite was used to treat the larvated eggs at 37oC overnight and then the eggs were shaken with glass-beads; then, the exsheathed L3s and shells were separated by density gradient centrifugation using lymphocyte separating medium (LSM) [38]. Following the experimental infection of helminth-free pigs with infective Ascaris eggs as described previously [39], the L3s from livers and in lungs as well as L4s in intestines were isolated according to an established method [40]. All parasite materials were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at    70oC. Construction of the cDNA Library by Subtractive-Suppressive Hybridization (SSH) Total RNA was isolated from adult females and males, different larval stages or eggs of A. suum using TriPure reagent (Roche) as recommended by the manufacturer. Equal amounts of total RNA from each stage or sex were pooled. The mRNA was isolated using the Oligotex mRNA Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. SSH was carried out using the PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, cDNA synthesized from mRNAs from infective L3s was subtracted against cDNA synthesized from the pooled mRNA from all other stages included herein. The SSH library was constructed using infective L3s as the tester and pooled cDNAs from all other stages as the driver. The effectiveness of this subtraction process has already been demonstrated in previous studies [41],[42]. The cDNA obtained following SSH was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy plasmid vector (Promega) and competent Escherichia coli (JM109) transformed. Positive clones, picked randomly (based on blue/white selection), were grown overnight in Luria Bertani (LB) medium (shaking, 37oC). Individual inserts were PCR-amplified using    nested primers    1 and 2R from the Subtraction kit (Clontech) and examined by agarose electrophoresis. Preparation of Microarray Slides Clones (n = 3075) from the subtracted library were picked and cultured overnight in LB containing ampicillin (1000 IU/ml) in sealed 96-well blocks. Five ul of culture suspension from each well were transferred into individual wells thermocycling (96-well) plates and the inserts PCR-amplified using primers 1 and 2R. Following a 10 min denaturation step at 94oC, the amplification proceeded for 25 cycles of 10 s at 94oC, 30 s at 68oC and 1.5 min at 72oC, with a final extension for 5 min at 72oC. Products were resolved in agarose gels, ethanol precipitated, re-suspended in 16 ul of    spotting solution    (Shanghai BioStar Genechip, Inc) to a final concentration of  500 ng per ul, before being printed on to glass slides (in duplicate) using a robotic arrayer. Sixteen blanks (using spotting solution only) and the same number of negative (irrelevant cDNAs with no relationship to Ascaris) were also printed on to slides and served as negative controls; b-actin of A. suum served as a positive control to assess the efficiency of labeling and hybridization. The slides were air-dried for 2 h, and cDNA in the spots were cross-linked at 254 mJ. The printed slides were stored at 4oC. Labeling of cDNA Probes with Fluorescent Dyes, and Microarray Analysis The cDNAs produced from total RNA from A. suum eggs, infective L3s, L3s isolated from pig liver or lung, fourth-stage larvae (L4s), adult males or females [as described in the section    Construction of the cDNA Library by Subtractive-Suppressive Hybridization (SSH)   ] were labeled with cyanine dyes. Cy3 or Cy5-dCTP was incorporated into cDNA produced from 30 ug of total RNA by direct labeling in a reverse transcription reaction using an oligo (dT) primer. Labeled cDNA was purified using DyeEx columns (Qiagen). Microarray slides were incubated with a pre-hybridization solution [5xSSC, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% sodium dodecyl-sulphate (SDS)] for 6 h at 42oC. After pre-hybridization, the microarray slides were incubated with    pooled    Cy3 and Cy5-labeled probes in hybridization solution (5xSSC, 1% BSA, 0.1% SDS), in the dark at 42oC for 18 h, and then washed in solution I (1xSSC, 0.2% SDS) for 10 min, followed by solution II (0.1xSSC, 0.2% SDS) for 10 min at 60oC, according to the protocols provided by Shanghai BioStar Genechip, Inc. A    dye flip    was carried out to control for any bias in hybridization signal between the Cy-labeled cDNA probes (produced for two distinct mRNA populations). The slides were dried and scanned (ScanArray 4000 scanner) using image acquisition software (Shanghai BioStar Genechip Inc.) and a range of laser power and photo-multiplier tube intensities. The mean hybridization signal (derived from four replicates of the same array) were corrected for background, normalized [43], log2-transformed and then subjected to statistical analysis employing the students t-test in a spreadsheet (Excel, Microsoft, USA). The microarray data were analysed for differential cDNA hybridization (>2.0-fold to 114.3-fold) between L3 and each of the other stages (eggs, lung and liver L3s, L4, adult female and adult male). Verification of Differential Hybridization by Reverse Transcription-Coupled Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Analysis For a subset (n = 17) of representative ESTs (rESTs), RT-PCR was used to verify the differential transcription recorded by microarray analysis. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (separately) from each stage or sex of A. suum using reverse transcriptase (Superscript III, Invitrogen). Briefly, 5 ug of total RNA were added to 14 ul of H2O and 1 ul of oligo d(T)n = 12-18 primer (0.5 ug/ul), heated to 70 oC for 10 min and chilled on ice. First- and second-strand cDNAs were synthesized via the addition of 4 ul of first-strand cDNA buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl and 15 mM MgCl2), 2 ul of 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and 1 ul of 10 mM of each dNTP, followed by an incubation at 25 oC (10 min), 42 oC (50 min) and 70 oC (15 min). One-tenth of each double-stranded cDNA produced was then used as a template in the PCR. The transcripts were amplified from individual cDNAs by PCR using oligonucleotide primers (sequences available upon request) designed to each EST. The PCR amplification of a portion (209 bp) of the b-actin gene (accession no. BI594141) using forward primer (5   -CTCGAAACAAGAATACGATG-3   ) and reverse primer (5   - ACATGTGCCGTTGTATGATG-3   ), previously determined to be present in all developmental stages and both sexes of A. suum [44], served as a positive control. Samples without template (no-DNA controls) were included in each PCR run. The following cycling conditions were employed: one cycle at 94 oC (5 min), 94 oC (30 s), 60 oC (30 s) and 72 oC (30 s) for 30 cycles, followed by a final extension of 70 oC (7 min). Following the PCR, 5 ul of individual amplicons were resolved in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels (2%) and then photographed upon transillumination. The relative band intensities were analyzed using UVIsoft Image Acquisition and Analysis software (UVITEC). The specificity and identity of individual amplicons were confirmed by direct sequencing using the same primers (separately) as employed for their amplification. Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analyses Clones from the SSH cDNA library with increased hybridization in microarray analysis to the infective L3 compared with other stages were sequenced using standard technology [45]. The nucleotide sequences have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers ES290984-ES291074. Following the processing of the sequences (i.e., removal of vector sequences, quality assurance and clustering), contigs or singletons from individual clusters were subjected to BLASTx (NCBI: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and BLASTn (EMBL-EBI Parasite Genome Blast Server: www.ebi.ac.uk) analysis to identify putative homologues in C. elegans, other nematodes and other organisms (e-value of <1e-05). Peptides inferred from ESTs were classified functionally using Interproscan (available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/) employing the default search parameters. WormBase (www.wormbase.org) was interrogated extensively for relevant information on C. elegans homologues/orthologues, including RNAi phenotypic, transcriptomic, proteomic and interactomic data. ESTs with homologues/orthologues in C. elegans and other nematodes were also subjected to analysis employing the KEGG Orthology-Based Annotation System (KOBAS) (www.kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn), which predicts the biochemical pathways in which molecules are involved. The open reading frames (ORFs) inferred from selected ESTs with orthologues in C. elegans were also subjected to    secretome analysis    using the program SignalP v.2.0 www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), employing both the neural network and hidden Markov models to predict signal peptides and/or anchors [46]-[48]. Also, transmembrane domains were predicted using the program TMHMM (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/; [49]-[51]), and subcellular localization inferred employing the program WoLF PSORT (http://wolfpsort.org/; [52]). The method established by Zhong and Sternberg [53] was used to predict the interactions for C. elegans orthologues of the L3-enriched molecules from Ascaris. In brief, interaction, phenotypic, expression and gene ontology data from fruitfly, yeast, mouse and human were integrated using a naive Bayesian model to predict genetic interactions among C. elegans genes ([45],[53]; Zhong and Sternberg, unpublished). The predicted networks resulting from the analyses were saved in a graphic display file (gdf) format and examined using the graph exploration system available at http://graphexploration.cond.org/. Images were labeled and saved in the joint photographic experts group (jpeg) format. Results To identify molecules transcribed abundantly in the L3 of A. suum, an enriched cDNA library was constructed by SSH. From a total of 3075 clones from this library, 2921 (95%) were shown to contain an insert (which could be amplified by PCR). From 2671 (92%) of these clones, amplicons representing single bands of  400 to 600 bp in size were produced. These latter amplicons were arrayed (in duplicate) on to slides and then hybridized with Cy3-labeled L3-cDNA or with Cy5-labeled cDNA from eggs, liver/lung L3s, L4s, adult female or adult male of Ascaris. Dye flip was conducted to verify the hybridization data. Of the 2671 (duplicate) spots, 1526 had a significant difference in hybridization between infective L3 cDNA and cDNAs from all other stages or sexes of A. suum, of which 515 had a >2.0-fold increased hybridization for the L3. In order to independently verify the hybridization results in the microarray, a PCR-based analysis of a selected subset (n = 17) clones was conducted using specific primer pairs. Having verified the specificity and identity of individual amplicons by sequencing, PCR results were reproducible (based on multiple runs on different days) and  94% (16 of 17) concordant with those of the microarray analysis (not shown). There was complete concordance for representative clones associated with a differential signal of >3.0-fold in the microarray. The clones linked to the 515 spots representing increased transcription (>2.0-fold) in infective L3 compared with the other developmental stages or sexes included were subjected to sequencing. The 498 sequences (length: 550+115 bp) determined were then subjected to detailed bioinformatic analyses. There were 91 unique clusters (accession numbers ES290984-ES291074), of which 55 were singletons (sequences determined once). Of 56 molecules (61.5%) with significant similarity to sequences other than A. suum in the databases interrogated, 50 (54.9%) had C. elegans or C. briggsae homologues, and six had similarity to ESTs already sequenced from ascaridoid and/or other parasitic nematodes, and/or other organisms (Table 1). A significant proportion (38.4%) did not have any similarity in sequence to any organisms for which data are presently available. Comparative analysis specifically against A. suum EST data sets (n 42,000) available in public databases confirmed independently that the majority of molecules (>60%) were present exclusively in the infective L3 stage or were orphans. As gene ontology (GO) provides a hierarchy that unifies the descriptions of biological, cellular and molecular functions [54], this approach was employed to predict the classification and gene function of molecules enriched in infective L3 of A. suum. A summary of the GO categories of these molecules is displayed in Fig. 1. Of the 91 contigs, 32 (35%) could be functionally assigned to    biological process    (n = 38),    cellular component    (n = 17) and    molecular function    (n = 64). The most common subcategories were gluconeogenesis (13%) and metabolic process (13%) within    biological process   , extracellular region (24%) within    cellular component   , and catalytic activity (11%) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity (8%) within    molecular function    (Table S1). A focused KOBAS analysis inferred the 50 C. elegans orthologues/homologues to be involved in apoptosis and insulin signaling (2%), ATP synthesis (2%), carbon metabolism (6%), fatty acid biosynthesis (2%), gap junction (2%), glucose metabolism (6%) or porphyrin metabolism (2%), although 34 (68%) of them could not be mapped to a specific metabolic pathway (Table 2). Of these 50 molecules, small numbers were predicted to be secreted (10%), anchored (2%) and/or transmembrane (12%) proteins (Table 2). Functionally, 17 (34%) of the 50 molecules were associated with (non-wild-type) RNAi phenotypes in C. elegans, the majority displaying embryonic lethality (Emb) (13 types; 58.8%), larval arrest (Lva) (23.5%) and larval lethality (Lvl) (47%) (Table 2). Extending this analysis, a relatively complex genetic interaction network was predicted for the 17 C. elegans orthologues (i.e., with non-wild-type RNAi phenotypes) (see Table S2). Statistically highly significant interactions were predicted for nine of the C. elegans genes; the top five interactors are displayed in Fig. 2. The gene ontology categories for eight selected C. elegans genes (F33D11.10, F55A12.8, kin-2, mec-12, mup-2, pab-1, rpl-22 and T21B10.2) included: embryonic development, egg hatching, larval development and/or growth. The other categories included: positive regulation of growth rate (F55A12.8, kin-2, mup-2, pab-1, rpl-22 and T21B10.2) and gamete generation and locomotory behaviour (kin-2, mup-2, pab-1 and F55A12.8, kin-2, mup-2, respectively). The C. elegans homologue egl-3 was predicted to be involved in proteolysis (see www.wormbase.org). All nine C. elegans orthologues were predicted to interact directly with a total of 296 (range: 5-75) other genes and, in particular, a direct genetic interaction was predicted between pab-1 and T21B10.2 (Fig. 2). The 296 interactors were associated with embryonic and larval development (n = 198; 66.9%), information storage and processing (n = 15; 5.1%), cellular processes and signalling (n = 45; 15.2%) and metabolism (n = 18; 6.1%); the precise function of some of the interactors (n = 20; 6.7%) is presently unknown (Table S2). Discussion The present study investigated transcripts in infective L3s of A. suum using a genomic-bioinformatic platform. The focus was on comparisons with C. elegans homologues/orthologues, because the entire genome sequence of this nematode is known [9] and because there is a wealth of information on the localization and functionality of its molecules (www.wormbase.org; http://elegans.bcgsc.bc.ca/knockout.shtml). The functions of most genes in C. elegans have been assessed using RNAi (e.g., [14],[15],[17],[55],[56]) in the hermaphroditic stage, whereas there is a paucity of functional information available for Ascaris and other parasitic nematodes of animals [57],[58]. Following the microarray analysis of >2500 ESTs from the SSH library, 498 cDNAs inferred to be enriched in the L3, based on hybridization signal, were sequenced and subjected to comprehensive in silico analyses. Of the 91 clusters of molecules categorized, 50 (54.9%) had C. elegans homologues/orthologues with loss-of-function phenotypes could be mapped to key pathways. The statistically significant genetic interactions predicted for 9 of the 50 C. elegans orthologues [namely egl-3, F33D11.10, F55A12.8, kin-2, mec-12, mup-2, pab-1, rpl-22 and T21B10.2 ( = enol-1)] and the interaction network included genes encoding kinases, alpha-tubulins, enolases, troponin and other named and unnamed proteins. Eight of these molecules (enol-1, pab-1, F33D11.10, rpl-22, F55A12.8 mec-12, mup-2 and kin-2) have known or predicted roles in embryonic and larval growth and development, gamete generation, locomotory behaviour or other biological processes in C. elegans (see www.wormbase.org). The enolase encoded by enol-1 is predicted to play a role in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (cf. [59]). Since glucose is the main source for ATP production, the alteration in these key glycolytic enzymes may lead to cellular dysfunction, such as impaired ion-motive ATPase required to maintain potential gradients, operate pumps and maintain membrane lipid asymmetry [60]. Bioinformatic analysis for transmembrane helices (TMHMM) and peptide signal sequences (SignalP) predicted ENOL-1 to be a non-secreted protein localized to the cytoplasm (cf. Table 2). Nonetheless, enolases are often detected in the excretory/secretory (ES) products of parasitic helminths, including adult A. suum [61], and appear to play a role in the triggering of nitric oxide production by host cells. The enol-1 orthologue of C. elegans has been predicted to interact specifically with the polyadenylate binding protein gene, pab-1, inferred to be involved in coordinated gene transcription and expression during normal larval development [16]. Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) are recognized to be central to the regulation of mRNA translation and stability [62]. Present evidence suggests that the expression of PAB-1 is regulated by an oligo-pyrimidine tract in response to cell growth and relates to coordinated growth regulation in C. elegans [62]. Furthermore, gene silencing of pab-1 and its selected interactors (see Fig. 2) leads to embryonic lethal (Emb), slow growth (Slo) and sterile progeny (Stp) phenotypes (see www.wormbase.org). Another gene (F33D11.10; EST code 4F10; see Table 2) which encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and is associated with embryonic lethal (Emb) and larval lethal (Lvl) RNAi phenotypes, was shown to be highly transcribed in infective L3s of A. suum. Helicases are involved in a variety of RNA metabolic processes, including translation initiation, pre-mRNA splicing, pre-rRNA processing, rRNA maturation and RNA degradation [63], and are crucial for life cycle progression, sex determination and early embryogenesis in C. elegans [60]. The high transcription levels of a homologue/orthologue in the L3 of A. suum might suggest a similar role in this ascaridoid. Similarly, the coordination of the expression of a large number of genes is required for normal growth and cell proliferation during larval development. The high transcription level for the ribosomal protein gene homologue rpl-22 (large subunit family member; EST code 26G12, see Table 2) in the infective L3 of A. suum compared with other developmental stages is likely to reflect the substantial rate of cell growth in this stage [64]. The gene (F55A12.8, EST code 4G11; see Table 2) encoding an acetyl-transferase with a putative ATPase domain, shown to be enriched in the L3 of A. suum, was predicted to interact with 75 other genes all involved in energy production and/or RNA processing (see Table S2). Several molecules involved in ATP synthesis and mitochondrial pathways (e.g., cytochrome oxidase c subunits 1, 2 and 3, ADP/ATP translocases, NADH dehydrogenases, ATPases and ATP synthetases) have been reported previously to be highly represented in the L3 stage of Anisakis simplex [65], thus supporting the proposal that substantial energy is required for larval development as well as the transition from the free-living to the parasitic stage and the invasion of the host. There is also likely to be a substantial energy requirement for muscle contraction linked to larval motility in A. suum, as the L3s penetrate the caecal wall in the porcine host, before undergoing hepato-pulmonary migration [35]. Accordingly, genes encoding a specialized tubulin expressed in mechanoreceptors (mec-12, EST code 13E09) and a troponin (mup-2, EST code 01G03; see Table 2), both predicted to interact with a total number of 32 tubulin- and myosin-encoding genes, also supported a link to extensive muscle contraction and motility in A. suum L3s. Also, neuroactive peptides are required to regulate the responsiveness of nematode larvae to mechanical stimuli [66]. A homologue encoded by egl-3 was shown to be highly transcribed in the L3 of A. suum; EGL-3 is predicted to be a pro-hormone convertase involved in the maturation of neuropeptides and could be associated with mechano-sensory responses and touch sensitivity linked to the host invasion. A regulatory subunit of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (kin-2, EST code 22H01; see Table 2) was predicted to interact with 72 other genes all involved in diverse cellular processes, such as nuclear trafficking, and DNA replication and repair (see Table S2). Based on gene ontology terms, kin-2 is implicated in gamete generation, growth, larval development, post-embryonic body morphogenesis, signal transduction and/or protein amino acid phosphorylation (see Table S2). Gene silencing of kin-2 in C. elegans leads to phenotypes, such as larval lethal (Lvl), larval arrest (Lva), body morphology defect (Bmd), dumpy (Dpy), uncoordinated (Unc) and sterile progeny (Stp) (www.wormbase.org), suggesting that its homologue in A. suum is central to larval maturation. The KOBAS analysis predicted the protein KIN-2 to be involved in the insulin-signaling pathway, previously implicated in controlling the exit from dauer in C. elegans and the activation of L3s of the canine hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum, following exsheathment [67]. In a recent study, Brand and Hawdon [68] were able to inhibit (with a phosphoinositide-3-OH-kinase inhibitor) the activation of infective L3s of both of the hookworms Ancylostoma caninum and Ancylostoma ceylanicum via the insulin signaling pathway, thus lending some credence to the hypothesis that this pathway plays an critical role in regulating the transition from the free-living to the parasitic stage [68]. Recently, it has been proposed that transcriptional and feeding responses to serum-stimulation in Ancylostoma caninum are regulated by parallel systems, with the insulin signaling pathway playing a significant role in the    resumption of feeding    in activated larvae [69]. Protein kinases are also likely to be involved in pathways linked to sexual maturation in developing larvae. As already proposed for adult stages of H. contortus [45], the protein kinase gene cdk-1 is predicted to play a pivotal role in the germline, oogenesis and spermiogenesis pathways of this parasitic nematode. Other protein kinases, such as PEPCK, and phosphatases, were shown herein to be transcribed at high levels in the L3 stage compared with other developmental stages of A. suum (see Table 2), which is in accordance to findings reported recently for Anisakis simplex [65]. Due to their major regulatory effects in eukaryotic signaling events and regulatory and sensory functions, protein kinases have been considered interesting targets for anti-parasitic drugs [70]. In conclusion, this study has given some interesting insights into early molecular processes in the L3 of A. suum. Approximately 60% of the transcripts enriched in the L3 stage of A. suum have homologues/orthologues in C. elegans. The bioinformatic analyses of selected molecules suggest that a complex genetic network regulates or controls larval growth and development in A. suum L3s, and some of these might be involved in or regulate the switch from the free-living to the parasitic stage. Some caution is warranted in drawing conclusions regarding molecular mechanisms regulating the transition to parasitism in parasitic nematodes from information on C. elegans, as latter is a free-living nematode. Also, while the method of data integration is essential for the reliable prediction of genetic interactions, it might limit the capacity of the approach somewhat to infer nematode-specific interactions. As additional datasets of genes and gene functions become available for various parasitic nematodes, more informed inferences can be made regarding the functions of nematode-specific genes, particularly those involved in the transition to parasitism. The imminent genome sequence of A. suum (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths/) should all assist in this endeavour. Also, functional analysis of selected molecules representing selected ESTs identified herein, utilizing gene silencing approaches established recently [33],[34], could provide some insights into developmental processes in Ascaris and related ascaridoid nematodes and provide avenues for the development of novel approaches for their control.

1075922|t|Tissue-dependent isoforms of mammalian Fox-1 homologs are associated with tissue-specific splicing activities
1075922|a|Abstract An intronic hexanucleotide UGCAUG has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of tissue-specific alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs in a wide range of tissues. Vertebrate Fox-1 has been shown to bind to this element, in a highly sequence-specific manner, through its RNA recognition motif (RRM). In mammals, there are at least two Fox-1-related genes, ataxin-2 binding protein 1 (A2BP1)/Fox-1 and Fxh/Rbm9, which encode an identical RRM. Here, we demonstrate that both mouse Fxh and A2BP1 transcripts undergo tissue-specific alternative splicing, generating protein isoforms specific to brain and muscle. These tissue-specific isoforms are characterized for their abilities to regulate neural cell-specific alternative splicing of a cassette exon, N30, in the non-muscle myosin heavy chain II-B pre-mRNA, previously shown to be regulated through an intronic distal downstream enhancer (IDDE). All Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms with the RRM are capable of binding to the IDDE in vitro through the UGCAUG elements. Each isoform, however, shows quantitative differences in splicing activity and nuclear distribution in transfected cells. All Fxh isoforms and a brain isoform of A2BP1 show a predominant nuclear localization. Brain isoforms of both Fxh and A2BP1 promote N30 splicing much more efficiently than do the muscle-specific isoforms. Skeletal muscles express additional isoforms that lack a part of the RRM. These isoforms are incapable of activating neural cell-specific splicing and, moreover, can inhibit UGCAUG-dependent N30 splicing. These findings suggest that tissue-specific isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 play an important role in determining tissue specificity of UGCAUG-mediated alternative splicing. INTRODUCTION Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is one of the fundamental mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression in higher eukaryotes (1,2). Developmentally regulated, cell type- or tissue-specific, and signal-induced alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs takes place in multicellular organisms throughout their lifetimes. Misregulation or abnormalities in pre-mRNA splicing, in some instances, leads to cellular dysfunctions found in human and animal diseases (3-5). Using various model systems of regulated alternative splicing, a number of pre-mRNA features that influence alternative splice site selection have been defined (1,2). These include enhancer and repressor RNA sequences located in exons and introns. Identification of RNA-binding proteins targeting these cis-regulatory elements is currently in progress. In vertebrates, participation of the SR family proteins and hnRNP proteins, such as PTB and hnRNPA1, in alternative splicing regulation via binding to the cis-regulatory elements have been shown in many tissue-specific splicing models (6,7). Although these RNA-binding proteins are ubiquitously expressed, their different abundance in different cells, differences in their post-translational modifications in different cellular contexts and their different abilities to assemble multiprotein complexes in different pre-mRNA contexts are thought to contribute to the determination of cell type-specific patterns of alternative splicing. For the last few years, tissue-specific and tissue-enriched RNA-binding proteins have begun to be identified as splicing regulators. These include brain-specific (or enriched) Nova-1, nPTB (brPTB) and some of the CELF family proteins (8-12). Discovery of these proteins has had a great impact on studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of alternative splicing regulation. One of the intronic cis-elements, which are involved in tissue-specific or differentiation stage-dependent regulation of alternative splicing, is the hexanucleotide UGCAUG. The importance of this element was originally recognized in fibronectin pre-mRNA by Huh and Hynes (13). Since then, alternative splicing specific to a variety of tissues or cell types, including neural cells, muscles, epithelial cells and erythrocytes, has been shown to be modulated via this element (14-21). Recently, Jin et al. (21) discovered that a zebrafish homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans Fox-1 (22) could bind specifically to the pentanucleotide GCAUG by in vitro selection from randomized RNA sequences. This pentanucleotide is almost identical to the hexanucleotide UGCAUG except for the first U. Moreover, the zebrafish Fox-1 homolog, as well as the mouse Fox-1 homolog, are capable of repressing the inclusion of an alternative cassette exon of the ATP synthase F1g pre-mRNA via binding to GCAUG, which mimics muscle-specific exclusion of this exon. This mouse homolog is identical to the ataxin-2 binding protein 1 (A2BP1), which has been previously cloned in humans and mice as the cDNA encoding a protein, which interacts with ataxin-2, the product of the causative gene for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (23,24). In addition to A2BP1/Fox-1, another mouse homolog of C.elegans Fox-1, Fxh, has been independently cloned as a cDNA, which is induced by androgen in motor neurons (25). Of note is that A2BP1/Fox-1 and Fxh share an identical RNA recognition motif (RRM) at the amino acid level. Therefore, two genes in the mouse genome encode homologs of nematode Fox-1. According to the names given by the first cDNA cloning, we used the nomenclature of A2BP1 and Fxh in this report. A2BP1 and Fxh have been named A2BP1 and Rbm9, respectively, in the human and mouse genomes. We have been studying regulatory mechanisms of neural cell-specific alternative splicing using the non-muscle myosin heavy chain II-B (NMHC-B) gene as a model system (14,26). NMHC-B mRNA is expressed ubiquitously. However, an alternative exon, N30, which encodes a 30 nt coding sequence, is included in the mRNAs from some neural cells, but is skipped in those from all other cells in mammals and birds (27,28). In cultured cells, a switch in N30 splicing from exclusion to inclusion can be seen in neural retinoblastoma Y79 cells during the post-mitotic and differentiated stages triggered by butyrate treatment. We have previously defined an intronic distal downstream enhancer (IDDE), which confers neural cell specificity on N30 inclusion, using this cell line (14). The IDDE includes two copies of UGCAUG. Mutation of these hexanucleotides results in N30 skipping in post-mitotic differentiated Y79 cells. In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of A2BP1 and Fxh in the regulation of N30 splicing. To this end, we have isolated cDNA clones for A2BP1 and Fxh from brain and muscles. cDNA cloning revealed the existence of tissue-specific (enriched) isoforms of both A2BP1 and Fxh. Of importance, different isoforms of A2BP1 and Fxh show different activities with respect to N30 splicing as well as different subcellular localizations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Database disposition The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited in the GenBank database with accession numbers AY659951 (F011), AY659952 (F411), AY659953 (F402), AY659954 (A016), AY659955 (A030), AY659956 (A713), AY659957 (A715) and AY659958 (A704). RNA preparation and RT-PCR Total RNAs were isolated from mouse tissues and cultured cells using an RNA isolation kit (Stratagene) or an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). To obtain the full-length coding regions of cDNAs for Fxh and A2BP1, RT-PCRs were performed using Superscript II RNase H    reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR primers used to obtain all Fxh cDNAs were 5   -ctcaggcctccactagttATGGAGAAAAAGAAAATGGTAACTC-3    and 5   -ctcaggcctcctctagaaGTAGGGGGCAAATCGGCTGTA-3   . The upstream primers for the brain (A016 and A030) and muscle (A713, A715 and A704) A2BP1 cDNAs were 5   -ctcaggcctccactagtgATGAATTGTGAAAGAGAGCAGCT-3    and 5   -ctcaggcctccactagtcATGTTGGCGTCGCAAGGAGTCC-3   , respectively, and the downstream primer for all A2BP1 cDNAs was 5   -ctcaggcctcctctagagATATGGAGCAAAACGGTTGTATCC-3   . Lower case letters represent adapter sequences including restriction enzyme sites. 5    Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using Marathon-Ready cDNA (BD Biosciences Clontech). For the analysis of minigene and NMHC-B mRNAs, RT-PCRs were performed as described previously (14,26). Sequences of primers P1-P9 shown in Figures 1, 4 and 6 are as follows: P1, 5   -AATTCACCCAGCAACCAGAAT-3   ; P2, 5   -TAGAGGGATGTAAGTGTTGATGCC-3   ; P3, 5   -CAGAGGGCGGACAGTGTATGGT-3   ; P4, 5   -GGCGGCAGGGGCGAGGGCAT-3   ; P5, 5   -CCGTGGTCGCACCGTGTACAAC-3   ; P6, 5   -CAGCGGCAGTGGCAGGGGTG-3   ; P7, 5   -AGGAAGAAAGGACCATAATATTCC-3   ; P8, 5   -CCTCCACCCAGCTCCAGTTGT-3   ; and P9, 5   -CCTGTAGTTATTAAATCCTTCAAG-3   . Preparation of expression constructs and minigenes The cDNAs of Fxh and A2BP1 were introduced into a plasmid pCS3 + MT, which contains a myc-epitope, and its modified version pCS3 + MT + NLS, which in addition contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the SV40 large T antigen (26). Minigenes G, J without the IDDE, and H with the wild-type IDDE are the same as minigenes W, D4 and Cm0, respectively in ref. (14). The 201 nt IDDEs with mutations were generated by recombinant PCR using the appropriate primers, which included mutated sequences. The hexanucleotide TGCATG sequences at the 5    and 3    sides were changed to GTTACT and ACCTAC, respectively. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay Template DNAs for in vitro RNA transcription were prepared by PCR using the wild-type and mutant IDDEs in the minigenes as templates and an upstream primer that included the T7 promoter sequence at the 5    end. The probe and competitor RNAs were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [a-32P]UTP and a trace amount of [35S]UTPaS, respectively, using a MAXIscript kit (Ambion). Mole concentrations of synthesized RNAs were estimated by radioactivities. Fxh and A2BP1 proteins with a myc tag were synthesized in vitro by using a TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) from pCS3 + MT constructs, which include the SP6 promoter. Binding reactions were carried out in a 10 ul mixture that contains 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 ug tRNA, 1 ul reticulocyte lysate reaction mixture and 15 fmol of probe, on ice for 20-30 min. An aliquot of 5 ug of heparin was added to the reaction 10 min before gel electrophoresis. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel using a 0.5x TBE buffer (Invitrogen). Cell culture and transfection The human retinoblastoma cell line Y79 was cultured and transfected with DNAs as described previously (14,26). Total amounts of transfected DNAs were adjusted to be constant by addition of the empty vector. Either Lipofectin (Invitrogen) or Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used for the transfection. For stable transfection, the pCS3+MT expression constructs were co-transfected with a plasmid carrying a neomycin resistant gene and selected by 0.2 mM geneticin (Invitrogen). For differentiation of Y79 cells, cells were plated on the poly-d-lysine-coated plates and then treated with 2.0-2.5 mM sodium butyrate for 4-5 days. HeLa cells were cultured as described and transfected with DNA using Effectene reagent (14,26). Immunoblot analysis Samples that required both protein and mRNA analysis were split upon harvesting. Total cell proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted as described previously (26). The primary antibodies used are monoclonal antibodies to a myc-epitope (Invitrogen) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Clontech). Binding of antibodies was detected with the SuperSignal System (Pierce) or ECL (Amersham). Immunofluorescent microscopy HeLa or Y79 cells grown in a four-chamber glass slide were transfected as described above. Cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde 24-48 h after transfection, and permealized with 0.5% Triton X-100 then blocked with 5% goat serum. Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-myc (Invitrogen), rabbit anti-NMHC-B (29). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). DAPI was used for DNA staining. Specimens were mounted in ProLong antifed kit (Molecular Probe). The images were collected using Leica SP confocal microscopy (Leica). RESULTS Tissue-dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 and their subcellular distribution The A2BP1 mRNAs are detected almost exclusively in brain and striated muscles (heart and skeletal muscles) in adult mice, whereas the Fxh mRNAs are expressed in a wide variety of tissues with the highest expression in brain and heart [(21,25) and S. Kawamoto, unpublished data]. These expression profiles prompted us to characterize the mRNAs of A2BP1 and Fxh in brain and muscles. We have cloned cDNAs for two gene transcripts from brain, heart and skeletal muscles by RT-PCR and 5    RACE. The isolated cDNAs are schematically presented with genomic structures in Figure 1 (for amino acid sequences see also Figure 8). Both gene transcripts are found to undergo tissue-specific alternative splicing. In both cases, brain and striated muscles express unique splice variants generated by mutually exclusive splicing of exons B40 and M43, respectively, which provide different coding sequences in the middle of the carboxyl half of the molecules. Southern blot analysis of the RT-PCR products of the Fxh mRNAs from the different tissues probed by oligonucleotides corresponding to B40 and M43 shows that M43 is exclusively used in heart and skeletal muscles, while B40 is predominantly used in brain (Figure 2A). Digestion of the RT-PCR products of the A2BP1 mRNAs with restriction enzymes unique to B40 and M43 demonstrates that B40 and M43 are used almost exclusively in brain and muscles, respectively (Figure 2B). A2BP1 contains an additional cassette type alternative exon A53, consisting of 53 nt. Inclusion and exclusion of exon A53 results in two different amino acid sequences at the C-terminal region owing to a frame shift. In the case of the A2BP1 gene, moreover, it appears that brain and striated muscle utilize alternative promoters, resulting in different amino acid sequences at the N-terminus. The 5    RACE of skeletal muscle mRNAs yielded essentially a single species of sequence with 29 unique N-terminal amino acids. The 5    RACE using brain mRNAs; however, yielded multiple products with multiple deduced amino acid sequences, all of which differ from the muscle amino acid sequence at the very N-terminus. Here, we focus our analysis on a clone containing nine unique amino acids at the N-terminus, which was obtained most frequently. Exon-intron organization of Fxh and A2BP1 shows remarkable similarities and a RRM is encoded in four exons (Figure 1B). Of note is that the significant amounts of Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs from skeletal muscles are missing a part of the RRM by exon skipping. Typically, as shown in Figure 2C, they lack the 93 nt exon that encodes RNP1, one of the two most critical motifs of the RRM (30). Some of them lack almost the entire RRM (e.g. F402 in Figure 1A). To examine the subcellular distribution of each isoform of Fxh and A2BP1, myc-tagged proteins were transiently expressed in cultured cells and immunostained with an anti-myc antibody. Initially, HeLa cells were used to investigate subcellular localization, since these cells are more suited for these studies. Representative confocal images are shown in Figure 3A. DAPI and anti-NMHC-B antibodies serve as markers for nuclei and cytoplasm, respectively. As noted, the ratio of protein distributed between nuclei and cytoplasm differs among the proteins. All isoforms of Fxh have a predominant nuclear localization. The brain isoform of A2BP1 without the A53 exon (A016) localizes to both nuclei and cytoplasm, whereas the other brain isoform with the A53 exon (A030) localizes predominantly to cytoplasm with only a minimum being in the nuclei. The relative amounts of both muscle isoforms of A2BP1 (A713 and A715) are somewhat between the amounts of the two brain isoforms. These data are summarized in Figure 1A. The subcellular distribution of representative isoforms (F011, A016 and A030) was also examined in retinoblastoma Y79 cells, which were used as host cells for the transfection experiments in order to characterize splicing activities of Fxh and A2BP proteins (see below). Although Y79 cells have a spherical shape and have only thin cytoplasm, exogenously expressed isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 show a similar subcellular distribution as in HeLa cells (Figure 3B). F011 localizes predominantly to nuclei, A016 to both nuclei and cytoplasm and A030 predominantly to cytoplasm. Specific interaction of Fxh and A2BP1 with IDDE via a hexanucleotide UGCAUG Fxh and A2BP1 share an identical RRM and A2BP1 has been reported to bind specifically to the pentanucleotide GCAUG through this RRM (21). We have previously reported that the IDDE of the NMHC-B transcript, which is indispensable for the regulation of neural cell-specific cassette type exon N30 splicing, has two copies of GCAUG (14). Therefore, we investigated whether Fxh and/or A2BP1 bound to the IDDE. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out using labeled IDDE and in vitro transcribed and translated Fxh and A2BP1, which include a myc-epitope. Since all Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms, except F402 and A704, contain the identical RRM, representative isoforms were analyzed. The expression of F011 in reticulocyte lysate causes the formation of a RNA-protein complex whose migration shift distinguishes it from those of the control reticulocyte lysate (C in Figure 4B, lanes 3 and 10). The unlabeled wild-type IDDE competes with the probe efficiently for the formation of the specific complex C (Figure 4B, lane 4). On the other hand, the mutant mc (Figure 4A), which has a mutation in both copies of UGCAUG, does not (Figure 4B, lane 7). The mutant ma, which has a mutation in the hexanucleotide at the 5    side, shows less efficient competition, compared with mb, which has a mutation in the 3    side of the hexanucleotide (Figure 4B, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the nucleotides at the 5    side are more important than those at the 3    side. The presence of an anti-myc antibody, but not a non-specific antibody, inhibits the formation of the specific complex (Figure 4B, lane 8). Synthesis of the full-length F011 protein using a reticulocyte lysate and specificity of the myc antibody for the expressed protein are verified by immunoblot analysis (Figure 4B, lanes 11 and 12). A016 and A030 show essentially identical results to those with F011 (data not shown). These results indicate that Fxh and A2BP1 can bind to the IDDE and that the hexanucleotide UGCAUG is required for their binding. Fxh and A2BP1 enhance N30 inclusion in a UGCAUG-dependent manner To study whether Fxh and A2BP1 regulate neural cell-specific splicing via binding to UGCAUG, the Fxh and A2BP1 expression constructs were co-transfected into retinoblastoma Y79 cells with a number of the reporter minigene constructs, which include the wild-type or a mutant version of UGCAUG in the IDDE (Figure 4A). Minigenes H and J consist of the exons E5, N30 and E6 and their flanking introns with some deletions in the introns. The IDDE with or without mutations in the hexanucleotide is included or excluded between N30 and E6. As described above, each isoform of Fxh and A2BP1 enters the nucleus to a different extent. To see the effects of different proteins on N30 splicing itself, independent of their differential properties in nuclear localization, an exogenous NLS was added to the expressed proteins. Since Fxh and A2BP1 proteins contain the identical RRM, and F011, A016 and A030 all show the same UGCAUG-dependent binding to the IDDE in vitro, F011 and A030 were used for these experiments. Host cells Y79 at the proliferating stage exclude the N30 exon in  90% of the endogenous NMHC-B mRNAs (e.g. see Figure 6A, lane 1). As shown in Figure 4C, the mRNAs derived from minigene J exclude N30 without exogenous expression of Fxh or A2BP1 in Y79 cells, similar to the endogenous NMHC-B mRNAs (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 1-5). However, in the presence of exogenous expression of F011 and A030, the N30 inclusion is increased (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 7 and 12). The N30 inclusion is absolutely dependent on the presence of the IDDE (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 6 and 11). Moreover, mutation of either one of the two copies of UGCAUG (ma, mb) abolishes the inclusion of N30 (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 8-10, 13-15). In the context of minigene H, which contains shorter introns, the larger extent of N30 inclusion is induced by either F011 or A030 overexpression (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 7 and 12). The N30 inclusion of the minigene H mRNAs also depends on the presence of the IDDE (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 6 and 11). Mutation of both copies of UGCAUG (mc) results in a complete loss of N30 inclusion (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 10 and 15). The mutant ma shows stronger inhibition of N30 inclusion compared with mb (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 8 and 9). This observation is consistent with the competition experiments of the EMSA shown in Figure 4B, indicating that the 5    hexanucleotide is more important than the 3    hexanucleotide for binding of Fxh or A2BP1 to the IDDE as well as an activation of N30 splicing. Comparable amounts of F011 and A030 are expressed in each transfection as verified by immunoblots using an anti-myc antibody (Figure 4C, lower panel, lanes 6-17). Since minigenes J and H lack a portion of the intron between exons N30 and E6 and, therefore, the IDDE is located  100 nt downstream of N30, instead of 1.5 kb as in the native gene, we also analyzed the effects of Fxh and A2BP1 on the N30 splicing of the wild-type minigene G, which includes full-length introns among E5, N30 and E6 (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4C (right panel), both F011 and A030 are capable of promoting N30 inclusion, with F011 showing a higher activity (Figure 4C, lanes 16 and 17). Although A030 can promote N30 inclusion as efficiently as F011 in the contexts of the minigene J and H transcripts, it can do so less efficiently than F011 in the context of the minigene G transcript. Interpretation of this observation will be discussed below. Taken together, Fxh and A2BP1 can activate N30 inclusion in an IDDE-dependent manner. The hexanucleotide motif UGCAUG is indispensable for this activation. Differential activities of alternatively spliced isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 in promoting N30 inclusion Both Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs are expressed in brain and A2BP1 is also expressed in striated muscles and Fxh is expressed in an even wider variety of tissues. As demonstrated above, however, both Fxh and A2BP1 transcripts undergo tissue-dependent alternative splicing, producing muscle-specific and brain-enriched isoforms. Therefore, the relative activity of individual isoform of Fxh and A2BP1 in promoting N30 inclusion was compared using minigene G. First, in order to evaluate the relative specific activity of each isoform in the splicing reaction separately from its ability to localize to nuclei, an exogenous NLS was included in the expressed protein to equalize the nuclear concentration of the expressed protein in these experiments. Essentially, all of the expressed proteins with the exogenous NLS are localized to the nucleus (data not shown). Therefore, the relative nuclear concentrations of the expressed proteins can be estimated easily by immunoblots. As shown in immunoblots in Figure 5A, similar quantities of proteins are expressed in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of the brain isoform F011 causes a dose-dependent increase in N30 inclusion and the extent of N30 inclusion reaches a plateau with  85% of the mRNAs including N30. In contrast, inclusion of N30 promoted by F411, the predominant isoform from skeletal muscles, reaches a plateau with only 40% of the mRNAs. With respect to A2BP1, the brain isoform A030 shows higher activity in N30 inclusion than the muscle isoform A715, which shows almost no activation, as shown in Figure 5A. Including additional isoforms, the activities of individual isoforms with an exogenous NLS in promoting N30 inclusion are shown in Figure 5B (lanes 8-13) and are also summarized in Figure 1A (nls). Special care was taken to ensure that a similar quantity of each protein was expressed and, if not, different amounts were tested to obtain comparable expression. In the presence of the exogenous NLS (nls), F011 and A016 show the highest activities among all isoforms tested. A30 shows a considerably lower activity than A016. Each of the muscle isoforms (F411, A713 and A715) has a lower activity than that of their brain counterparts (F011, A016 and A030, respectively). As expected, isoforms lacking a part or all of the RRM (F402 and A704) have no activity for N30 inclusion. Next, the splicing activities of the wild-type proteins without an exogenous NLS were examined. Representative data are shown in Figure 5B (lanes 2-7) and the relative activities are summarized in Figure 1A (wt). The protein amounts detected by immunoblots in these experiments represent the total amounts of the proteins distributed to both the nuclei and the cytoplasm. The splicing activities of the wild-type proteins are consistent with the activities that combine the splicing activities of the proteins with the exogenous NLS and the activities of the native proteins to localize to nuclei. In the absence of the exogenous NLS (wt), the brain isoforms F011, and A016 to a lesser extent, are still capable of activating N30 inclusion efficiently. The muscle isoforms for both Fxh and A2BP1 (F411, A713 and A715), as well as the brain isoform A030, show only minimal activities. Therefore, F011 and A016 appear to have the most physiological relevance to N30 splicing activation. Overexpression of Fxh and A2BP1 activates N30 inclusion of endogenous NMHC-B mRNAs The human NMHC-B gene consists of 41 constitutive exons and 3 alternative exons. Its pre-mRNA is  156 kb in length and it is much more complex than the pre-mRNA from the minigenes. In addition, the minigene pre-mRNAs are driven by a heterologous promoter. Therefore, we next examined if Fxh and A2BP1 were capable of promoting N30 inclusion of the endogenous transcript. Y79 cells were stably transfected with the expression construct for F011 or A016. Both F011 and A016 are enriched in the brain and show higher activation of N30 inclusion in the minigene transcripts. mRNAs encoding endogenous NMHC-B were analyzed by using RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 6, the inclusion of exon N30 with and without another alternative exon, R18, in the endogenous mRNAs is markedly increased in the clones which were stably transfected with the construct for F011 or A016 containing an exogenous NLS (Figure 6, lanes 4 and 5). Although to a lesser extent, transfection of the wild-type constructs without an exogenous NLS also results in a significant increase in N30 inclusion (Figure 6, lanes 2 and 3). Thus, exogenously expressed Fxh and A2BP1 are capable of activating N30 inclusion not only in the transcripts from the minigenes, but also in those from the native NMHC-B gene in Y79 cells. Fxh may cooperate with other factor(s) to promote N30 inclusion To address the role of endogenous Fxh and its potential interaction with other proteins in promoting N30 inclusion, we made use of an isoform of Fxh, F402, which lacks the RRM. The mutant proteins lacking an RRM for other RNA-binding proteins have previously been reported to function in a dominant-negative fashion and inhibit the activities of the wild-type proteins (26,31). Therefore, the effects of F402 on the N30 inclusion of minigene H mRNAs were examined in the context of the Y79 cells treated with butyrate. Upon butyrate treatment, as reported previously, Y79 cells enter in a post-mitotic and differentiated stage, and importantly, the endogenous as well as the minigene mRNAs in those cells include N30 to a large extent, unlike those in the untreated cells that predominantly exclude N30 (14). As shown in Figure 7, in the absence of exogenous expression of F402, large quantities of the mRNAs derived from minigene H-wt, which contains the wild-type IDDE, include N30 (Figure 7, upper panel, lane 4). In contrast, only small quantities of N30 inclusion are detected in the mRNAs from minigene H-mc, which has mutations in both copies of UGCAUG in the IDDE (Figure 7, upper panel, lane 8). Therefore, the butyrate-treated Y79 cells contain factor(s), which are capable of activating the UGCAUG-dependent N30 inclusion. Co-transfection of the wild-type minigene H-wt with the F402 expression construct causes a dose-dependent inhibition of N30 inclusion (Figure 7, lanes 1-3), indicating that F402 has an antagonistic effect on the endogenous factors with respect to N30 inclusion. Notably, the UGCAUG-independent N30 inclusion seen in the mutant minigene H-mc is not affected by the co-expression of F402 (Figure 7, lanes 5-7), indicating that the inhibitory activity of F402 depends on the UGCAUG element. The parallel experiment with the F011 expression construct does not show a significant effect on N30 splicing in either the wild-type or mutant minigene (Figure 7, lanes 9-16). This may be due to the fact that N30 inclusion of the wild-type minigene mRNAs has already reached a maximal level and is consistent with the idea that butyrate-treated Y79 cells contain sufficient amounts of protein(s) functionally equivalent to F011, which can promote N30 inclusion in a UGCAUG-dependent manner. Since F402 does not bind to the UGCAUG element, and has a UGCAUG-dependent antagonistic effect on N30 splicing, it most probably disrupts protein-protein interactions of the endogenous proteins that are required for the UGCAUG-dependent activation of N30 splicing. Endogenous Fxh (and/or A2BP1) would be a good candidate whose function could be antagonized by exogenously expressed F402. Thus, this observation suggests that the endogenous Fxh has an effect on the activation of N30 splicing and that other proteins cooperate with Fxh for N30 activation. Since muscle cells express the RRM-defective isoforms to a significant extent (Figure 2C) and the wild-type F402 localize to nuclei efficiently, this also raises the possibility that the RRM-defective isoforms may have an inhibitory function on the N30 splicing in muscle cells. DISCUSSION Two major findings are described in this report. First, Fxh and A2BP1 facilitate neural cell-specific inclusion of the cassette-type exon via binding to the specific intronic sequence UGCAUG. In addition to a minigene model system, Fxh and A2BP1 are capable of facilitating N30 inclusion of the endogenous pre-mRNA. This result provides an important demonstration of physiological relevance and supports the notion that the NMHC-B pre-mRNA is likely to be the true target for Fxh or A2BP1-mediated regulation. However, whether the endogenous Fxh or A2BP1 regulates endogenous NMHC-B pre-mRNA splicing needs to be determined in a future study. In vertebrates, small interfering RNAs and gene targeting strategies have recently been used successfully to address the roles of endogenous splicing regulators in alternative splicing of endogenous target pre-mRNAs (8,32-36). A second and more novel finding is the identification of tissue-specific isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 with different splicing activities as well as different subcellular localizations. This finding raises the possibility that the products of the Fxh and A2BP1 genes can contribute to a mechanism as to how tissue specificity of alternative splicing is achieved. Many splicing factors are detected not only in the nuclei, but also in the cytoplasm (37). They are shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and, in some instances, extracellular stimuli trigger changes in subcellular distribution of these proteins. Such translocations have been reported for hnRNPA1 and PTB (38,39). Moreover, a number of RNA-binding proteins have been demonstrated to play a role in multiple steps during gene expression in different subcellular compartments, such as pre-mRNA processing in nuclei, mRNA export from nuclei to cytoplasm and mRNA localization, stability and translation in cytoplasm (37,40). Therefore, not surprisingly, Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms were found to be distributed in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm in HeLa and Y79 cells. However, the relative ratios of proteins distributed between the two subcellular compartments at steady-state differ among the isoforms. In agreement with Jin et al. (21), substantial amounts of the brain isoform A016 are detected in nuclei. Other A2BP1 isoforms, the brain isoform A030 and the muscle isoforms A713 and A715, are only poorly detected in nuclei. This observation is consistent with the reports where endogenous A2BP1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells, hippocampus neurons and cardiac myocytes were shown to be localized essentially to the cytoplasm (23,24). Thus, inclusion and exclusion of A53 and differences in the very N-terminal sequences results in A2BP1 isoforms with a distinct subcellular localization. It is likely that A2BP1 proteins have multiple roles, involving both nuclear and cytoplasmic events. In contrast, all three Fxh isoforms predominantly localized to the nuclei. Therefore, in terms of their localization, Fxh proteins are better candidates for regulators of the pre-mRNA splicing that takes place in nuclei. Of note, however, our preliminary results of 5    RACE, as well as the EST database, detect multiple 5    end sequences for both Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs, which are presumably generated by alternative promoters and alternative splicing. The diversity of the 5    end cDNA sequences leads to the generation of a number of unique N-terminal amino acid sequences. Therefore, this study does not exclude the possible existence of other isoforms with different subcellular localizations for both Fxh and A2BP1. Our study also does not exclude the possibility that some of the isoforms translocate between the nucleus and the cytoplasm following stimuli. The main aim of this study is to determine the relative activities of tissue-dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 in neural cell-specific and UGCAUG element-dependent alternative splicing. To obtain an indication of the relative specific activity of each isoform in transfected cells, the same amounts of the expressed proteins should be available for the splicing reaction in the nuclei. For this reason, an exogenous NLS was included in the expressed proteins. Essentially, all of the expressed proteins with the exogenous NLS localized to nuclei. Thus, the amounts of the expressed proteins determined by immunoblots represent the nuclear concentrations. The analysis using the proteins expressed with the exogenous NLS allowed us to compare directly the splicing activities of these proteins. Furthermore, this analysis also allowed us to define the critical regions of the proteins for splicing activation. As shown in Figure 5, the splicing activities of the various isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 are intrinsically different, regardless of the subcellular localization properties of the wild-type proteins. Among the isoforms tested in this study, F011 and A016, which include B40, are found to have higher activities in promoting N30 inclusion. When the primary amino acid sequences, outside of the RRM, of these two proteins are compared, the C-terminal regions (amino acids 190-377 of F011) show a higher homology with 71% identity, whereas the N-terminal regions (amino acids 1-112 of F011) show only 53% identity. The C-terminal region includes four subregions of nearly identical stretches of amino acids (Figure 8, I-IV). One subregion (II) includes 13 amino acids encoded by exon B40. Substitution of this subregion with exon M43 in Fxh causes substantial changes in amino acid sequences resulting in only a 21% identity in this region between F011 and F411. Another subregion (IV) is located at the C-terminal end and A030 lacks this homologous region by the inclusion of exon A53, which results in a frame shift. Since F411 and A030 show poor splicing activation compared with F011 and A016, respectively, these two subregions of F011 and A016 appear to serve as activation domains, presumably by interacting with other proteins. This notion is supported by the finding that the RRM-lacking isoform F402, which includes the same subregions II and IV as F011, functions apparently as a dominant-negative mutant to the wild-type Fxh, consistent with the interpretation that the mutant and wild-type are competing to interact with other protein(s). To date, Fyn tyrosine kinase and estrogen receptor-a have been reported to interact with Fxh, and ataxin-2 with A2BP1 (23,41,42). Whether these proteins participate in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing is currently unknown. Of interest, A030 with the exogenous NLS activates N30 splicing as efficiently as F011 in the pre-mRNAs derived from minigenes J and H, which contain the shorter intron, whereas this isoform poorly activates N30 splicing in the pre-mRNA from minigene G, which contains the full-length intron. This observation implies that the interactions of A030 with different factors are required in the different pre-mRNA contexts. Therefore, the isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 described here may have different effects on other UGCAUG-regulated alternative splicing. The involvement of the hexanucleotide UGCAUG in regulated alternative splicing has been experimentally demonstrated in a number of neural cell-specific, as well as other tissue-specific, model systems (13-21). This hexanucleotide element plays a role, in most cases, as an enhancer in regulating alternative splicing of cassette-type exons as well as mutually exclusive exons. Furthermore, computational analysis has revealed that UGCAUG is over-represented in the introns in which splicing is regulated, compared with the constitutively spliced introns (43). This analysis also pointed to the UGCAUG element as playing a role in the regulation of tissue-specific alternative splicing in a wide range of tissues, but not in specific tissues. To date, KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) (44), A2BP1 (21) and Fxh (this study) are known to be capable of binding to UGCAUG. KSRP is expressed ubiquitously and tissue-specific variants of this gene have not been described so far. In this study, we have described the existence of tissue-dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1, which, while not identical in some areas of the molecule, may contain the same RRM. The physiological relevance of these isoforms is that they have different splicing activities and different subcellular localizations. The brain isoforms promote N30 inclusion more efficiently than the muscle isoforms of both Fxh and A2BP1. The isoforms lacking the RRM are normally expressed to a significant extent in skeletal muscles. This isoform is incapable of activating N30 splicing and, moreover, can inhibit N30 inclusion. The properties of these isoforms are consistent with Fxh and A2BP1 acting as regulators for N30 splicing, since N30 is included in neuronal cells, but excluded in muscles. Therefore, despite the tissue-independent occurrence of UGCAUG as a regulatory element, given the tissue-dependent isoforms of the UGCAUG-binding proteins (Fxh and A2BP1) with different activities, the hexanucleotide UGCAUG could confer tissue specificity on regulated splicing. One of the major problems in understanding the mechanisms responsible for alternative pre-mRNA splicing is the manner in which tissue specificity is determined. In vertebrates, to date, only a few tissue-specific proteins have been identified as splicing regulators (8-12). Here, we have shown that the tissue-dependent isoforms of the sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins, which themselves are generated by alternative splicing, have different activities in tissue-specific alternative splicing of target pre-mRNA. Therefore, these isoforms play a role in the determination of tissue specificity of target pre-mRNA splicing. The discovery of these tissue-dependent isoforms of the UGCAUG-binding proteins with different splicing activities adds an important new dimension to the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating tissue-dependent alternative splicing mediated via UGCAUG.

334876|t|The c1 genes of P1 and P7.
334876|a|Abstract The c1 genes of the heteroimmune phages P1 and P7 were sequenced and their products were compared. P7c1 expression was correlated with the translation in vitro of a protein whose predicted molecular weight (33,000 daltons) is indistinguishable from that of the P1c1 repressor. The c1 regions from both P1 and P7 were found to contain open reading frames capable of coding for a 283-amino acid protein whose predicted secondary structure lacks the helix-turn-helix motif commonly associated with repressor proteins. Two P1c1 amber mutations were localized to the 283-amino acid open reading frame. The P1c1 and P7c1 sequences were found to differ at only 18 positions, all but two of which alter the third position of the affected codon and do not alter the amino acid sequence of the protein. Plasmids expressing the c1 gene from either phage cause the repression of transcription from a cloned promoter situated upstream of P1c1.Images Volme 7 Nmbe 19198 Nulei Acds eserc The cl genes of P1 and P7 Francis A.Osborne, Sonja R.Stovall and Barbara R.Baumstark* Department of Biology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA Received July 11, 1989; Revised and Accepted August 29, 1989 EMBL accession nos X16005, X16006 ABSTRACT The cl genes of the heteroimmune phages P1 and P7 were sequenced and their products were compared. P7cl expression was correlated with the translation in vitro of a protein whose predicted molecular weight (33,000 daltons) is indistinguishable from that of the Plcl repressor. The cl regions from both P1 and P7 were found to contain open reading frames capable of coding for a 283-amino acid protein whose predicted secondary structure lacks the helix-tum-helix motif commonly associated with repressor proteins. Two Plcl amber mutations were localized to the 283-amino acid open reading frame. The Plcl and P7cl sequences were found to differ at only 18 positions, all but two of which alter the third position of the affected codon and do not alter the amino acid sequence of the protein. Plasmids expressing the cI gene from either phage cause the repression of transcription from a cloned promoter situated upstream of Plcl. INTRODUCTION The cl genes of the plasmid prophages P1 and P7 code for repressor proteins that are required for the establishment and maintenance of lysogeny (reviewed in 1). A protein corresponding to the Plcl repressor has been isolated and shown to be a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that recognizes several widely dispersed sites on the phage DNA (2-7). The consensus DNA sequence recognized by the Plcl repressor (ATTTATTAGAGCA[A/T]T) contains no discernable bilateral symmetry, a feature that is highly unusual among prokaryotic operator sites. P1 and P7 are heteroimmune; that is, each phage is able to establish a lytic infection on a lysogen of the other phage. In this sense, their relationship is analogous to that of phage X and 434, which differ in the DNA specificity of their cI repressor proteins (8). However, genetic studies indicate that Plcl and P7cl can be crossed into the heterologous phage without affecting the immunity specificity of the recipient (9). The basis for P1/P7 heteroimmunity has been localized to a second regulatory gene, c4, that is unlinked to cl. The c4 gene products prevent the expression of antireb, a closely linked gene that interferes with cl-mediated repression (10, 11). According to current models, P1/P7 heteroimmunity results from the inability of the c4 repressor of one phage to prevent antireb expression from the heteroimmune phage genome (10, 11). Because the cl genes of P1 and P7 are genetically interchangeable, it is anticipated that the two gene products carry out similar or identical regulatory functions. The studies presented in this paper were undertaken to investigate the biochemical basis for the apparent genetic identity of the two cl genes. In this paper, we present the DNA sequence of the cl genes of P1 and P7 and the predicted amino acid sequence of the cl repressor proteins. We report that Plcl and P7cl code for proteins of identical size (283 amino acids) and Nucleic Acids Research Volume 17 Number 19 1989 767 1 (r IRL Press Nucleic Acids Research nearly identical sequence. We report further that both repressors prevent the expression of a promoter located immediately upstream of the Plc 1 open reading frame, an observation that confirms their functional similarity and suggests an autoregulatory role for the two proteins. Analysis of the secondary structure predicted by the open reading frames does not reveal the characteristic helix-turn-helix (12) or other motifs commonly associated with DNA binding proteins. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial and phage strains. E. coli K336 is a SuO derivative of K140 (13). E. coli CB454 is a recA-, lacZderivative of K-12 (14). P1 + is described by Scott (13). P7+ is the strain of Smith (15), as described by Scott (16). P7cl. 1 contains a missense mutation in the cl gene (17). The P7 phage strains and the cl amber mutant phage strains PIci .245Cm, Plc1. 169 and P Ic .55 (11) were generously provided by June Scott. Enzymes and reagents. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase and polymerase, and the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase were purchased from Boehringer Biochemicals or New England Biolabs and reactions were carried out according to the manufacturers' instructions. DNA sequencing kits and in vitro transcription-translation kits were purchased from Bethesda Research Laboratories and Amersham Corporation, respectively. Synthetic oligonucleotides to be used as sequencing primers were prepared on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. Plasmid construction. pBRB7.2. pBRB7.2 (2) contains a 3.2 kb EcoRI/PvuII fragment from the cl region of P1 (Figure 1) inserted into the 2.3 kb EcoRIlPvuII fragment of pBR322 that contains the origin of replication and the f3-lactamase gene. pFA02. P7 plasmid DNA was digested with PvuII, ligated to similarly digested pBR322, and transformed into E. coli K336. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened for cl activity by cross-streak complementation analysis against P7cl.1 (18). pFAO2 contains a 3.5 kb insert of P7 DNA. The fragment was localized to the cl region of the P7 genome by Southern hybridization against P1 and P7 DNA that had been digested with BamHI and BglII (data not shown). pBRBJ69. 1 and pBRB55. 1. The PI cI open reading frame was previously localized to a 2.6 kb EcoRlIBamHI fragment derived from PlEcoRI-7 (2). This fragment also contains the wildtype allele for the conditional lethal mutation am43 (19, 20). To clone the cl reading frame from the amber mutant phage Plc1.169 and P Ic .55, we digested phage DNA with EcoRI and BamHI, ligated the digestion products into similarly digested pBR322, and transformed the ligation mixture into E. coli K336. Ampicillin-resistant, tetracyclinesensitive colonies were screened by cross-streak complementation analysis for their ability to support the growth of Plam43. Plasmid DNA isolated from complementation-positive cells was shown by agarose gel electrophoresis to carry plasmids containing the 2.6 kb EcoRIlBamHI fragment from the cl region. The cl mutant open reading frames were placed under the control of normal regulatory signals present in the cI region by digesting the cl.55 and cl. 169-containing plasmids with BamHI and PvuII and inserting a 601 bp BamHI/PvuH fragment containing the cl promoter region (2). The resulting plasmids, pBRB55.1 and pBRB169.1, respectively, contain the 3.2 kb EcoRllPvuIl fragment analogous to that present in pBRB7.2 (Figure 1). pBCB2. 13-2.18.

The dashed line reveals the approximate position of the cl gene (2). The sites of the -yb mutations introduced into pFA02 are indicated by asterisks. pFA02.16 and pFA02.26 contain insertions located 0.9 kb and 1.4 kb, respectively, from the PvuIl site at the left side of the map. The direction of the lacZ open reading frame in pBCB2.13-18 is indicated by the adjacent arrow. from the cI region of P1 into pCB192, a promoter-probe vector containing promoterless copies of lacZ and galK extending in opposite directions from a multiple cloning site (21). The source of P1 DNA for these constructions was pZHA3, a derivative of pBRB7.2 that contains a HindIlI linker at the single EcoRV site located about 200 bps upstream of the cl open reading frame (Figure 1). pBCB2.13 contains a 460 bp fragment of P1 DNA extending from the EcoRV site to a Bgll site within the cI open reading frame. pBCB2. 16 contains a 130 bp fragment extending from the EcoRV site to a BamHI site located about 100 bps upstream of the cl open reading frame, while pBCB2.18 contains the region extending from this BamHI site to the Bglll site within the open reading frame (Figure 1). The orientation of the P1 DNA fragments within these plasmids was confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. To test for the regulation of promoter expression by cl, we transformed pBCB2.13 and its derivatives into CB454(pBRB7.152) and CB454(pFAO2.152), two strains that express P7cl and Pll, respectively, from the pCB192-compatible kanamycin-resistant vector pDPT152 (22). Cells harboring both plasmids were selected by their resistance to both ampicillin and kanamycin. lacZ expression was measured by the procedure of Miller (23). pBRB7.152 was generated by introducing PlEcoRI-7 into pDPT152. pBRB7.152 has sustained a spontaneous deletion within the EcoRI-7 fragment that results in the loss of 2.5 kb of P1 DNA from the far left side of the P1 genetic map, but retains the 3.2 kb PvuHlEcoRI fragment required for cl expression that is present in pBRB7.2 (Figure 1). 7673 z I 011Z I e., Nucleic Acids Research Table 1.

(26). The plasmids were carried by E. coli K336. Cells were grown to mid-log phase at 370 in LB containing 50 tig/m1 sodium ampicillin and infected with Plcl.245 at a multiplicity of infection of 5 in the presence of 50 mM CaC12. After 10 minutes, non-absorbed phage were removed by centrifugation and the infection was allowed to proceed for 2 hours at 370. The infected cells were plated on LB plates containing 50 pLg/ml sodium ampicillin, 50 pLg/ml chloramphenicol, and 40 mM sodium citrate. The efficiency of lysogeny is defined as the number of ApRCmR cells at the end of infection divided by the number of ApR cells present at the start of the infection. To construct pFA02.152, we introduced a 2.8 kb EcoRV fragment of P7 DNA containing the cl gene (Figure 1) into the single EcoRI site of pDPT152 after it had been rendered blunt-ended by extension with T4 DNA polymerase. cl expression by cells harboring either pBRB7.152 or pFA02.152 was confirmed by measuring their ability to form chloramphenicol-resistant lysogens when infected with Plcl.245Cm. ,yb insertional mutagenesis. Insertional mutagenesis of P7cl was carried out using the 'yb transposon of F (24) as described by Devlin et al. (25). E. coli W1485(pFA02) was mated with the F- strain MX648 and subsequently plated on ampicillin (to select for the plasmid) and streptomycin sulfate (to select for the recipient strain). Transconjugants which could support only lytic growth upon infection by P7cl .1 (as scored by cross-streak analysis; 18) were assumed to have lost cl-complementing activity and were characterized further. The positions of two cl - insertional mutations, carried by pFA02.16 and pFA02.26, were identified by restriction mapping (Figure 1). DNA sequencing. DNA sequence analysis was carried out using the M13-dideoxy technique of Sanger et al. (26). Selected DNA fragments containing the cl wildtype or mutant genes were introduced into M13 mp8 or mp9. 18-nucleotide oligomers complementary to defined sequences within the cl gene were extended using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase in the presence of dideoxynucleotide triphosphates and analyzed by polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. The sequencing strategy is shown in Figure 1. RESULTS Localization of the P7cJ gene. Initial localization of the P7cl gene was undertaken by subjecting pFA02 to 'yb mutagenesis and determining the map position of inserts which destroy the ability of the plasmids to complement a P7cl - mutation (as determined by cross-streak analysis). pFA02 and the -yb insertion mutants were tested further by comparing their ability to complement a PIcI amber mutation with the complementation activity of plasmids containing cl genes isolated 7674 Nucleic Acids Research B C D E F G *.4 68 43 29- _ - =I = Am~ W _ 18 14 p Fig. 2.

The locations of the amber mutant codons in cl.55 and ci. 169 are indicated by small letters above the sequence. Sites for selected restriction enzymes (EcoRV [v]; BamHI [b]; Bgll [g]; EcoRP [e]; and NruI [n]) are illustrated by dashed lines beneath the sequence. The cl repressor binding site is underlined. Inverted arrows beneath the sequence illustrate the inverted repeat sequence upstream of the open reading frame. Predicted promoter ribosome binding sites are indicated by the presence of the consensus sequences above and below the line, respectively. The DNA sequences of Plcl from bp 1-134 and bp 1-434 were reported previously (2,5). mutant cl genes from either P1 or P7 (Table 1). The efficiency with which a cloned P7cl gene complements a PlcI mutation confirms previous genetic studies indicating that these two genes are functionally interchangeable (9). The location of the 'y6 mutations that destroy cl-complementing activity suggests that the P7cl open reading frame occupies a map position similar to that of the P1 open reading frame (Figure 1). 7676 Nucleic Acids Research Proteins produced by fragments containing Plcl. As an initial step in the comparison of the P1 and P7 repressors, we analyzed the gene products expressed from the cloned cl regions. In an in vitro transcription-translation reaction, plasmids coding for the wildtpe alleles of either PIcI or P7cl direct the production of a protein with an estimated molecular weight of 33,000 daltons (Figure 2, Lanes C and D), a size that agrees closely with the predicted molecular weight of the PIcI repressor reported previously (3,28). The loss of the 33,000 dalton protein in the cl - 'ya-induced P7 mutant plasmids (Figure 2, Lanes E and F) is consistent with its designation as the P7cl repressor. As expected, the 33,000 dalton protein is not observed when reaction mixtures contain DNA from Plcl amber mutants (Figure 2, Lanes A and B). DNA sequence analysis of the cl genes. To make a direct comparison between the Plcl and P7cl DNA sequences and to predict the amino acid sequences of the repressor proteins, we carried out M 13-dideoxy sequence analysis of cloned fragments carrying the cl genes. The sequences of about 1 kb of P1 and P7 DNA were determined starting from a common EcoRV site predicted to lie approximately 200 bps upstream of the cl genes. The P1 and P7 sequences (Figure 3) both contain an ATG initiation codon preceded by a putative ribosome binding sequence (29) situated 211 bps downstream of the EcoRV site. In each case, the initiation codon is followed by an open reading reading frame extending for 283 codons. The P1 and P7 open reading frames code for proteins with predicted molecular weights (32,515 and 32,499 daltons, respectively) that agree closely with the values of the proteins expressed from the cloned DNA fragments (Figure 2) and with results predicted independently for the purified PIcI repressor (3-4). The localization of two PIcI amber mutations to the P1 open reading frame confirms its identification as the cI coding sequence. cI. 169 contains an amber mutation that would result in a protein fragment of 26,680 daltons, a value that agrees well with the size of a protein fragment observed under the in vitro transcription/translation reaction conditions (Figure 2, Lane B). The cl.55 amber mutation lies close to the N-terminal region of the protein, resulting in the production of a fragment of 55 amino acids that is apparently too small to resolve under the electrophoretic conditions used for separation of the proteins. Over 60% of the amino acid sequence predicted for the PIcI open reading frame has been verified by amino acid sequence analysis of peptide fragments isolated from the purified repressor protein (see accompanying paper, reference 3). The DNA sequences of P1 and P7 are identical for a 399-bp region that extends from the EcoRV site at the 5' side of the cl gene to a point 188 bps within the open reading frame. The sequences within the Plcl and the P7cl open reading frames differ at only 18 positions, all but two of which occur in the wobble position of the predicted codon. From these results, we conclude that the functional identity of the P1 and P7 cl genes is a consequence of their nearly identical amino acid sequence. Analysis of promoters upstream of the cl open reading frame. Expression of Plcl was shown previously to require sequences on the distal side of a BamHI site (2, 5) located about 100 bps upstream of the open reading frame (Figure 3). A binding site for the cl repressor has also been shown to exist close to this BamHI site (2, 5, 6). To determine whether this region contains a promoter that is detectable in vivo and, further, to determine whether this promoter can be regulated by cl repressor proteins from either P1 or P7, we introduced several DNA fragments from this region into the promoter probe vector pCB192, screened for promoter activity (as monitored by lacZ expression) and checked for repression of this activity in the presence of a compatible 7677 Nucleic Acids Research plasmid expressing Plcl or P7cl. Cells harboring pBCB2.13 (a plasmid which carries a 460 bp fragment of P1 DNA that extends across the BamHI site upstream of cl into the open reading frame) are dark blue in the presence of Xgal and produce significant levels of 3-galactosidase (Table 2). In contrast, pBCB2.16 and pBCB2.18 (which each contain DNA from only one side of the BamHI site located in pBCB2. 13) do not confer a blue color on their host cell in the presence of X-Gal and express negligible amounts of 3-galactosidase (Table 2). These observations suggest that expression from the promoter identified here requires sequences that span the BamHI site upstream of cl. Expression of cl from a compatible plasmid in the presence of pBCB2. 13 results in a 90% reduction in promoter strength (Table 2). This reduction is seen in the presence of either Plcl or P7cl, indicating that the two repressor proteins are both capable of repressing expression from this promoter. DISCUSSION. The DNA sequences of Plcl and P7cl differ at only 18 sites, all but two of which occur at the third position of the affected codon. This observation provides biochemical confirmation of the functional identity predicted on the basis of previous genetic analysis (9). A number of DNA binding proteins exhibit a common structural motif in which two helices are separated by a glycine residue (12). This motif is not observed in the predicted secondary structures (30) of the Plcl and P7cl amino acid sequences. A sequence with some similarity to the XCro helix-turn-helix region was previously reported near the Nterminus of the PIcI protein (5); however, it was noted that the potential for helix formation is disrupted by the presence of several prolines within the region. The secondary structure predicted for the Plcl and P7cl repressor proteins (30) does not reveal other structural characteristics (e.g., Zn fingers (31), leucine zippers (32), or helix-loop-helix motifs (33)) that have been associated with DNA binding activity in other systems. A search of the GenBank and EMBL databases does not reveal any other known regulatory proteins with significant amino acid similarity to the Plcl or the P7cl repressor sequences. Since the Plcl repressor differs from most other repressors in DNA binding specificity (i.e., in its recognition of an asymmetric operator sequence), it is not unexpected to find that the protein does not exhibit common structural motifs at the amino acid level. The cl-repressible promoter described in this report is located in a region just upstream of the cl open reading frame and is oriented in the direction of cl. Because the promoter is present on a multicopy plasmid, it is not possible to make a direct calculation of promoter strength; however, the values observed are about five-fold lower than the levels produced by a derivative of pCB192 that contains the plac promoter from pUC19 (34). Because sequences on both sides of the BamHI site located upstream of cl are required for promoter activity (Table 2), we suggest that the promoter spans this site. Less than 10 bps downstream of this BamHI site is a heptanucleotide sequence (TATAATG) that is identical to the -10 consensus sequence for RNA polymerase (35). If this sequence does indeed correspond to the -10 region of the promoter, the -35 region would be predicted to lie on the other side of the BamHI site in a region that overlaps a known cI repressor binding site (2-5). Analysis of this region does not reveal any sequences with significant similarity to the -35 consensus sequence. The best fit is the sequence TCTATT (Figure 3), which matches only two positions of the -35 consensus (TTGACA). The lack of a strong -35 region is often observed with genes that require an activator. Although a pentanucleotide sequence corresponding to the conserved portion of the CRP protein consensus binding site (36) 7678 Nucleic Acids Research is located just upstream of the predicted -35 region (at position 91; Figure 3), a role for CRP-mediated activation in cl expression has not previously been described. The orientation of the promoter and its cl-repressible character raise the possibility that cl expression is autoregulatory. If this is so, one potential activator would be the cl repressor itself. Expression cannot be absolutely dependent on cl-mediated activation, however, because the cloned promoter exhibits significant activity in the absence of the cl gene (Table 2). Under the conditions reported here, the presence of the cl gene results in a decrease rather than an increase in lacZ expression; however, these observations do not rule out a potential activator role for the cl protein, since the ratios of repressor and operator provided by the multicopy plasmids may not be optimal for activation. Physiologically, the role of additional repressor binding sites in regulating cl expression also cannot be discounted. Three potential operator sites have been identified several hundred bps upstream of the cI open reading frame (2-5); one or more of these could be involved (possibly through a DNA looping mechanism; 37) in the activation or repression of cl expression during phage growth. A cl-repressible promoter oriented in the direction of cl was previously reported (38) to be located entirely within PlBamHI-9, a fragment located upstream of cl which is bracketed by the BamHI site within pBCB2. 13. Because sequences on both sides of this BamHI site are required for the activity of the promoter in pBCB2.13, we suggest that the previously identified promoter is distinct from the one reported here. The promoter from BamHI-9 could correspond to a consensus promoter sequence that is situated about 500 bps upstream of cl and overlaps a cl repressor binding site (2). If so, cl expression is likely to be controlled by more than one promoter. Located between this promoter sequence and the promoter encoded on pBCB2. 13 is an open reading frame whose product (termed coi, or c-one inactivator) has been implicated in the establishment of lytic growth (1, 39; B.R. Baumstark, unpublished results). It has been suggested (2) that the decision to enter lytic or lysogenic growth is influenced by the level of transcription initiated from the distal promoter (which would transcribe coi prior to the transcription of cl) relative to that of the promoter located immediately upstream of the cl gene (which would transcribe only ci). A 32-nucleotide hyphenated inverted repeat sequence is located just upstream of the cl open reading frame (positions 146-188; Figure 3). It is not currently known whether this sequence has any regulatory effect on cl expression. Conceivably, the sequence could serve as a recognition site for an as-yet-unidentified regulatory protein. Alternatively, it may affect the secondary structure of the messenger RNA. A transcript extending from a promoter located upstream of the putative coi open reading frame would be capable of forming a stable stem-loop structure containing 16 bps with a single bp mismatch (AG = -33.6 Kcal) of this inverted repeat sequence. Such a structure could potentially serve as a recognition site for a regulatory factor or, alternatively, could mask such a site. On the other hand, transcription originating from the promoter spanning the BamHI site just upstream of cl would start at a site within the inverted repeat sequence, forming a comparatively less stable stem-loop structure of about 8 bps. The role of the inverted repeat region in the regulation of cl expression is currently under investigation. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Heinz Schuster for his review of the manuscript.

2562362|t|Host immunity in the protective response to vaccination with heat-killed Burkholderia mallei
2562362|a|Abstract Background We performed initial cell, cytokine and complement depletion studies to investigate the possible role of these effectors in response to vaccination with heat-killed Burkholderia mallei in a susceptible BALB/c mouse model of infection. Results While protection with heat-killed bacilli did not result in sterilizing immunity, limited protection was afforded against an otherwise lethal infection and provided insight into potential host protective mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that mice depleted of either B cells, TNF-a or IFN-g exhibited decreased survival rates, indicating a role for these effectors in obtaining partial protection from a lethal challenge by the intraperitoneal route. Additionally, complement depletion had no effect on immunoglobulin production when compared to non-complement depleted controls infected intranasally. Conclusion The data provide a basis for future studies of protection via vaccination using either subunit or whole-organism vaccine preparations from lethal infection in the experimental BALB/c mouse model. The results of this study demonstrate participation of B220+ cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-g and TNF-a in protection following HK vaccination. Background Burkholderia mallei, the etiologic agent of glanders, is a gram-negative, capsulated, non-motile, facultative intracelluar bacterium. Most known members of the Burkholderiaceae are resident in the soil; however, B. mallei is thought to be an obligate mammalian pathogen. Horses are highly susceptible to infection and considered the natural reservoir for infection, although mules and donkeys are also susceptible [1]. Clinically, glanders in solipeds can present as either a chronic (horses) or acute (mules and donkeys) form. Naturally acquired human infection with B. mallei, although not seen in the United States since 1945, has occurred rarely and sporadically among laboratory workers and those in direct contact with infected animals [2]. However, glanders is endemic among domestic animals in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. The course of infection is dependent on the route of exposure. Direct contact with the skin can lead to a systemic infection. Inhalation of aerosol or dust containing B. mallei can lead to septicemic, pulmonary, or chronic infections of the muscle, liver and spleen. The disease has a 95% case fatality rate for untreated septicemic infections and a 50% case fatality rate in antibiotic-treated individuals [3]. There is no human or animal vaccine available for glanders, and development of a partial or fully protective adaptive host response to the organism has not been well-defined. Previous studies with B. mallei and the host response have shown that a mixed immune response consisting of both Th1 and Th2-associated cytokines with a predominant IgG1 subclass does not correlate with protection [4]. Additional studies with passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies specific for B. mallei have correlated with early protection from infection [5]. Recent studies have also shown the Th1 cytokine IL-12 to mediate partial protection to non-viable B. mallei-vaccinated mice [6]. Thus, full correlates of protection mediated by the adaptive immune system against B. mallei remain to be fully elucidated. In this series of studies, we sought to address the impact of depletion of the major effector lymphoid cell populations (B220+ B cells, CD4+ or CD8+ T cells) and key pro-inflammatory/Type 1 cytokines (IFN-g or TNF-a) on survival in BALB/c mice vaccinated with heat killed (HK) bacilli followed by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) challenge with live organism. In addition, studies investigating the effect of complement on opsonization of organism and antibody production were assessed. Heat killed bacteria were used as a model of vaccination to allow evaluation of B. mallei specific immune responses. The results of this study demonstrate participation of B220+ cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-g and TNF-a in protection following HK vaccination. Results Heat-killed B. mallei vaccination mediates partial protection from lethal challenge To begin to address this issue in an animal model of acute infection, we established that immunologically naive BALB/c mice challenged i.p. with 2 x 107 CFU resulted in death by day 4-6, while i.p. immunization with 1 x 105 heat killed (HK) bacteria provided partial protection against a subsequent challenge. Two independent experiments resulted in similar findings of 40% survival for HK-vaccinated mice with a mean survival time (MST) of 8 days versus 4 days in naive mice (Fig. 1). The administration of vaccines for B. mallei during an outbreak would mandate relatively rapid onset of protection for human or veterinary use. Based on non-routine use and vaccine implementation in the course of an outbreak, a 14 day window was chosen for assessment of protection. Our results indicate that HK vaccination can afford partial protection to an otherwise lethal challenge of B. mallei by the i.p. route. Effects of cell depletion on HK-vaccinated survival To dissect the cellular basis for protection mediated by HK vaccination, 13 days after immunization with HK bacteria (day -1), and at day of challenge, mice were dosed with antibodies to deplete CD4+, CD8+ or B220+ cells. Antibody depletion of CD4+, CD8+, or B220+ cells in these mice was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis with depletion efficiencies for CD4, CD8, and B220 populations at 99.7%, 96%, and 95%, respectively, relative to mice treated with isotype control monoclonal antibodies (data not shown). Our results demonstrated decreased survival rates in B220 (p = 0.3418), CD4+ (p = 0.5417) and CD8+ (p = 0.4684) antibody depleted mice, compared to isotype control antibody, a finding that indicated a possible role for vaccine induced antibody production. When challenged with 2 x 107 CFU/mouse by the i.p. route, loss of T cells resulted in reduced survival (50%) relative to the non-specific isotype control (Fig. 2). In contrast to the loss of T cells, depletion of B220+ cells resulted in 100% mortality relative to the non-specific isotype control (Fig. 2). To further evaluate the necessity of these effector cells in providing protection following HK vaccination, relatively resistant C57BL/6 mice, deficient in mature B-cells (uMT), CD4 T-cells (CD4-/-) or CD8 T-cells (CD8-/-) were subjected to an identical HK vaccination and challenge regimen. Mature, B-cell-deficient mice demonstrated a 50% decreased survival (p = 0.0888) compared to the wild-type mice with an MST of 35.5 days (Fig. 3). CD4-/- and CD8-/- mice exhibited a 60% (p = 0.1343) and 0% reduced survival, respectively (Fig. 3). Effects of cytokine depletion on HK vaccination Similar studies were performed to determine the role of IFN-g or TNF-a in acute infection in BALB/c mice immunized with HK bacteria. Six hours before challenge, mice were dosed with antibodies that neutralize IFN-g or TNF-a. Individual depletion of either TNF-a (p = 0.0145) or IFN-g (p = 0.0446) resulted in 100% mortality with an MST of 3 and 2 days, respectively, compared to the HK-vaccinated isotype control mice (Fig. 4). In contrast, 40% of HK-vaccinated, isotype control mice survived to at least 12 days post-challenge (Fig 4). To further evaluate the host TNF-a response during an established B. mallei chronic infection, we infected 12 BALB/c mice by the i.p. route with 1 x 106 CFU B. mallei. One animal was terminally ill on day 37 post-infection. On day 42 post-infection, the remaining 11 mice were dosed with either anti-TNF-a (n = 6), or control mAb (AFRC Mac 49) (n = 5). No further deaths were observed in the control mAb-treated mice. Rapid mortality was observed in the anti-TNF-a-treated group, with all mice dying within 7 days of treatment (p = 0.0023) relative to the isotype-treated controls (Fig. 5). J774A.1 uptake of serum treated B. mallei Complement mediated uptake assays were performed to evaluate opsonization. Results indicated enhanced bacterial uptake in J774A.1 phagocytes inoculated with serum treated B. mallei (p = .0082), compared to B. mallei alone, while heat-inactivated serum produced uptake percentages similar to those prior to serum addition (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results imply an active role for complement components in the uptake of organism by macrophages. Immunoglobulin production in HK vaccinated BALB/c mice We further characterized the ability of HK vaccination to induce a predominant IgG isotype by determining IgG2a/IgG1 ratios in i.p. and i.n. vaccinated BALB/c mice. Pre (day 14 post vaccination) and post (day 2 post infection) exposure serum samples were obtained and evaluated for IgG isotype concentrations (Table 1). No appreciable differences in IgG pre-exposure levels were seen when comparing i.n. to i.p. vaccination. In addition, cobra venom factor-treated animals showed no significant differences to non-cobra venom factor-treated animals in IgG pre-exposure (challenge) levels. Conversely, isotype switching in the cobra venom factor treated animals was enhanced in post-exposure serum IgG2a (Table 1). Discussion Recent studies have shown a key role in protection from lethal challenge for IFN-g in non-vaccinated mice from either NK and/or NKT cells following experimental exposure to B. mallei and B. pseudomallei [7,8]. A similar protective role in the innate response to infection has been demonstrated for TNF-a in B. pseudomallei infection [8]. The studies presented here are consistent with the essential role of these factors in the relative levels of protection conferred by vaccination with heat-killed B. pseudomallei and would appear to be viable early markers for protection from lethal acute infection [9]. Currently, there are no fully protective vaccines against B. mallei or B. pseudomallei in a murine model, particularly for the sensitive BALB/c versus C57BL6 models. Previous studies have also demonstrated that both the humoral and cell-mediated arms are essential for protection from B. pseudomallei infection [10]. Thus, loss or reduction of TNF-a and IFN-g levels result in significantly reduced survival rates, substantiating previous reports of the role of these factors in protection against B. mallei [7]. Moreover, we demonstrate a role for sustained TNF-a production in the maintenance of host survival throughout the course of B. mallei infection. Mice with an established B. mallei chronic infection rapidly lost the ability to control the growth of the bacillus upon neutralization of TNF-a. This would suggest a potential role for TNF-a in the maintenance of productive granulomas which may limit the spread of bacteria in chronically infected hosts, or, alternatively, in direct or indirect microbicidal or bacteriostatic activities at the sites of infection. Additional studies are underway to determine more precisely the role of TNF-a in host protection to B. mallei. Multiple innate and adaptive cell types may contribute to the production of IFN-g in response to infection with B. mallei following vaccination. Our results with individual depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells suggests that both cell types may compensate for the functional loss of the other effector cell type in the production of this key cytokine. The effector role for IFN-g in mediating protection against B. mallei may include both immunoregulatory and non-regulatory functions. Regardless, the requirement of IFN-g, as demonstrated by administration of neutralizing antibody prior to infection, indicates that stimulation of IFN-g response is a desirable goal for a B. mallei vaccine. Similarly, B220-positive cells appear to play a role in protection following vaccination with heat-killed B. mallei. Interestingly, this protective immunity, occurring in other intracellular pathogens, is not exclusively dependent on B cells [11]. Passive protection has been demonstrated against acute Burkholderia infection by monoclonal antibodies [5,12]. Protection against B. pseudomallei infection by anti-LPS, capsular polysaccharide and proteins has been short-lived, suggesting that antibody production offers limited protection in the initial stages of infection by an as-yet-undefined mechanism [12]. We have shown that following depletion of B220+ cells, survival rates decreased as much as 100% relative to non-depleted controls and individual CD4/CD8-depleted mice via the intraperitoneal route. Results from C57BL/6 mice deficient in mature B-cells (uMT), CD4 T-cells (CD4-/-) or CD8 T-cells (CD8-/-) substantiate the requirement for B-cell involvement by evidence of uMT and CD4-/- decreased survival. The lack of an effective CTL response to vaccination did not appear to alter survival in what would appear to be a CD4/B-cell (humoral)-driven response. In CD4-deficient mice, we have the additional potential variable that a CD4-dependent antibody response might also be inhibited during the vaccination phase relative to mice treated with antibody immediately prior to and during the early phases of infection. Although not statistically significant, we did observe a decrease in survival in uMT (mature B cell) deficient mice as early as day 9 post challenge, whereas CD4-deficient mice produced similar results at day 32 post challenge, indicating a role for B cells independent of CD4 T cell help, perhaps through a T-independent mechanism of antibody production. Although CD8-/- C57BL/6 demonstrated no decreased survival in our HK-vaccinated model, a lack of potential endogenous protein production by HK B. mallei may have contributed to limited MHC-I presentation. Complement associated studies revealed increased J774A.1 uptake of serum-treated B. mallei. Complement-mediated uptake studies of B. pseudomallei by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) suggest that capsule production contributes to resistance of phagocytosis by reducing C3b bacterial deposition [13]. Previous studies have demonstrated that a polysaccharide capsule is present in B. mallei, [14,15] although in the present study enhanced uptake with serum-treated B. mallei was observed. Intracellular survival assays of complement mediated uptake of organisms were not performed in the present study, thus, the role of complement opsonization on intracellular survival is not fully resolved. Previous reports have demonstrated the ability of B. mallei to survive within macrophage without the aid of serum coating organisms [16]. Conversely, the idea of antibody mediated opsonization to facilitate macrophage activation and clearance of intracellular organisms may offer support to the role of B cells in an effective immune response. A possible protective mechanism may include HK vaccination induced production of opsonizing antibodies which may aid in complement mediated uptake, thereby limiting the initial bacterial threshold below a lethal level. Immunoglobulin responses to HK vaccination resulted in modest levels of IgG1 following 2 weeks post vaccination, while post-exposure levels were indicative of efficient class switching to a favorable IgG2a isotype. Importantly, cobra venom factor treatment of animals at time of vaccination did not alter their ability to produce immunoglobulin. In fact, cobra venom factor treated animals resulted in higher IgG2a levels when compared to non-treated. Complement activation can modulate both the primary and secondary immune responses and has been shown to enhance secondary immune responses to vaccination [17]. The current results suggest that cobra venom factor treatment may affect the modulation of the immune response to B. mallei infection through B cell activation and/or memory B cell generation. Conclusion In summary, our results provide a basis for future studies of protection via vaccination using either subunit or whole-organism vaccine preparations from lethal infection in the experimental BALB/c mouse model. Understanding and defining the role of B cells in adaptive B. mallei immunity will likely be fundamental to the design of an efficacious vaccine and important goals of future research. Methods Bacterial strain and mice B. mallei strain ATCC 23344 (China 7) was cultured on Luria-Bertani agar supplemented with 4% glycerol (LB+4%G) agar plates for 48 h at 37oC. Isolated colonies were sub-cultured to LB+4%G broth, and cultures were incubated at 37oC until optical density readings at 600 nm (OD600) reached an exponential phase of growth. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, washed and re-suspended in sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to obtain the desired CFU/ml. To obtain HK inoculums, bacterial suspensions were incubated at 85oC for 3 h and stored at 4oC until use. The absence of live B. mallei organisms in the HK preparations was confirmed after plating 10% of the total inoculums (v/v) and incubating these at 37oC for 48 h. All procedures were performed under a class II biosafety cabinet in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Female, 6- to 8-week-old, BALB/c mice (n = 5-7) were obtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, Indiana). Female, 6- to 8-week-old, C57BL/6 mice deficient in mature B-cells (uMT), CD4 T-cells (CD4-/-) and CD8 T-cells (CD8-/-) and wild-type mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). Vaccination and challenge BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were grouped and vaccinated with 0.5 ug of HK B. mallei (without adjuvant) by i.p. injection using a 25-gauge syringe. Two weeks post HK vaccination mice were injected i.p. with 2 x 107 CFU/100 ul of live B. mallei (~20 LD50) [18]. Complement depleted animals were challenged with 2.5 x 104 CFU/50 ul (~0.25 LD50) by intranasal (i.n.) route. Aliquots from the inoculums were plated to confirm the infecting dose. All procedures and animal protocols used in this study were approved by the Biosafety and IACUC committees at UTMB and conducted in either BSL-3 or ABSL-3 laboratories. Cell and cytokine depletions Acute in vivo cell/cytokine depletion was performed with monoclonal rat anti-mouse CD4 (GK1.5), CD8a (53-6.7) or B220 (RA3-6B2) obtained from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) by methods similar to those we have previously described [19]. Functional grade purified rat anti-mouse interferon-gamma (IFN-g, AN-18) was obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA) and purified anti-mouse tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a, MP6-XT3) from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). IFN-g and TNF-a antibodies were injected i.p. 6 h prior to challenge, 200 ug per mouse in 200 ul PBS or at later time points as indicated. Rat IgG isotype control was obtained from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL) and administered i.p. on day of challenge, 200 ug/mouse. Rat anti-mouse CD4, CD8a and B220 were injected i.p. twice, 1 day prior to challenge and on day of challenge, with an equivalent dosage sufficient to deplete T or B cells from 6 x 108 bone marrow cells per injection. The efficiency of depletion at time of infection for CD4+, CD8+, and B220+ cells was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis immediately prior to infection. Complement depletion with cobra venom factor Mice, six to seven per group, were vaccinated i.p. with 1 x 105 CFU of nonviable B. mallei cell preparation in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Two weeks later, 24 h and 1 h before challenge, complement depleted mice were treated i.p. with 12.5 units total cobra venom factor (Quidel Corporation Speciality Products, San Diego, CA) in 0.1 ml of PBS. Complement depletion was confirmed prior to challenge by micro-titer hemolytic complement activity (CH50) assay as previously described [20]. B. mallei J774A.1 uptake assays J774A.1 cells were seeded (5 x 105) onto Corning costar 24 well plates (Corning, NY) with DMEM and incubated overnight at 37oC with 5% CO2. Bacterial suspensions were incubated at 37oC for 45 minutes supplemented with 2% mouse serum from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO.), heat inactivated mouse serum (56oC 30 minutes), or bacteria alone and then added at an MOI of 10:1 to J774A.1 cells in triplicate. Inoculated wells were centrifuged at 800 g for 2 minutes and incubated for 2 hours at 37oC with 5% CO2 followed by a PBS wash (x2) and 2 hour incubation with 250 ug/ml kanamycin. Wells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by serial 10-fold dilutions plated on LBG plates and incubated at 37oC for 2 days. Colony forming units were enumerated and uptake expressed as a percentage of initial inoculating dose + SEM. Antibodies and flow cytometry Flow cytometric analysis was performed on 0.1-ml blood samples transferred to micro centrifuge tubes containing 90 ul of acid citrate dextrose (ACD) solution. Red blood cells were lysed using ACK-lysing buffer (Biosource International, Inc., Camarillo, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Antibodies used for analysis of surface markers included: FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45R/B220 (RA3-6B2, BD Pharmingen San Diego, CA) for B cells; FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD8a (53-6.7) and CD4 (GK1.5, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for CD8+ or CD4+ cells, respectively. Samples evaluated for CD4+ and CD8a+ cells were also incubated with biotin-conjugated hamster anti-mouse CD3e (145-2C11) monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and subsequently with streptavidin APC Cy7. Isotype-matched, non-specific controls were assayed in parallel (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Surface staining was performed according to previously published protocols [21]. Following cell staining, the samples were fixed with 2% buffered paraformaldehyde overnight prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with BD CellQuest Pro software. Antibody assays Immunoglobulin subclass IgG1 and IgG2a titers in mice were determined by a whole bacterial cell ELISA performed in 96-well, Immulon 2 HB, round-bottom plates (Dynex Technologies). B. mallei antigen was diluted in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) and 50 ul of diluted cells placed into wells. Plates were stored overnight at 4oC. The plates were washed with washing solution (1x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated with 100 ul of blocking solution (1x PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at 37oC. Dilutions of mouse sera were made with blocking solution in duplicate and plates were incubated for 1 h at 37oC. Following incubation, plates were washed and 50 ul of anti-Ig-horseradish peroxidase subclass conjugate, diluted accordingly to manufacturer's instructions (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. Birmingham, Ala.), was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37oC. After washing, 50 ul of 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthizoline)-6-sulfonate (ABTS) peroxidase substrate (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland) was added to each well and plates incubated for 25 min at room temperature. The amount of bound antibody was determined colorimetrically by absorbance at 405 nm. Statistical analysis Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan Meier survival analysis with log-rank tests between groups using GraphPad Prism (V.4.03 for windows). Statistical analysis was generally performed with the paired Student's t-test. P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Abbreviations HK: Heat-killed; i.p.: intraperitoneal; i.n.: intranasal.

1913570|t|Elevated Blood Lead Levels of Children in Guiyu, an Electronic Waste Recycling Town in China
1913570|a|Abstract Background Electronic waste (e-waste) recycling has remained primitive in Guiyu, China, and thus may contribute to the elevation of blood lead levels (BLLs) in children living in the local environment. Objectives We compared the BLLs in children living in the e-waste recycling town of Guiyu with those living in the neighboring town of Chendian. Methods We observed the processing of e-waste recycling in Guiyu and studied BLLs in a cluster sample of 226 children < 6 years of age who lived in Guiyu and Chendian. BLLs were determined with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Hemoglobin (Hgb) and physical indexes (height and weight, head and chest circumferences) were also measured. Results BLLs in 165 children of Guiyu ranged from 4.40 to 32.67 ug/dL with a mean of 15.3 ug/dL, whereas BLLs in 61 children of Chendian were from 4.09 to 23.10 ug/dL with a mean of 9.94 ug/dL. Statistical analyses showed that children living in Guiyu had significantly higher BLLs compared with those living in Chendian (p < 0.01). Of children in Guiyu, 81.8% (135 of 165) had BLLs > 10 ug/dL, compared with 37.7% of children (23 of 61) in Chendian (p < 0.01). In addition, we observed a significant increasing trend in BLLs with increasing age in Guiyu (p < 0.01). It appeared that there was correlation between the BLLs in children and numbers of e-waste workshops. However, no significant difference in Hgb level or physical indexes was found between the two towns. Conclusions The primitive e-waste recycling activities may contribute to the elevated BLLs in children living in Guiyu. Disposal of electronic waste, or e-waste, is an emerging global environmental issue, as these wastes have become the most rapidly growing segment of the municipal waste stream in the world [Dahl 2002; Halluite et al. 2005; Jang and Townsend 2003; Schmidt 2002; Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) 2001]. It is reported that approximately 500 million computers became obsolete between 1997 and 2007 in the United States (National Safety Council 1999). Up to 80% of e-waste from the United States has seeped into Asia and Africa (Johnson 2006; Puckett et al. 2002; Schmidt 2002, 2006; SVTC 2001). It is noteworthy that the United States is the only developed country today that has not ratified the United Nations Basel Convention, which bans the export of hazardous wastes to developing countries (United Nations Environment Programme 1992, 2006; USA Today 2002). Together with New Delhi in India, Guiyu in Shantou, Guangdong Province, China (Figure 1), is one of the popular destinations of e-waste (Brigden et al. 2005; Puckett et al. 2002). Within a total area of 52 km2 and local population of 132,000 (in 2003), Guiyu has accommodated millions of tons of e-waste from overseas and domestic a year. Nearly 60-80% of families in the town have engaged in e-waste recycling operations conducted by small scale family-run workshops, with approximately 100,000 migrant workers employed in processing e-waste. Because the implementation of a clean and safe high-tech recovery process was very expensive (Allsopp et al. 2006), the processes and techniques used during the recycling activities in Guiyu were very primitive. The result was that many tons of e-waste material and process residues were dumped in workshops, yards, roadsides, open fields, irrigation canals, riverbanks, ponds, and rivers. Hazardous chemicals can be released from e-wastes through disposal or recycling processes, threatening the health of local residents. Several studies have reported the soaring levels of toxic heavy metals and organic contaminants in samples of dust, soil, river sediment, surface water, and groundwater of Guiyu (Brigden et al. 2005; Puckett et al. 2002; Wang and Guo 2006; Wang et al. 2005; Wong et al. 2006; Yu et al. 2006). Previously, we have shown that the residents in Guiyu had high incidence of skin damage, headaches, vertigo, nausea, chronic gastritis, and gastric and duodenal ulcers, all of which may be caused by the primitive recycling processing of e-waste (Qiu et al. 2004). Of many toxic heavy metals, lead is the most widely used in electronic devices for various purposes, resulting in a variety of health hazards due to environmental contamination (Jang and Townsend 2003; Musson et al. 2006; Vann et al. 2006). Lead enters biological systems via food, water, air, and soil. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning   more so than adults because they absorb more lead from their environments (Baghurst et al. 1992; Grigg 2004; Guilarte et al. 2003; Jain and Hu 2006; Needleman 2004; Safi et al. 2006; Wasserman et al. 1998). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) as those > 10 ug/dL in children < 6 years of age (CDC 1991). Nevertheless, studies have increasingly shown that low blood lead concentrations, even < 10 ug/dL, were inversely associated with children   s IQ scores and academic skills (Canfield et al. 2003; Lanphear et al. 2000, 2005; Nevin 2000; Schnaas et al. 2006). Therefore, no safety margin at existing exposures has been identified (Chiodo et al. 2004; Koller et al. 2004). Considering the potential heavy metal contamination in the local living environment of Guiyu, we hypothesized that children living in Guiyu may have elevated BLLs and thus their physical and mental development may have been affected. In this study, we evaluated the mean BLLs in children 1-6 years of age living in Guiyu and compared them with those living in the neighboring town of Chendian, where no e-waste processing was taken. Materials and Methods Geographic location and site description There are 28 villages with a total area of 52 km2 and a resident population of 132,000 and around 100,000 migrant workers in Guiyu (Figure 1). We chose four villages for their differences in the scale and type of e-waste processing. Beilin village has dense e-waste workshops mainly involved in equipment dismantling, circuit board baking, and acid baths; Dutou village specializes in plastics sorting, including manually stripping plastic materials from electronic products and then crudely classifying them; Huamei village had workshops similar to those of Beilin, but they are fewer and scattered; and Longgang village was involved in plastic reprocessing in which plastics collected from Dutou and other villages were washed and smashed into tiny pieces of recycled plastic. We used the neighboring town of Chendian as a control because the local residents work mainly in the textiles industry, not in e-waste processing. The population, traffic density, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status were very similar to those of Guiyu. Study population The study population was composed of children < 6 years of age. No children involved in the study had any occupational exposure to e-waste. A cluster sample of 165 children with a median age of 5.0 years lived in the four villages of Guiyu (Figure 1). Sixty-one children with a median age of 4.0 years resided in Chendian were included in the study for comparison. After written informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians, blood samples were collected from the children at village kindergartens. To facilitate the counseling process, advice on dietary and eating habits to minimize lead exposure were provided to the local residents. All children found to have high BLLs were advised to get further hospital treatment. The study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Shantou University Medical College. Measurement of BLLs and hemoglobin Venipuncture blood samples were obtained from each volunteer at the kindergarten, and collected in lead-free tubes by trained nurses. Lead in total blood was analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS), which consisted of a Shimadzu AA-660 AAS and GFA-4B graphite furnace atomizer and an ACS-60G autosampler (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The main parameters used for the determination were a wavelength of 283.3 nm, current of 8 mA, a slit width of 1.00 nm, drying at 150oC, ashing at 325oC, and atomization at 1,400oC. The accuracy of the method was controlled by recoveries between 95% and 107% from the spiked blood samples. Repeated analyses of standard solutions confirmed the method   s precision. The BLLs were expressed in micrograms per deciliter (1 ug/dL = 0.0484 umol/L). Meanwhile, we assessed hemoglobin (Hgb) levels by hemoglobin cyanide method with hemoglobinometer (XK-2, JiangSu, China). Evaluation of physical developmental indexes Children   s physical growth and development, such as body height, weight, and head and chest circumferences were measured when blood samples were collected. Weight and height were measured using a weighing and height scale (TZ120; Yuyao Balance Instrument Factory, Yuyao, China) with maximum weight of 120 kg (minimum scale, 50 g) and minimum height of 70 cm (minimum scale, 0.5 cm). Head and chest circumferences were measured using graduated anthropometric tapes. Statistical analyses We performed statistical analyses using SPSS version 10.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). We used independent sample t-tests or covariance analyses for comparisons of mean, chi-square analyses for test of frequency data, and linear regression analysis for the association between BLLs and age. Differences were considered significant with a p-value < 0.05. Results Observation of e-waste processing The primitive e-waste recycling procedures in Guiyu were mainly as follows: a) Old electronic equipment was dismantled (Figure 2) with electric drill, cutter, hammer, and screwdriver into component parts such as monitor, hard drive, CD driver, wires, cables, circuit boards, transformer, charger, battery, and plastic or metal frame that are sold for reuse or to other workshops for further recycling. b) Circuit boards (Figure 3) of computers and other large appliances were heated over coal fires to melt the solder to release valuable electronic components, such as diodes, resistors, and microchips. c) Circuit boards of cell phones and other hand-held devices were taken apart by a electrothermal machine (Figure 4), which was a particular environmental and human health concern in the processing of e-waste in Guiyu. d) In acid baths (Figure 5), some microchips and computer parts were soaked to extract precious gold and palladium, from which the waste acids were discharged into nearby fields and streams. e) Wires and cables were stripped or simply burnt in open air to recover metals. f) Printer cartridges were ripped apart for their toner and recyclable aluminum, steel, and plastic parts. g) Plastic [e.g., polyvinyl chloride (PVC), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer (ABS), high-density polyethylene (HDPE)] was sorted by workers according to rigidity, color, and luster. Plastic scraps that cannot be sorted visually must be burned and classified by burning odor. Another way to sort different plastics was gravitational separation into ceramic jugs with brine (Figure 6), after which the pieces were spread on the sidewalk to dry; h) For reprocessing, after sorting plastic scraps were fed into grinders that spit out tiny pieces of plastic. i) For metals sorting and reprocessing, transformers, chargers, batteries, and cathode-ray tubes were separated and hammered open for recycling metals such as copper, steel, silver, aluminum, which were then reprocessed to raw material. Although the methods for processing e-waste were primitive, the coordination of e-waste recycling in Guiyu was very well organized into specific tasks. Workshops specializing in dismantled equipment would not conduct circuit board baking or plastics and metals reprocessing. The chain of recycling components from each type of e-waste was well established in the town. BLLs in children We collected blood from 165 children in Guiyu and 61 children in Chendian and measured the BLLs in these children. Table 1 shows that the BLLs corresponded to the children   s age, sex, and town of residence. As expected, BLLs among Guiyu children were much higher than those in the children of Chendian (p < 0.01). Among Guiyu children, 135 (81.8%) had BLLs > 10 ug/dL, whereas 23 (37.7%) in Chendian (p < 0.01) had high levels. Among 135 (81.8%) Guiyu children with elevated BLLs, 61.8% and 20% had BLLs > 10 ug/dL and 20 ug/dL respectively, but lead levels > 45 ug/dL were not found. And BLLs of Guiyu increased somewhat with age (p < 0.01); older children tended to have higher BLLs than younger ones. We found no evidence for the association in lead concentrations or prevalence of elevated BLLs differentiated by sex (both p > 0.05). Table 2 presents BLLs for 165 exposed children in the four villages. The findings showed that BLLs from different villages were in the following descending order: Beilin, 19.34 ug/dL > Dutou, 17.86 ug/dL > Huamei, 14.23 ug/dL > Longgang, 13.13 ug/dL (Table 2). Children living in Beilin, where the number of e-waste workshops specializing in equipment dismantling, circuit board baking, and acid baths, had the highest BLLs. Dutou, which had many workshops specializing in plastics sorting, including strip plastic materials from e-waste, had the second highest BLLs in children. Huamei had e-waste workshops similar to those of Beilin, but fewer and less centralized; the BLLs of Huamei children were much lower than those of Beilin and Dutou. Longgang, a village specializing in reprocessing plastics collected from other villages that had no workshops directly processing e-waste, had the lowest BLLs. There was a significant difference in BLLs among the children of the four villages (p < 0.01). In Beilin and Dutou, 88.8% and 100% children had elevated BLLs > 10 ug/dL, respectively. As far as physical indexes and Hgb levels were concerned, there was no significant difference between Guiyu and Chendian (p > 0.05, Table 3). Discussion In this study, we observed that the processing of e-waste in Guiyu was very primitive and the recycling industry depended mainly on manual processing methods. Despite the fact that the coordination of the e-waste recycling is well organized in family-based small business units, the manual processing methods and the deposition of the e-waste have contributed to the contamination by heavy metals in the living environment. Examination of the possible impact of the e-waste industry on the BLLs of children living in Guiyu revealed that Guiyu children had significantly higher BLLs than Chendian children. Of children tested in Guiyu, 81.8% had BLLs > 10 ug/dL, indicating a correlation between the BLLs in children and the numbers of e-waste workshops. We speculated that the elevated BLLs in Guiyu children may be directly caused by the contamination of the lead during e-waste recycling. However, further study should be conducted to determine the relationship between BLLs in Children and the actual lead contamination in the environment. Lead is considered one of the major heavy metal contaminants during the process of e-waste recycling. A cathode ray tube inside a television set or a computer monitor contains an average of 4-8 lb lead; monitor glass contains about 20% lead by weight; a typical battery weighs 36 lb and contains about 18 lb of lead. For decades, lead as a major component of solders has been used to attach electronic components to printed circuit boards. Lead compounds have also been used as stabilizers in some PVC cables and other products. Our study demonstrated in Guiyu a significant increasing trend in BLLs with increasing age; older children tended to have higher BLLs than younger ones. This might be the result of increasing exposure risk because older children might have more outdoor activities. In addition, it may also be attributed to the fact that the heaviest lead-contaminated zone in air after the burning of the e-waste was 75-100 cm above the ground (Wang and Zhang 2006), which was the height range for normal Chinese children 5-6 years of age. In China, the mean BLL of children was 9.29 ug/dL, and 33.8% of the subjects had BLLs > 10 ug/dL; boys    mean BLL was 9.64 ug/dL, significantly higher than the girls    mean BLL of 8.94 ug/dL (p < 0.001) (Wang and Zhang 2006). Generally in China, BLLs of children living in industrial and urban areas were significantly higher than those of children in suburbs and rural areas (Wang and Zhang 2006). In Guiyu, the BLLs of children were higher than the mean level in China, and there were no significant different between boys and girls. Although Guiyu is rural, the children   s BLLs were nearly double those of a nearby urban area, Shantou City (7.9 ug/dL; Luo et al. 2003). Compared with results from studies conducted in some other part of Guangdong province, such as Zhongshan City (7.45 ug/dL; Huang et al. 2003) and Shenzhen City (9.06 ug/dL; Wang et al. 2003), we observed higher BLLs not only in Guiyu children, but also in Chendian children (9.94 ug/dL). The lead contamination may have spread from Guiyu to nearby Chendian by dust, river, and air and contributed to the elevation of Chendian children   s BLLs. In conclusion, elevated BLLs in Guiyu children are common as a result of exposure to lead contamination caused by primitive e-waste recycling activities. Lead contamination from e-waste processing appears to have reached the level considered to be a serious threat to children   s health around the e-waste recycling area. Based on these threats, it is necessary to increase public awareness about the effects of exposure to lead from e-waste and arouse local governments    interest in public health and safety, so that an infrastructure for safe management of e-waste can be established. More important, responsible management strategies should be undertaken to minimize e-waste production and make e-waste components more easily recycled and reused. Correction In the Abstract and Discussion, the percentage of Guiyu children with BLLs > 10 ug/dL has been corrected from 88% in the original manuscript published online to 81.8%.
