10064899|t|A specific human lysophospholipase: cDNA cloning, tissue distribution and kinetic characterization.
10064899|a|Lysophospholipases are critical enzymes that act on biological membranes to regulate the multifunctional lysophospholipids; increased levels of lysophospholipids are associated with a host of diseases. Herein we report the cDNA cloning of a human brain 25 kDa lysophospholipid-specific lysophospholipase (hLysoPLA). The enzyme (at both mRNA and protein levels) is widely distributed in tissues, but with quite different abundances. The hLysoPLA hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine in both monomeric and micellar forms, and exhibits apparent cooperativity and surface dilution kinetics, but not interfacial activation. Detailed kinetic analysis indicates that the hLysoPLA binds first to the micellar surface and then to the substrate presented on the surface. The kinetic parameters associated with this surface dilution kinetic model are reported, and it is concluded that hLysoPLA has a single substrate binding site and a surface recognition site. The apparent cooperativity observed is likely due to the change of substrate presentation. In contrast to many non-specific lipolytic enzymes that exhibit lysophospholipase activity, hLysoPLA hydrolyzes only lysophospholipids and has no other significant enzymatic activity. Of special interest, hLysoPLA does not act on plasmenylcholine. Of the several inhibitors tested, only methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) potently and irreversibly inhibits the enzymatic activity. The inhibition by MAFP is consistent with the catalytic mechanism proposed for the enzyme - a serine hydrolase with a catalytic triad composed of Ser-119, Asp-174 and His-208.

10072425|t|Functional domains of the SYT and SYT-SSX synovial sarcoma translocation proteins and co-localization with the SNF protein BRM in the nucleus.
10072425|a|The t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) chromosomal translocation commonly found in synovial sarcomas fuses the SYT gene on chromosome 18 to either of two similar genes, SSX1 or SSX2, on the X chromosome. The SYT protein appears to act as a transcriptional co-activator and the SSX proteins as co-repressors. Here we have investigated the functional domains of the proteins. The SYT protein has a novel conserved 54 amino acid domain at the N-terminus of the protein (the SNH domain) which is found in proteins from a wide variety of species, and a C-terminal domain, rich in glutamine, proline, glycine and tyrosine (the QPGY domain), which contains the transcriptional activator sequences. Deletion of the SNH domain results in a more active transcriptional activator, suggesting that this domain acts as an inhibitor of the activation domain. The C-terminal SSX domain present in SYT-SSX translocation protein contributes a transcriptional repressor domain to the protein. Thus, the fusion protein has transcriptional activating and repressing domains. We demonstrate that the human homologue of the SNF2/Brahama protein BRM co-localizes with SYT and SYT-SSX in nuclear speckles, and also interacts with SYT and SYT-SSX proteins in vitro. This interaction may provide an explanation of how the SYT protein activates gene transcription.

10189359|t|Identification and expression of delta-isoforms of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in failing and nonfailing human myocardium.
10189359|a|Despite its importance for the regulation of heart function, little is known about the isoform expression of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) in human myocardium. In this study, we investigated the spectrum of CaMKII isoforms delta2, delta3, delta4, delta8, and delta9 in human striated muscle tissue. Isoform delta3 is characteristically expressed in cardiac muscle. In skeletal muscle, specific expression of a new isoform termed delta11 is demonstrated. Complete sequencing of human delta2 cDNA, representing all common features of the investigated CaMKII subclass, revealed its high homology to the corresponding rat cDNA. Comparative semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses from left ventricular tissues of normal hearts and from patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy showed a significant increase in transcript levels of isoform delta3 relative to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in diseased hearts (101. 6+/-11.0% versus 64.9+/-9.9% in the nonfailing group; P < 0.05, n=6). Transcript levels of the other investigated cardiac CaMKII isoforms remained unchanged. At the protein level, by using a subclass-specific antibody, we observed a similar increase of a delta-CaMKII-specific signal (7.2+/-1.0 versus 3.8+/-0.7 optical density units in the nonfailing group; P < 0.05, n=4 through 6). The diseased state of the failing hearts was confirmed by a significant increase in transcript levels for atrial natriuretic peptide (292. 9+/-76.4% versus 40.1+/-3.2% in the nonfailing group; P < 0.05, n=3 through 6). Our data characterize for the first time the delta-CaMKII isoform expression pattern in human hearts and demonstrate changes in this expression pattern in heart failure.

10226785|t|Cloning and sequencing of the complete cDNA encoding the human insulin receptor related receptor.
10226785|a|The insulin receptor related receptor (IRR) is a heterotetrameric transmembrane receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The IRR shares large homology with the insulin and the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) receptor with regard to amino acid sequence and protein structure. So far, only a partial human sequence containing the complete 3' end has been reported, although the full-length human IRR cDNA had been used for transfection studies and functional analysis of the receptor. We have isolated a full-length human IRR cDNA and report on the 5' translated and untranslated region of the human IRR gene. The full length IRR sequence contains 4150 bases and shares a high degree of homology with the guinea pig IRR cDNA sequence and rat IRR sequences that had been reported earlier on by others. Sequencing of the IRR cDNA revealed that the human IRR cDNA contains 341 bases corresponding to the IRR 5' end in addition to the bases that had been reported on before. Also, this sequence contains the start codon of translation. The full length cDNA for the human IRR can now be used for functional expression studies and to elucidate the nature of the ligand for this receptor type.

10319585|a|We isolated a cDNA clone which shows a significant similarity with the renal Na+/phosphate cotransporter (NPT) from a human intestine mucosa cDNA library. The cDNA is 2626 bases long, with one open reading frame encoding a protein of 497 amino acids. The deduced amino acids sequence shows an overall homology of 48% with the human renal NPT1 protein. This gene is expressed in intestine, colon, liver, and pancreas. Thus, this gene may code for intestinal type NPT or closely related proteins. The chromosomal location of the gene was determined on the chromosome 6p21.3-p22 region by polymerase chain reaction-based analysis with both a human/rodent mono-chromosomal hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid mapping panel.

10438902|t|Cutting edge: immature dendritic cells generated from monocytes in the presence of TGF-beta 1 express functional C-C chemokine receptor 6.
10438902|a|Although CD34+ progenitor-derived immature dendritic cells (DCs) express CCR6, several recent studies reported that monocyte-derived immature DCs do not do so. We observed that DCs generated from monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4, and TGF-beta 1 consistently responded to liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha). These immature DCs expressed one class of high-affinity binding sites for LARC, and expressed both CCR6 mRNA and protein. Therefore, LARC-CCR6 interaction presumably also contributes to the regulation of trafficking of monocyte-derived DCs, and utilization of TGF-beta can potentially provide a ready source of CCR6+ monocyte-derived DCs for therapeutic purposes.

10441506|t|Identification and characterization of PKNbeta, a novel isoform of protein kinase PKN: expression and arachidonic acid dependency are different from those of PKNalpha.
10441506|a|The cDNA clone encoding a novel isoform of protein kinase PKN, termed PKNbeta, was isolated from a HeLa cDNA library. PKNbeta had high sequence homology with PKNalpha, originally isolated PKN, especially in the repeats of charged amino acid-rich region with leucine-zipper like sequences (CZ region/HR1), in the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain, and in approximately 130 amino acid stretch (D region/HR2), located between CZ region/HR1 and the catalytic domain. However, the amino acid sequence of PKNbeta differed from that of PKNalpha in the region immediately amino-terminal to the catalytic domain, which contained two distinct proline-rich sequences consistent with the class II consensus sequence, PXXPXR, for binding to SH3 domain. Distribution of PKNbeta differed from that of PKNalpha in the following two respects: (1) Northern blotting indicated that PKNbeta mRNA could not be detected in human adult tissues, but was expressed abundantly in human cancer cell lines; (2) immunochemical analysis indicated that PKNbeta localized in nucleus and perinuclear Golgi apparatus, and was almost absent in cytoplasmic region in NIH3T3 cells. Recombinant PKNbeta expressed in COS7 cells displayed autophosphorylation and peptide kinase activity, but was found to be significantly less responsive to arachidonic acid than PKNalpha. The identification of this novel isoform underscores the diversity of PKN signaling pathway.

10484772|t|Coats' disease of the retina (unilateral retinal telangiectasis) caused by somatic mutation in the NDP gene: a role for norrin in retinal angiogenesis.
10484772|a|Coats' disease is characterized by abnormal retinal vascular development (so-called 'retinal telangiectasis') which results in massive intraretinal and subretinal lipid accumulation (exudative retinal detachment). The classical form of Coats' disease is almost invariably isolated, unilateral and seen in males. A female with a unilateral variant of Coats' disease gave birth to a son affected by Norrie disease. Both carried a missense mutation within the NDP gene on chromosome Xp11.2. Subsequently analysis of the retinas of nine enucleated eyes from males with Coats' disease demonstrated in one a somatic mutation in the NDP gene which was not present within non-retinal tissue. We suggest that Coats' telangiectasis is secondary to somatic mutation in the NDP gene which results in a deficiency of norrin (the protein product of the NDP gene) within the developing retina. This supports recent observations that the protein is critical for normal retinal vasculogenesis.

10484773|t|A common polymorphic allele of the human luteinizing hormone beta-subunit gene: additional mutations and differential function of the promoter sequence.
10484773|a|A common genetic variant (V) of the human luteinizing hormone (LH) beta-subunit gene was recently discovered. The V-LH molecules have higher bioactivity in vitro, but shorter half-life in circulation, which apparently is related to the alterations of LH function observed in individuals homo- and heterozygous for the V-LHbeta allele. We have now studied whether additional mutations in the V-LHbeta promoter sequence could contribute to the altered physiology of the LH variant molecules. The 661 bp 5'-flanking region of the V-LHbeta gene, retrieved from human genomic DNA by PCR, contained eight single-nucleotide changes, as compared with the wild-type (wt) LHbeta promoter. The finding was consistent in DNA samples of different ethnic groups. Reporter constructs with various lengths of the wt- and V-LH promoter sequences, driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene, were transfected into an immortalized mouse pituitary cell line, LbetaT(2), known to express the endogenous LHbeta gene, and into a non-endocrine human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK 293. Basal expression levels of the V-LHbeta promoter constructs were on average 36% higher in LbetaT(2)cells ( P < 0.001; n = 29), and 40% higher in HEK 293 cells ( P < 0.001; n = 16), as compared with the respective wt sequences. Numerous qualitative and quantitative differences were found between the two cell lines in responses of the two promoter sequences to stimulation with 12- O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, forskolin, 8-bromo-cAMP, progesterone and gonado- tropin-releasing hormone. In conclusion, the V-LHbeta promoter has higher basal activity, and differs in response to hormonal stimulation, as compared with the wt-LHbeta promoter. The altered promoter function of the V-LHbeta gene provides evidence for differences in regulation of the wt- and V-LHbeta genes, which may contribute to the differences observed in pituitary-gonadal function between carriers of the two LHbeta alleles. The findings also suggest a novel evolutionary mechanism whereby polymorphic changes resulting in altered bioactivity of a gene product may be compensated for by additional mutations in the cognate promoter sequence, changing transcription of the same gene.

10484776|t|The gene encoding hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is mutated in patients with primary hyperoxaluria type II.
10484776|a|Primary hyperoxaluria type II (PH2) is a rare monogenic disorder that is characterized by a lack of the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of hydroxypyruvate to D-glycerate, the reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate and the oxidation of D-glycerate to hydroxypyruvate. The disease is characterized by an elevated urinary excretion of oxalate and L-glycerate. The increased oxalate excretion can cause nephrolithiasis and nephrocalci-nosis and can, in some cases, result in renal failure and systemic oxalate deposition. We identified a glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) cDNA clone from a human liver expressed sequence tag (EST) library. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified a 1198 nucleotide clone that encoded a 984 nucleotide open reading frame. The open reading frame encodes a predicted 328 amino acid protein with a mass of 35 563 Da. Transient transfection of the cDNA clone into COS cells verified that it encoded an enzyme with hydroxy-pyruvate reductase, glyoxylate reductase and D-glycerate dehydrogenase enzymatic activities. Database analysis of human ESTs reveals widespread tissue expression, indicating that the enzyme may have a previously unrecognized role in metabolism. The genomic structure of the human GRHPR gene was determined and contains nine exons and eight introns and spans approximately 9 kb pericentromeric on chromosome 9. Four PH2 patients representing two pairs of siblings from two unrelated families were analyzed for mutations in GRHPR by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. All four patients were homozygous for a single nucleotide deletion at codon 35 in exon 2, resulting in a premature stop codon at codon 45. The cDNA that we have identified represents the first characterization of an animal GRHPR sequence. The data we present will facilitate future genetic testing to confirm the clinical diagnosis of PH2. These data will also facilitate heterozygote testing and prenatal testing in families affected with PH2 to aid in genetic counseling.

10484778|t|Ectodysplasin is a collagenous trimeric type II membrane protein with a tumor necrosis factor-like domain and co-localizes with cytoskeletal structures at lateral and apical surfaces of cells.
10484778|a|Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) is a human genetic disorder of impaired ectodermal appendage development. The EDA gene encodes isoforms of a novel transmembrane protein, ectodysplasin. The sequence of the longest isoform includes an interrupted collagenous domain of 19 Gly-X-Y repeats and a motif conserved in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related ligand family. In order to understand better the function of the ectodysplasin protein molecule and its domains, we have studied the processing and localization of wild-type and mutated isoforms in transfected human fetal kidney 293 and monkey kidney COS-1 cells. Similar to other members of collagenous membrane proteins and members of TNF-related ligands, ectodysplasin is a type II membrane protein and it forms trimers. The membrane localization of ectodysplasin is asymmetrical: it is found on the apical and lateral surfaces of the cells where it co-localizes with cytoskeletal structures. The TNF-like motif and cysteines found near the C-terminus are necessary for correct transport to the cell membrane, but the intracellular and collagenous domains are not required for the localization pattern. Our results suggest that ectodysplasin is a new member in the TNF-related ligand family involved in the early epithelial-mesenchymal interaction that regulates ectodermal appendage formation.

10597216|t|Bis, a Bcl-2-binding protein that synergizes with Bcl-2 in preventing cell death.
10597216|a|Bcl-2 is the best characterized inhibitor of apoptosis, although the molecular basis of this action is not fully understood. Using a protein interaction cloning procedure, we identified a human gene designated as bis (mapped to chromosome 10q25) that encoded a novel Bcl-2-interacting protein. Bis protein showed no significant homology with Bcl-2 family proteins and had no prominent functional motif. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that Bis interacted with Bcl-2 in vivo. DNA transfection experiments indicated that Bis itself exerted only weak anti-apoptotic activity, but was synergistic with Bcl-2 in preventing Bax-induced and Fas-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that Bis is a novel modulator of cellular anti-apoptotic activity that functions through its interaction with Bcl-2.

10639512|t|BCAR1, a human homologue of the adapter protein p130Cas, and antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer cells.
10639512|a|BACKGROUND: Treatment of breast cancer with the antiestrogen tamoxifen is effective in approximately one half of the patients with estrogen receptor-positive disease, but tumors recur frequently because of the development of metastases that are resistant to tamoxifen. We have previously shown that mutagenesis of human estrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells by insertion of a defective retrovirus genome caused the cells to become antiestrogen resistant. In this study, we isolated and characterized the crucial gene at the breast cancer antiestrogen resistance 1 (BCAR1) locus. METHODS/RESULTS: Transfer of the BCAR1 locus from retrovirus-mutated, antiestrogen-resistant cells to estrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 cells by cell fusion conferred an antiestrogen-resistant phenotype on the recipient cells. The complete coding sequence of BCAR1 was isolated by use of exon-trapping and complementary DNA (cDNA) library screening. Sequence analysis of human BCAR1 cDNA predicted a protein of 870 amino acids that was strongly homologous to rat p130Cas-adapter protein. Genomic analysis revealed that BCAR1 consists of seven exons and is located at chromosome 16q23.1. BCAR1 transcripts were detected in multiple human tissues and were similar in size to transcripts produced by retrovirus-mutated ZR-75-1 cells. Transfection of BCAR1 cDNA into ZR-75-1 cells again resulted in sustained cell proliferation in the presence of antiestrogens, confirming that BCAR1 was the responsible gene in the locus. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of the BCAR1 gene confers antiestrogen resistance on human ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. Overexpression of BCAR1 in retrovirus-mutated cells appears to result from activation of the gene's promoter. The isolation and characterization of this gene open new avenues to elucidating mechanisms by which the growth of human breast cancer becomes independent of estrogen.

10661407|t|Langerin, a novel C-type lectin specific to Langerhans cells, is an endocytic receptor that induces the formation of Birbeck granules.
10661407|a|We have identified a type II Ca2+-dependent lectin displaying mannose-binding specificity, exclusively expressed by Langerhans cells (LC), and named Langerin. LC are uniquely characterized by Birbeck granules (BG), which are organelles consisting of superimposed and zippered membranes. Here, we have shown that Langerin is constitutively associated with BG and that antibody to Langerin is internalized into these structures. Remarkably, transfection of Langerin cDNA into fibroblasts created a compact network of membrane structures with typical features of BG. Langerin is thus a potent inducer of membrane superimposition and zippering leading to BG formation. Our data suggest that induction of BG is a consequence of the antigen-capture function of Langerin, allowing routing into these organelles and providing access to a nonclassical antigen-processing pathway.

10684944|t|Cloning and characterisation of the Sry-related transcription factor gene Sox8.
10684944|a|SOX proteins form a large family of transcription factors related by a DNA-binding domain known as the HMG box. Some 30 Sox genes have been identified in mammals and orthologues have been found in a wide range of other metazoans. Sox genes are highly conserved and are known to play important roles in embryonic development, including roles in gonadal, central nervous system, neural crest and skeletal development. Several SOX genes have been implicated in human congenital diseases. We report here the isolation of Sox8 and its characterisation in mice and humans. This gene has a remarkably similar primary structure and genomic organisation to the campomelic dysplasia gene SOX9 and the Waardenburg-Shah syndrome gene SOX10. SOX8 protein is able to bind to canonical SOX target DNA sequences and activate transcription in vitro through two separate trans -activation regions. Further, Sox8 is expressed in the central nervous system, limbs, kidneys, gonads and craniofacial structures during mouse embryo development. Sox8 maps to the t complex on mouse chromosome 17 and to human chromosome 16p13.3, a region associated with the microphthalmia-cataract syndrome CATM and the alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome ATR-16.

10707983|t|Syntaphilin: a syntaxin-1 clamp that controls SNARE assembly.
10707983|a|Syntaxin-1 is a key component of the synaptic vesicle docking/fusion machinery that forms the SNARE complex with VAMP/synaptobrevin and SNAP-25. Identifying proteins that modulate SNARE complex formation is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurotransmitter release and its modulation. We have cloned and characterized a protein called syntaphilin that is selectively expressed in brain. Syntaphilin competes with SNAP-25 for binding to syntaxin-1 and inhibits SNARE complex formation by absorbing free syntaxin-1. Transient overexpression of syntaphilin in cultured hippocampal neurons significantly reduces neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, introduction of syntaphilin into presynaptic superior cervical ganglion neurons in culture inhibits synaptic transmission. These findings suggest that syntaphilin may function as a molecular clamp that controls free syntaxin-1 availability for the assembly of the SNARE complex, and thereby regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

10715554|t|Human follicle stimulating hormone receptor variants lacking transmembrane domains display altered post-translational conformations.
10715554|a|Variant splicing of gonadotropin receptor mRNA commonly occurs, however expression of receptor protein variants and their trafficking has yet to be studied in detail. To determine receptor variant trafficking and intracellular processing in mammalian cells, the intracellular fate of intentionally truncated variants of human follicle stimulating hormone receptor (hFSH-R) expressed in CHO cells was examined. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were made against the hFSH-R's extracellular domain (ECD) expressed in insect cells. Four mAbs 106.156, 106.290, 106.318, and 106.263 were chosen as probes. Epitope mapping using synthetic peptides, and truncated hFSH-R variants revealed that mAb 106.156 bound to ECD residues 183-220, while mAbs 106.318, 106.290, 106.263 bound ECD residues 300-331. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that mAbs 106.318 and 106.156 stained the surface of fixed, intact CHO cells expressing wild type hFSH-R. However, following cell permeabilization all four antibodies stained hFSH-R in Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. Permeabilized cells expressing truncated variants ECD213 and ECD254 showed staining accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope continuum. ECD335/His was found to accumulate in extended endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER location of ECD335/His was confirmed by double labeling experiments with concanavalin A and ECD mAb. Glycosidase digestion followed by Western blot analysis show ECD213 and ECD335/His to be glycosylated, but not ECD254. Both glycosylated truncated hFSH-R variants were sensitive to peptide-N-glycanase F and endoglycosidase H but insensitive to neuraminidase indicating that these variants possess high mannose type oligosaccharides. Thus truncated hFSH-R variants do not reach the medial or trans Golgi where high mannose oligosaccharides are trimmed and sialic acid is added. These data suggest that the conformation the ECD of the wild type receptor is different from the ECD alone expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. This information suggests that the ECD serves two distinct roles; the first is to bind FSH and the other is likely to contact the endodomain of the receptor, which presumably leads to activation of the endodomain for signal transduction.

10722718|t|The pro-alpha3(V) collagen chain. Complete primary structure, expression domains in adult and developing tissues, and comparison to the structures and expression domains of the other types V and XI procollagen chains.
10722718|a|The low abundance fibrillar collagen type V is widely distributed in tissues as an alpha1(V)(2)alpha2(V) heterotrimer that helps regulate the diameters of fibrils of the abundant collagen type I. Mutations in the alpha1(V) and alpha2(V) chain genes have been identified in some cases of classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), in which aberrant collagen fibrils are associated with connective tissue fragility, particularly in skin and joints. Type V collagen also exists as an alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimer that has remained poorly characterized chiefly due to inability to obtain the complete primary structure or nucleic acid probes for the alpha3(V) chain or its biosynthetic precursor, pro-alpha3(V). Here we provide human and mouse full-length pro-alpha3(V) sequences. Pro-alpha3(V) is shown to be closely related to the alpha1(V) precursor, pro-alpha1(V), but with marked differences in N-propeptide sequences, and collagenous domain features that provide insights into the low melting temperature of alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimers, lack of heparin binding by alpha3(V) chains and the possibility that alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimers are incorporated into heterotypic fibrils. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos detects alpha3(V) expression primarily in the epimysial sheaths of developing muscles and within nascent ligaments adjacent to forming bones and in joints. This distribution, and the association of alpha1(V), alpha2(V), and alpha3(V) chains in heterotrimers, suggests the human alpha3(V) gene COL5A3 as a candidate locus for at least some cases of classical EDS in which the alpha1(V) and alpha2(V) genes have been excluded, and for at least some cases of the hypermobility type of EDS, a condition marked by gross joint laxity and chronic musculoskeletal pain. COL5A3 is mapped to 19p13.2 near a polymorphic marker that should be useful in analyzing linkage with EDS and other disease phenotypes.

10722742|t|Mdm2 is a RING finger-dependent ubiquitin protein ligase for itself and p53.
10722742|a|Mdm2 has been shown to regulate p53 stability by targeting the p53 protein for proteasomal degradation. We now report that Mdm2 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) for p53 and that its activity is dependent on its RING finger. Furthermore, we show that Mdm2 mediates its own ubiquitination in a RING finger-dependent manner, which requires no eukaryotic proteins other than ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). It is apparent, therefore, that Mdm2 manifests an intrinsic capacity to mediate ubiquitination. Mutation of putative zinc coordination residues abrogated this activity, as did chelation of divalent cations. After cation chelation, the full activity could be restored by addition of zinc. We further demonstrate that the degradation of p53 and Mdm2 in cells requires additional potential zinc-coordinating residues beyond those required for the intrinsic activity of Mdm2 in vitro. Replacement of the Mdm2 RING with that of another protein (Praja1) reconstituted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Mdm2. However, this RING was ineffective in ubiquitination and proteasomal targeting of p53, suggesting that there may be specificity at the level of the RING in the recognition of heterologous substrates.

10722749|t|Identification of endoglycan, a member of the CD34/podocalyxin family of sialomucins.
10722749|a|CD34 and podocalyxin are structurally related sialomucins, which are expressed in multiple tissues including vascular endothelium and hematopoietic progenitors. These glycoproteins have been proposed to be involved in processes as diverse as glomerular filtration, inhibition of stem cell differentiation, and leukocyte-endothelial adhesion. Using homologies present in the cytoplasmic tails of these proteins, we have identified a novel member of this family, which we designate endoglycan. This protein shares a similar overall domain structure with the other family members including a sialomucin domain, but also possesses an extremely acidic amino-terminal region. In addition, endoglycan contains several potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites and is modified with chondroitin sulfate. Endoglycan mRNA and protein were detected in both endothelial cells and CD34(+) bone marrow cells. Thus, CD34, podocalyxin, and endoglycan comprise a family of sialomucins sharing both structural similarity and sequence homology, which are expressed by both endothelium and multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. While the members of this family may perform overlapping functions at these sites, the unique structural features of endoglycan suggest distinct functions for this molecule.

10727470|t|Identification of a human follicular dendritic cell molecule that stimulates germinal center B cell growth.
10727470|a|The initial interaction between B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) appears to be essential for germinal center (GC) formation. To identify molecules regulating this interaction, we generated FDC-staining monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and screened them for their ability to block FDC-mediated costimulation of growth and differentiation of CD40-stimulated B cells. Using one of the inhibitory mAbs, 8D6, we expression cloned the cDNA encoding the 8D6 antigen (Ag) from a human FDC line, HK. The 8D6 Ag is a novel protein of 282 amino acids that is expressed abundantly on FDCs. Monolayers of COS cells transiently transfected with the 8D6 Ag cDNA stimulate B cell growth. The mAb 8D6 blocks the costimulatory function completely. The inhibitory activity of the mAb 8D6 was demonstrated to be due to an inhibition of cell cycle progression of CD40 ligand-stimulated GC B cells. In addition, the mAb 8D6 inhibits the growth of a lymphoma of GC origin, L3055, which depends on FDCs or HK cells for its growth. These findings suggest that the primary function of FDCs in the GC is to stimulate B cell growth. An FDC signal molecule, 8D6 Ag, may be an important molecule to mediate this function.

10753822|t|Neutrophil polarity and locomotion are associated with surface redistribution of leukosialin (CD43), an antiadhesive membrane molecule.
10753822|a|This study analyzed the behavior of an antiadhesive membrane molecule, CD43, in neutrophil polarization and locomotion. CD43 cross-linking by antibodies induced neutrophil locomotion, with CD43 molecules clustered at the uropod of polarized neutrophils. In contrast, CD11b/CD18 cross-linking by antibodies did not affect either cell polarization or locomotion. Stimulation of suspended or adherent neutrophils with chemotactic peptide results in cell polarization and locomotion and a concomitant redistribution of CD43 to the uropod. This process is entirely reversible. The study also investigated which actin-binding protein could be involved in CD43 lateral redistribution. alpha-Actinin and moesin are preferentially adsorbed on Sepharose beads bearing a recombinant CD43 intracellular domain. Analysis by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy shows a codistribution of moesin during CD43 lateral redistribution. By contrast, alpha-actinin is located at the leading edge, an area devoid of CD43. These results shed new light on the role of CD43 membrane redistribution, which appears to be directly related to neutrophil polarity and locomotion. (Blood. 2000;95:2462-2470)

10753868|t|A G protein-coupled receptor for UDP-glucose.
10753868|a|Uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose) has a well established biochemical role as a glycosyl donor in the enzymatic biosynthesis of carbohydrates. It is less well known that UDP-glucose may possess pharmacological activity, suggesting that a receptor for this molecule may exist. Here, we show that UDP-glucose, and some closely related molecules, potently activate the orphan G protein-coupled receptor KIAA0001 heterologously expressed in yeast or mammalian cells. Nucleotides known to activate P2Y receptors were inactive, indicating the distinctly novel pharmacology of this receptor. The receptor is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues, including many regions of the brain. These data suggest that some sugar-nucleotides may serve important physiological roles as extracellular signaling molecules in addition to their familiar role in intermediary metabolism.

10753886|t|Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 mutation alters P-type calcium channel function.
10753886|a|Abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with a predominant loss of the Purkinje cell. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNA from mouse Purkinje cells revealed a predominant expression of the alpha1A channel lacking an asparagine-proline (NP) stretch in the domain IV (alpha1A(-NP)). Human alpha1A channels carrying various polyglutamine length with or without NP were expressed in HEK293 cells, and channel properties were compared using a whole-cell voltage clamp technique. alpha1A(-NP), corresponding to P-type channel, with 24 and 28 polyglutamines found in patients showed the voltage dependence of inactivation shifting negatively by 6 and 11 mV, respectively, from the 13 polyglutamine control. Contrarily, the alpha1A channel with NP (alpha1A(+NP)), corresponding to Q-type channel, with 28 polyglutamines exhibited a positive shift of 5 mV. These results suggest that altered function of alpha1A(-NP) may contribute to degeneration of Purkinje cells, which express predominantly alpha1A(-NP), due to the reduced Ca(2+) influx resulting from the negative shift of voltage-dependent inactivation. On the other hand, other types of neurons, expressing both alpha1A(-NP) and alpha1A(+NP), may survive because the positive shift of voltage-dependent inactivation of alpha1A(+NP) compensates Ca(2+) influx.

10773454|t|Structure, mapping and expression of the human gene encoding the homeodomain protein, SIX2.
10773454|a|Vertebrate genes with sequence similarity to the Drosophila homeobox gene, sine oculis (so), constitute the SIX family. There is notable expression of members of this family in anterior neural structures, and several SIX genes have been shown to play roles in vertebrate and insect development, or have been implicated in maintenance of the differentiated state of tissues. Mutations in three of these genes in man (SIX5, SIX6 and SIX3) are associated with severe phenotypes, and therefore, the cloning of other human genes from this family is of interest. We have cloned and characterised the gene that encodes human SIX2, elucidated its gene structure and conducted expression studies in a range of tissues. SIX2 is widely expressed in the late first-trimester fetus, but has a limited range of expression sites in the adult. The expression pattern of SIX2 and its localisation to chromosome 2p15-p16 will be of use in assessing its candidacy in human developmental disorders.

10803599|t|Enhanced growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells overexpressing parathyroid hormone-related peptide.
10803599|a|PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) is a secreted protein produced by breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. Because of its structural similarity to PTH at the amino terminus, the two proteins interact with a common cell surface receptor, the PTH/PTHrP receptor. When overproduced by tumor cells, PTHrP enters the circulation, giving rise to the common paraneoplastic syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Although initially discovered in malignancies, PTHrP is now known to be produced by most cells and tissues in the body. It acts as an autocrine and paracrine mediator of cell proliferation and differentiation, effects which are mediated via the PTH/PTHrP receptor. Recent evidence also has shown that, directly after translation, PTHrP is able to enter the nucleus and/or nucleolus and influence cell cycle progression and apoptosis. In this study, we have either overproduced PTHrP or inhibited endogenous PTHrP production in the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Overexpression of PTHrP was associated with an increase in mitogenesis, whereas inhibiting endogenous PTHrP production resulted in decreased cell proliferation. The overexpressed peptide targeted to the perinuclear space. In contrast, PTHrP interaction with the cell surface PTH/PTHrP receptor resulted in decreased cell proliferation in the same cell line. This latter effect is dependent on interaction with the receptor, in that exogenously added PTHrP moieties known not to interact with the receptor had no effect on cell growth. Furthermore, neutralization of added peptide with an anti-PTHrP antiserum completely abolished the growth inhibitory effects. In contrast, this antibody has no effect on the increased proliferation rate of the MCF-7 transfectants that overexpress PTHrP, compared with control cells. The net effect of autocrine/paracrine and intracrine effects of PTHrP in MCF-7 cells overproducing the peptide is accelerated cell growth. These findings have critical implications regarding the role of PTHrP in breast cancer, and they suggest that controlling PTHrP production in breast cancer may be useful therapeutically.

10834846|t|Intracellular parasitism by the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis bacterium through the P-selectin ligand, PSGL-1.
10834846|a|Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) is a febrile tick-borne illness caused by a recently discovered intracellular bacterium remarkable for its tropism for professionally phagocytic neutrophils. Monoclonal antibodies against the P-selectin binding domain of the leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand, PSGL-1, prevented HGE cell binding and infection, as did enzymatic digestion of PSGL-1. Furthermore, simultaneous neoexpression in nonsusceptible cells of complementary DNAs for both PSGL-1 and its modifying alpha-(1,3) fucosyltransferase, Fuc-TVII, allowed binding and infection by HGE. Thus, the HGE bacterium specifically bound to fucosylated leukocyte PSGL-1. Selectin mimicry is likely central to the organism's unique ability to target and infect neutrophils.

10854423|t|3-Methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (MPG protein) interacts with human RAD23 proteins.
10854423|a|Human 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (MPG protein) initiates base excision repair by severing the glycosylic bond of numerous damaged bases. In comparison, homologues of the Rad23 proteins (hHR23) and the hXPC protein are involved in the recognition of damaged bases in global genome repair, a subset of nucleotide excision repair. In this report, we show that the hHR23A and -B also interact with the MPG protein and can serve as accessory proteins for DNA damage recognition in base excision repair. Furthermore, the MPG.hHR23 protein complex elevates the rate of MPG protein-catalyzed excision from hypoxanthine-containing substrates. This increased excision rate is correlated with a greater binding affinity of the MPG protein-hHR23 protein complex for damaged DNA. These data suggest that the hHR23 proteins function as universal DNA damage recognition accessory proteins in both of these major excision repair pathways.

10873535|t|Expression, purification, and functional analysis of the human serine protease HtrA2.
10873535|a|HumHtrA2 or Omi is a recently described member of a novel family of mammalian serine proteases homologous to the Escherichia coli htrA gene product. Although the physiological function of members of this new family is unclear, the current understanding is that as well as being involved with the degradation aberrantly folded proteins during conditions of cellular stress, they may possess a chaperone-like role under normal conditions. In this report we describe the overexpression of humHtrA2 in two heterologous systems comparing the merits of each. We found that molecular analysis of processing events in Sf9 cells allowed us to revisit E. coli expression systems which were initially unsuccessful. Using E. coli we were able to produce milligram amounts of >90% pure recombinant enzyme as determined by SDS-PAGE gels. By means of fluorescently labeled substrates alpha- and beta-casein and zymography, the proteolytic activity of recombinant HumHtrA2 was also demonstrated.

10878360|t|Repression of IL-2 promoter activity by the novel basic leucine zipper p21SNFT protein.
10878360|a|IL-2 is the major autocrine and paracrine growth factor produced by T cells upon T cell stimulation. The inducible expression of IL-2 is highly regulated by multiple transcription factors, particularly AP-1, which coordinately activate the promoter. Described here is the ability of the novel basic leucine zipper protein p21SNFT to repress AP-1 activity and IL-2 transcription. A detailed analysis of the repression by p21SNFT repression on the IL-2 promoter distal NF-AT/AP-1 site demonstrates that it can bind DNA with NF-AT and Jun, strongly suggesting that it represses NF-AT/AP-1 activity by competing with Fos proteins for Jun dimerization. The importance of this repression is that p21SNFT inhibits the trans-activation potential of protein complexes that contain Jun, thereby demonstrating an additional level of control for the highly regulated, ubiquitous AP-1 transcription factor and the IL-2 gene.

10878382|t|Identification of distinct surface-expressed and intracellular CXC-chemokine receptor 2 glycoforms in neutrophils: N-glycosylation is essential for maintenance of receptor surface expression.
10878382|a|The G protein-coupled CXC-chemokine receptor CXCR-2 mediates activation of neutrophil effector functions in response to multiple ligands, including IL-8 and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2). Although CXCR-2 has been successfully cloned and expressed in several cell lines, the molecular properties of the native neutrophil-expressed receptor have remained largely undefined. Here we report on the identification and characterization of distinct CXCR-2 glycoforms and their subcellular distribution in neutrophils. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of surface-expressed receptors covalently linked to IL-8 or NAP-2 as well as in their unloaded state revealed the occurrence of a single CXCR-2 variant with an apparent size of 56 kDa. According to deglycosylation experiments surface-expressed CXCR-2 carries two N-linked 9-kDa carbohydrate moieties that are both of complex structure. In addition, two other CXCR-2 variants of 38 and 40 kDa were found to occur exclusively intracellular and to carry N-glycosylations of high mannose or hybrid type. These receptors did not participate in ligand-induced receptor trafficking, while surface-expressed CXCR-2 was internalized and re-expressed following stimulation with NAP-2. By enzymatic removal of one 9-kDa carbohydrate moiety in surface-expressed CXCR-2 we can show that neither NAP-2-induced trafficking nor signaling of the receptor is dependent on its full glycosylation. Instead, glycosylation was found to protect CXCR-2 from proteolytic attack, as even partial deglycosylation is associated with serine protease-mediated disappearance of the receptor from the neutrophil surface. Thus, although not directly involved in signaling, glycosylation appears to be required to maintain neutrophil responsiveness to CXC-chemokines during inflammation.

10880510|t|Human TREK2, a 2P domain mechano-sensitive K+ channel with multiple regulations by polyunsaturated fatty acids, lysophospholipids, and Gs, Gi, and Gq protein-coupled receptors.
10880510|a|Mechano-sensitive and fatty acid-activated K(+) belong to the structural class of K(+) channel with two pore domains. Here, we report the isolation and the characterization of a novel member of this family. This channel, called TREK2, is closely related to TREK1 (78% of homology). Its gene is located on chromosome 14q31. TREK2 is abundantly expressed in pancreas and kidney and to a lower level in brain, testis, colon, and small intestine. In the central nervous system, TREK2 has a widespread distribution with the highest levels of expression in cerebellum, occipital lobe, putamen, and thalamus. In transfected cells, TREK2 produces rapidly activating and non-inactivating outward rectifier K(+) currents. The single-channel conductance is 100 picosiemens at +40 mV in 150 mm K(+). The currents can be strongly stimulated by polyunsaturated fatty acid such as arachidonic, docosahexaenoic, and linoleic acids and by lysophosphatidylcholine. The channel is also activated by acidification of the intracellular medium. TREK2 is blocked by application of intracellular cAMP. As with TREK1, TREK2 is activated by the volatile general anesthetics chloroform, halothane, and isoflurane and by the neuroprotective agent riluzole. TREK2 can be positively or negatively regulated by a variety of neurotransmitter receptors. Stimulation of the G(s)-coupled receptor 5HT4sR or the G(q)-coupled receptor mGluR1 inhibits channel activity, whereas activation of the G(i)-coupled receptor mGluR2 increases TREK2 currents. These multiple types of regulations suggest that TREK2 plays an important role as a target of neurotransmitter action.

10880513|t|SHP2 mediates the protective effect of interleukin-6 against dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells.
10880513|a|Our previous studies have shown that activation of a related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) (also known as Pyk2) is required for dexamethasone (Dex)-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) cells and that human interleukin-6 (IL-6), a known growth and survival factor for MM cells, blocks both RAFTK activation and apoptosis induced by Dex. However, the mechanism whereby IL-6 inhibits Dex-induced apoptosis is undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 mediates this protective effect. We show that IL-6 triggers selective activation of SHP2 and its association with RAFTK in Dex-treated MM cells. SHP2 interacts with RAFTK through a region other than its Src homology 2 domains. We demonstrate that RAFTK is a direct substrate of SHP2 both in vitro and in vivo, and that Tyr(906) in the C-terminal domain of RAFTK mediates its interaction with SHP2. Moreover, overexpression of dominant negative SHP2 blocked the protective effect of IL-6 against Dex-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that SHP2 mediates the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 and suggest SHP2 as a novel therapeutic target in MM.

10896916|t|Alpha(2) adrenoceptors regulate proliferation of human intestinal epithelial cells.
10896916|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies on rodents have suggested that catecholamines stimulate proliferation of the intestinal epithelium through activation of alpha(2) adrenoceptors located on crypt cells. The occurrence of this effect awaits demonstration in humans and the molecular mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated. Here, we examined the effect of alpha(2) agonists on a clone of Caco2 cells expressing the human alpha(2A) adrenoceptor. METHODS: Cells were transfected with a bicistronic plasmid containing the alpha2C10 and neomycin phosphotransferase genes. G418 resistant clones were assayed for receptor expression using radioligand binding. Receptor functionality was assessed by testing its ability to couple Gi proteins and to inhibit cAMP production. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation was followed by western blot, and cell proliferation was estimated by measuring protein and DNA content. RESULTS: Permanent transfection of Caco2 cells allowed us to obtain a clone (Caco2-3B) expressing alpha(2A) adrenoceptors at a density similar to that found in normal human intestinal epithelium. Caco2-3B retained morphological features and brush border enzyme expression characteristic of enterocytic differentiation. The receptor was coupled to Gi2/Gi3 proteins and its stimulation caused marked diminution of forskolin induced cAMP production. Treatment of Caco2-3B with UK14304 (alpha(2) agonist) induced a rapid increase in the phosphorylation state of MAPK, extracellular regulated protein kinase 1 (Erk1), and 2 (Erk2). This event was totally abolished in pertussis toxin treated cells and in the presence of kinase inhibitors (genistein or PD98059). It was unaffected by protein kinase C downregulation but correlated with a transient increase in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, sustained exposure of Caco2-3B to UK14304 resulted in modest but significant acceleration of cell proliferation. None of these effects was observed in the parental cell line Caco2. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in the present study support a regulatory role for alpha(2) adrenoceptors in intestinal cell proliferation.

10903743|t|IL-4 enhances keratinocyte expression of CXCR3 agonistic chemokines.
10903743|a|IFN-induced protein of 10 kDa (IP-10), monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig), and IFN-inducible T-cell alpha-chemoattractant (I-TAC) belong to the non-glutamate-leucine-arginine motif CXC chemokine family and act solely through the CXCR3 receptor for potent attraction of T lymphocytes. In this study, we evaluated the capacity of the T cell-derived cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 to modulate IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC in cultured human keratinocytes and CXCR3 expression in T cells from allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). IL-4, but not IL-10 or IL-17, significantly up-regulated IFN-gamma- or TNF-alpha-induced IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC mRNA accumulation in keratinocytes and increased the levels of IP-10 and Mig in keratinocyte supernatants. Immunohistochemistry of skin affected by ACD revealed that >70% of infiltrating cells were reactive for CXCR3 and that CXCR3 staining colocalized in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Nickel-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lines established from ACD skin produced IFN-gamma and IL-4 and expressed moderate to high levels of CXCR3. Finally, CXCR3 agonistic chemokines released by stimulated keratinocytes triggered calcium mobilization in skin-derived nickel-specific CD4+ T cells and promoted their migration, with supernatant from keratinocyte cultures stimulated with IFN-gamma and IL-4 attracting more efficaciously than supernatant from keratinocytes activated with IFN-gamma alone. In conclusion, IL-4 exerts a proinflammatory function on keratinocytes by potentiating IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha induction of IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC, which in turn may determine a prominent recruitment of CXCR3+ T lymphocytes at inflammatory reaction sites.

10908648|t|The human GRAF gene is fused to MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) and both alleles are disrupted in three cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia with a deletion 5q.
10908648|a|We have isolated the human GRAF gene (for GTPase regulator associated with the focal adhesion kinase pp125(FAK)). This gene was fused with MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) that occurred in an infant with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. GRAF encodes a member of the Rho family of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family. On the protein level, it is 90% homologous to the recently described chicken GRAF gene that functions as a GAP of RhoA in vivo and is thus a critical component of the integrin signaling transduction pathway. The particular position of the human GRAF gene at 5q31 and the proposed antiproliferative and tumor suppressor properties of its avian homologue suggest that it also might be pathogenetically relevant for hematologic malignancies with deletions of 5q. To investigate this possibility, we sequenced 4-5 individual cDNA clones from 13 cases in which one allele of GRAF was deleted. We found point mutations within the GAP domain of the second GRAF allele in one patient. In two additional patients we found an insertion of 52 or 74 bp within the GRAF cDNA that generates a reading frame shift followed by a premature stop codon. GRAF maps outside the previously defined commonly deleted 5q31 region. Nevertheless, inactivation of both alleles in at least some cases suggests that deletions and mutations of the GRAF gene may be instrumental in the development and progression of hematopoeitic disorders with a del(5q).

10910894|t|LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8.
10910894|a|Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

10915768|t|Ataxin-3, the MJD1 gene product, interacts with the two human homologs of yeast DNA repair protein RAD23, HHR23A and HHR23B.
10915768|a|Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine tract near the C-terminus of the MJD1 gene product, ataxin-3. The mutant ataxin-3 forms intranuclear inclusions in cultured cells as well as in diseased human brain and also causes cell death in transfected cells. However, the normal function of ataxin-3 remains unknown. To explore the function of ataxin-3, we used the two-hybrid system to screen for the protein(s) that interacts with ataxin-3. We found that ataxin-3 interacts with two human homologs of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23, HHR23A and HHR23B. Furthermore, we confirmed that ataxin-3 interacts with the -ubiquitin-like domain at the N-terminus of the HHR23 proteins, which is important for nucleotide excision repair; however, ataxin-3 does not interact with -ubiquitin, implying that ataxin-3 might be functionally associated with the HHR23 proteins through this specific interaction. The normal and mutant ataxin-3 proteins show no difference in their ability to bind to the HHR23 proteins. However, in 293 cells HHR23A is recruited to intranuclear inclusions formed by the mutant ataxin-3 through its interaction with ataxin-3. These results suggest that this interaction is associated with the normal function of ataxin-3 and that some functional abnormality of the HHR23 proteins might exist in MJD.

10915776|t|Retinoschisin, the X-linked retinoschisis protein, is a secreted photoreceptor protein, and is expressed and released by Weri-Rb1 cells.
10915776|a|X-linked retinoschisis is characterized by microcystic-like changes of the macular region and schisis within the inner retinal layers, leading to visual deterioration in males. Many missense and protein-truncating mutations of the causative gene RS1 have now been identified and are thought to be inactivating. RS1 encodes a 224 amino acid protein, retinoschisin, which contains a discoidin domain but is of unknown function. We have generated a polyclonal antibody against a peptide from a unique region within retinoschisin, which detects a protein of approximately 28 kDa in retinal samples reduced with dithiothreitol, but multimers sized >40 kDa under non-reducing conditions. A screen of human tissues with this antibody reveals retinoschisin to be retina specific and the antibody detects a protein of similar size in bovine and murine retinae. We investigated the expression pattern in the retina of both RS1 mRNA (using in situ hybridization with riboprobes) and retinoschisin (using immunohistochemistry). The antisense riboprobe detected RS1 mRNA only in the photoreceptor layer but the protein product of the gene was present both in the photoreceptors and within the inner portions of the retina. Furthermore, differentiated retinoblastoma cells (Weri-Rb1 cells) were found to express RS1 mRNA and to release retinoschisin. These results suggest that retinoschisin is released by photo-receptors and has functions within the inner retinal layers. Thus, X-linked retinoschisis is caused by abnormalities in a putative secreted photoreceptor protein and is the first example of a secreted photo-receptor protein associated with a retinal dystrophy.

10915792|t|Identification of a common protein association region in the neuronal Cdk5 activator.
10915792|a|Cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (Cdk5) depends on the association with neuronal Cdk5 activator (Nck5a) for kinase activity. A variety of cellular proteins have been shown to undergo high affinity association with Nck5a, including three novel proteins, C42, C48, and C53 found by a yeast two-hybrid screen (Ching, Y. P., Qi, Z., and Wang, J. H. (2000) Gene 242, 285-294). The three proteins show competitive binding to Nck5a suggesting that they bind at a common site. The binding site has been mapped to a region of 26 amino acid residues (residues 145 to 170) at the N-terminal boundary of the kinase activation domain of Nck5a. This region of Nck5a contains an amphipathic alpha-helix whose hydrophobic face is involved in Cdk5 activation (Chin, K. T., Ohki, S, Tang, D., Cheng, H. C., Wang, J. H. , and Zhang, M. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 7120-7127). Several lines of evidence suggest that Nck5a interacts with the binding proteins at the hydrophilic face of the amphipathic alpha-helix. First, the Nck5a-(145-170) peptide can bind Cdk5 and Nck5a-binding proteins simultaneously. Second, the association of Nck5a-(145-170) to C48 can be markedly reduced by high ionic strength whereas the interaction between Nck5a and Cdk5 is not affected. Third, substitution of Glu(157) by glutamine in Nck5a-(145-170) abolishes the peptide's ability to bind to the three Nck5a-binding proteins without diminishing its Cdk5 binding activity.

10942362|t|CXC chemokine receptor 3 expression on CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors from human cord blood induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor: chemotaxis and adhesion induced by its ligands, interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 and monokine induced by interferon gamma.
10942362|a|CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), which is known to be expressed predominately on memory and activated T lymphocytes, is a receptor for both interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible protein 10 (gamma IP-10) and monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig). We report the novel finding that CXCR3 is also expressed on CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors from human cord blood stimulated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) but not on freshly isolated CD34(+) progenitors. Freshly isolated CD34(+) progenitors expressed low levels of CXCR3 messenger RNA, but this expression was highly up-regulated by GM-CSF, as indicated by a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique. gamma IP-10 and Mig induced chemotaxis of GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitors by means of CXCR3, since an anti-CXCR3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was found to block gamma IP-10-induced and Mig-induced CD34(+) progenitor chemotaxis. These chemotactic attracted CD34(+) progenitors are colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage. gamma IP-10 and Mig also induced GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitor adhesion and aggregation by means of CXCR3, a finding confirmed by the observation that anti-CXCR3 mAb blocked these functions of gammaIP-10 and Mig but not of chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha. gamma IP-10-induced and Mig-induced up-regulation of integrins (CD49a and CD49b) was found to play a crucial role in adhesion of GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitors. Moreover, gamma IP-10 and Mig stimulated CXCR3 redistribution and cellular polarization in GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitors. These results indicate that CXCR3-gamma IP-10 and CXCR3-Mig receptor-ligand pairs, as well as the effects of GM-CSF on them, may be especially important in the cytokine/chemokine environment for the physiologic and pathophysiologic events of differentiation of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors into lymphoid and myeloid stem cells, subsequently immune and inflammatory cells. These processes include transmigration, relocation, differentiation, and maturation of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors. (Blood. 2000;96:1230-1238)

10942389|t|HIV-1 gp120- and gp160-induced apoptosis in cultured endothelial cells is mediated by caspases.
10942389|a|The immune dysfunction and cell destruction that occur in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected host appear to result from the direct cytopathic effects of viral infection and the effects of viral proteins on uninfected bystander cells. Recently, the alpha-chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been reported to mediate apoptosis in neuronal cells and in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells after its binding to HIV-1 envelope proteins. In the current study, it was observed that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) undergo apoptosis after their treatment with the HIV-1 envelope proteins gp120/160. Anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody decreased HIV-1 gp120/160-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the CXCR4 chemokine receptor mediates the apoptotic effects of these HIV envelope glycoproteins. Further studies revealed that caspases play an important role in this process because the pretreatment of cells with a general caspase enzyme inhibitor decreased the extent of HUVEC apoptosis induced by gp120/160. In addition, it was found that caspase-3 was activated on HIV-1 gp120/160 treatment of these cells. It was also observed that gp120/160 treatment slightly increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax. These results suggest that HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins can disrupt endothelial integrity through the interaction with CXCR4, thereby facilitating virus transit out of the bloodstream and contributing to the vascular injury syndromes seen in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

10942434|t|Collagen XVIII, containing an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth, plays a critical role in the maintenance of retinal structure and in neural tube closure (Knobloch syndrome).
10942434|a|Knobloch syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive disorder defined by the occurrence of high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration with retinal detachment, macular abnormalities and occipital encephalocele. The KS causative gene had been assigned to a 4.3 cM interval at 21q22.3 by linkage analysis of a large consanguineous Brazilian family. We reconstructed the haplotypes of this family with ten additional markers (five were novel) and narrowed the candidate interval to a region of < 245 kb, which contains 24 expressed sequence tags, the KIAA0958 gene and the 5' end of the COL18A1 gene. We identified a homozygous mutation at the AG consensus acceptor splice site of COL18A1 intron 1 exclusively among the 12 KS patients, which was not found among 140 control chromosomes. This mutation predicts the creation of a stop codon in exon 4 and therefore the truncation of the alpha1(XVIII) collagen short form, which was expressed in human adult retina. These findings provide evidence that KS is caused by mutations in COL18A1 which, therefore, has a major role in determining the retinal structure as well as in the closure of the neural tube. Therefore, we show for the first time that the absence of a collagen isoform impairs embryonic cell proliferation and/or migration as a primary or secondary effect.

10962033|t|CIKS, a connection to Ikappa B kinase and stress-activated protein kinase.
10962033|a|Pathogens, inflammatory signals, and stress cause acute transcriptional responses in cells. The induced expression of genes in response to these signals invariably involves transcription factors of the NF-kappaB and AP-1/ATF families. Activation of NF-kappaB factors is thought to be mediated primarily via IkappaB kinases (IKK), whereas that of AP-1/ATF can be mediated by stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs; also named Jun kinases or JNKs). IKKalpha and IKKbeta are two catalytic subunits of a core IKK complex that also contains the regulatory subunit NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator)/IKKgamma. The latter protein is essential for activation of the IKKs, but its mechanism of action is not known. Here we describe the molecular cloning of CIKS (connection to IKK and SAPK/JNK), a previously unknown protein that directly interacts with NEMO/IKKgamma in cells. When ectopically expressed, CIKS stimulates IKK and SAPK/JNK kinases and it transactivates an NF-kappaB-dependent reporter. Activation of NF-kappaB is prevented in the presence of kinase-deficient, interfering mutants of the IKKs. CIKS may help to connect upstream signaling events to IKK and SAPK/JNK modules. CIKS could coordinate the activation of two stress-induced signaling pathways, functions reminiscent of those noted for tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor adaptor proteins.

10980615|t|Functional consequences of tumorigenic missense mutations in the amino-terminal domain of Smad4.
10980615|a|Smads, the intracellular effectors of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members, are somatically mutated at high frequency in particular types of human cancers. Certain of these mutations affect the Smad amino-terminal domain, which, in the case of Smad3 and Smad4, binds DNA. We investigated the functional consequences of four missense mutations in the Smad4 amino-terminal domain found in human tumors. The mutant proteins were found to have impaired abilities to bind DNA although they were fully capable of forming complexes with Smad3. All four Smad4 mutants showed decreased protein stability compared to wild-type Smad4. Two of the Smad4 mutants (G65V and P130S) were translocated to the nucleus and were capable of transactivating a Smad-dependent promoter in a ligand-dependent manner. In contrast, the L43S and R100T mutants were not translocated efficiently to the nucleus and consequently resulted in severely defective transcriptional responses to TGF-beta. Moreover, we demonstrate here the critical importance of two basic residues in the beta-hairpin loop of Smad3 or Smad4 for DNA binding, consistent with predictions from the Smad3 crystal structure. In addition, our results reveal that in the TGF-beta-induced heteromeric signaling complex, loss of DNA binding of Smad4 can be compensated by Smad3, however, both Smad3 and Smad4 are needed for efficient DNA binding and signaling. In conclusion, mutations in the amino-terminal domain of Smad4, that are found in cancer, show loss of multiple functional properties which may contribute to tumorigenesis.

11001923|t|Interaction between LIS1 and doublecortin, two lissencephaly gene products.
11001923|a|Mutations in either LIS1 or DCX are the most common cause for type I lissencephaly. Here we report that LIS1 and DCX interact physically both in vitro and in vivo. Epitope-tagged DCX transiently expressed in COS cells can be co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous LIS1. Furthermore, endogenous DCX could be co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous LIS1 in embryonic brain extracts, demonstrating an in vivo association. The two protein products also co-localize in transfected cells and in primary neuronal cells. In addition, we demonstrate homodimerization of DCX in vitro. Using fragments of both LIS1 and DCX, the domains of interaction were mapped. LIS1 and DCX interact with tubulin and microtubules. Our results suggest that addition of DCX and LIS1 to tubulin enhances polymerization in an additive fashion. In in vitro competition assays, when LIS1 is added first, DCX competes with LIS1 in its binding to microtubules, but when DCX is added prior to the addition of LIS1 it enhances the binding of LIS1 to microtubules. We conclude that LIS1 and DCX cross-talk is important to microtubule function in the developing cerebral cortex.

11102480|t|Localization and enhanced current density of the Kv4.2 potassium channel by interaction with the actin-binding protein filamin.
11102480|a|Kv4.2 potassium channels play a critical role in postsynaptic excitability. Immunocytochemical studies reveal a somatodendritic Kv4.2 expression pattern, with the channels concentrated mainly at dendritic spines. The molecular mechanism that underlies the localization of Kv4.2 to this subcellular region is unknown. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the Kv4.2-associated proteins that are involved in channel localization. Here we demonstrate a direct interaction between Kv4.2 and the actin-binding protein, filamin. We show that Kv4.2 and filamin can be coimmunoprecipitated both in vitro and in brain and that Kv4.2 and filamin share an overlapping expression pattern in the cerebellum and cultured hippocampal neurons. To examine the functional consequences of this interaction, we expressed Kv4.2 in filamin(+) and filamin(-) cells and performed immunocytochemical and electrophysiological analyses. Our results indicate that Kv4.2 colocalizes with filamin at filopodial roots in filamin(+) cells but shows a nonspecific expression pattern in filamin(-) cells, with no localization to filopodial roots. Furthermore, the magnitude of whole-cell Kv4.2 current density is approximately 2.7-fold larger in filamin(+) cells as compared with these currents in filamin(-) cells. We propose that filamin may function as a scaffold protein in the postsynaptic density, mediating a direct link between Kv4.2 and the actin cytoskeleton, and that this interaction is essential for the generation of appropriate Kv4.2 current densities.

11137999|t|Insertion of beta-satellite repeats identifies a transmembrane protease causing both congenital and childhood onset autosomal recessive deafness.
11137999|a|Approximately 50% of childhood deafness is caused by mutations in specific genes. Autosomal recessive loci account for approximately 80% of nonsyndromic genetic deafness. Here we report the identification of a new transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS3; also known as ECHOS1) expressed in many tissues, including fetal cochlea, which is mutated in the families used to describe both the DFNB10 and DFNB8 loci. An 8-bp deletion and insertion of 18 monomeric (approximately 68-bp) beta-satellite repeat units, normally present in tandem arrays of up to several hundred kilobases on the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes, causes congenital deafness (DFNB10). A mutation in a splice-acceptor site, resulting in a 4-bp insertion in the mRNA and a frameshift, was detected in childhood onset deafness (DFNB8). This is the first description of beta-satellite insertion into an active gene resulting in a pathogenic state, and the first description of a protease involved in hearing loss.

11207365|t|A human BRCA2 complex containing a structural DNA binding component influences cell cycle progression.
11207365|a|Germline mutations of the human BRCA2 gene confer susceptibility to breast cancer. Although the function of the BRCA2 protein remains to be determined, murine cells homozygous for BRCA2 inactivation display chromosomal aberrations. We have isolated a 2 MDa BRCA2-containing complex and identified a structural DNA binding component, designated as BRCA2-Associated Factor 35 (BRAF35). BRAF35 contains a nonspecific DNA binding HMG domain and a kinesin-like coiled coil domain. Similar to BRCA2, BRAF35 mRNA expression levels in mouse embryos are highest in proliferating tissues with high mitotic index. Strikingly, nuclear staining revealed a close association of BRAF35/BRCA2 complex with condensed chromatin coincident with histone H3 phosphorylation. Importantly, antibody microinjection experiments suggest a role for BRCA2/BRAF35 complex in modulation of cell cycle progression.

11210186|t|Cloning, expression and chromosomal location of NKX6B TO 10Q26, a region frequently deleted in brain tumors.
11210186|a|Nkx6-2 (former Gtx) is a murine-homeobox-containing gene localized distally on Chromosome (Chr) 7. Analysis of the expression pattern, together with DNA binding assays, suggests that this gene product might be important for differentiated oligodendrocyte function and in the regulation of myelin gene expression. We now report on the cloning and characterization of the human homolog (NKX6B). DNA sequence analysis of an 11-kb genomic fragment revealed that the complete human gene spans 1.2 kb and is composed of three exons. NKX6B is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 277 amino acids with 97% identity to mouse Nkx6-2. Northern blot experiments showed that NKX6B expression is tightly controlled in a tissue-specific fashion with the highest site of expression being the brain. Finally, using STS content mapping and RH analyis, we demonstrated that NKX6B maps to the 10q26, a region where frequent loss of heterozygosity has been observed in various malignant brain tumors. These results may implicate NKX6B as a candidate tumor suppressor gene for brain tumors, particularly for oligodendrogliomas.

11461089|t|Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) upregulates BCL-2 and inhibits apoptosis in human and murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells.
11461089|a|Tumour progression is regulated by the balance of proliferation and apoptosis in the tumour cell population. To date, the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumour growth has been attributed to the induction of angiogenesis. VEGF has been shown to be a survival factor for endothelial cells, preventing apoptosis by inducing Bcl-2 expression. In both murine (4T1) and human (MDA-MB-231) metastatic mammary carcinoma cell lines, we found that VEGF upregulated Bcl-2 expression and anti-VEGF antibodies reduced Bcl-2 expression. These alterations in Bcl-2 expression were reflected by the levels of tumour cell apoptosis. VEGF resulted in reduced tumour cell apoptosis, whereas its inhibition with anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies induced apoptosis directly in tumour cells. Therefore, in addition to its role in angiogenesis and vessel permeability, VEGF acts as a survival factor for tumour cells, inducing Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting tumour cell apoptosis.

11591762|t|Endothelial cell costimulation of T cell activation through CD58-CD2 interactions involves lipid raft aggregation.
11591762|a|Human endothelial cells (EC) costimulate CD4(+) memory T cell activation through CD58-CD2 interactions. In this study we tested the hypothesis that EC activate distinct costimulatory pathways in T cells that target specific transcription factors. AP-1, composed of fos and jun proteins, is a critical effector of TCR signaling and binds several sites in the IL-2 promoter. EC augment c-fos promoter activity in T cells; however, deletion analysis reveals no transcription factor binding sites in the promoter uniquely responsive to EC costimulation. Overexpression of AP-1 proteins in T cells augments the activity of an AP-1-luciferase reporter gene equally in the absence or the presence of EC costimulation. Interestingly, EC stimulate a similar 2- to 3-fold up-regulation of AP-1, NF-AT, NF-kappaB, and NF-IL-2-luciferase reporters. CD2 mAbs completely block EC effects on all of these pathways, as well as costimulation of IL-2 secretion. We conclude that EC costimulation through CD2 does not trigger a single distinct costimulatory pathway in T cells, but rather, it amplifies several pathways downstream of the TCR. Indeed, we find that early EC costimulation acts " upstream " of the TCR by promoting lipid raft aggregation, thus amplifying TCR signaling. Soluble CD2 mAbs block EC-induced raft aggregation, whereas cross-linking CD2 promotes aggregation. These data are consistent with the critical role of CD2 in organizing the T cell-APC contact zone.

11997383|t|AMP-activated protein kinase suppresses protein synthesis in rat skeletal muscle through down-regulated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling.
11997383|a|AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is viewed as an energy sensor that acts to modulate glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Given that protein synthesis is a high energy-consuming process, it may be transiently depressed during cellular energy stress. Thus, the intent of this investigation was to examine whether AMPK activation modulates the translational control of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. Injections of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-d-ribonucleoside (AICAR) were used to activate AMPK in male rats. The activity of alpha1 AMPK remained unchanged in gastrocnemius muscle from AICAR-treated animals compared with controls, whereas alpha2 AMPK activity was significantly increased (51%). AICAR treatment resulted in a reduction in protein synthesis to 45% of the control value. This depression was associated with decreased activation of protein kinases in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase B on Ser(473), mTOR on Ser(2448), ribosomal protein S6 kinase on Thr(389), and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein on Thr(37). A reduction in eIF4E associated with eIF4G to 10% of the control value was also noted. In contrast, eIF2B activity remained unchanged in response to AICAR treatment and therefore would not appear to contribute to the depression in protein synthesis. This is the first investigation to demonstrate changes in translation initiation and skeletal muscle protein synthesis in response to AMPK activation.

12117771|t|Protocadherin LKC, a new candidate for a tumor suppressor of colon and liver cancers, its association with contact inhibition of cell proliferation.
12117771|a|Protocadherins are a major subfamily of the cadherin superfamily, but little is known about their functions and intracellular signal transduction. We cloned a novel human protocadherin gene, containing seven EC domains, and identified functional aspects of this gene. The gene was predominantly expressed in liver, kidney and colon tissues, and was thus designated Protocadherin LKC. The expression of Protocadherin LKC is markedly reduced in cancers arising from these tissues at both transcriptional and protein levels. To investigate the effects of Protocadherin LKC expression in colon cancer, we introduced the gene into colon cancer cell line HCT116, which does not express this gene. Significantly, Protocadherin LKC expression induced contact inhibition of cell proliferation although it did not affect growth rate. When grown to post-confluence in monolayer cells cultures, Protocadherin LKC-expressing HCT116 no longer formed multiple cell layers and showed the typical paving stone morphology of normal epithelial cells. Furthermore, expression of Protocadherin LKC suppressed tumor formation of HCT116 cells in a nude mouse model. In addition, we identified a protein, hMAST205 (microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-205 kDa), which interacted with Protocadherin LKC; the interaction occurring between the PDZ domain of hMAST205 and C-terminal tail of Protocadherin LKC. Our results suggest that Protocadherin LKC, which directly binds PDZ protein, is a molecular switch for contact inhibition of epithelial cells in the liver, kidney and colon tissues.

12140263|t|Daxx and histone deacetylase II associate with chromatin through an interaction with core histones and the chromatin-associated protein Dek.
12140263|a|Human Daxx is a protein that functions, in part, as a transcriptional co-repressor through its interaction with a growing number of nuclear, DNA-associated proteins. To determine the mechanism by which hDaxx represses transcription, we used conventional chromatography to isolate endogenous hDaxx. We determined that hDaxx has an apparent molecular weight of 360 kDa, which is consistent with the fact that multiple domains of hDaxx are required for transcriptional repression and suggests that hDaxx associates with multiple proteins. Using co-fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that hDaxx associates with proteins that are critical for transcriptional repression, such as histone deacetylase II, constituents of chromatin such as core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, and Dek, a chromatin-associated protein reported to change the topology of DNA in chromatin in vitro. We also demonstrate a requirement for the SPT domain and the first paired amphipathic helix of hDaxx for its association with histone deacetylase II and acetylated histone H4, respectively. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that the association of hDaxx with chromatin-related proteins is dependent on the post-translational phosphorylation status of hDaxx. A working model for the repressive action of hDaxx through its association with chromatin related proteins is presented.

12194817|t|Regulation of human separase by securin binding and autocleavage.
12194817|a|BACKGROUND: Sister chromatid separation is initiated by separase, a protease that cleaves cohesin and thereby dissolves sister chromatid cohesion. Separase is activated by the degradation of its inhibitor securin and by the removal of inhibitory phosphates. In human cells, separase activation also coincides with the cleavage of separase, but it is not known if this reaction activates separase, which protease cleaves separase, and how separase cleavage is regulated.RESULTS: Inhibition of separase expression in human cells by RNA interference causes the formation of polyploid cells with large lobed nuclei. In mitosis, many of these cells contain abnormal chromosome plates with unseparated sister chromatids. Inhibitor binding experiments in vitro reveal that securin prevents the access of substrate analogs to the active site of separase. Upon securin degradation, the active site of full-length separase becomes accessible, allowing rapid autocatalytic cleavage of separase at one of three sites. The resulting N- and C-terminal fragments remain associated and can be reinhibited by securin. A noncleavable separase mutant retains its ability to cleave cohesin in vitro.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that separase is required for sister chromatid separation during mitosis in human cells. Our data further indicate that securin inhibits separase by blocking the access of substrates to the active site of separase. Securin proteolysis allows autocatalytic processing of separase into a cleaved form, but separase cleavage is not essential for separase activation.

12407027|t|Contribution of CD3 gamma to TCR regulation and signaling in human mature T lymphocytes.
12407027|a|CD3 proteins may have redundant as well as specific contributions to the intracellular propagation and final effector responses of TCR-mediated signals at different checkpoints during T cell differentiation. We report here on the participation of CD3 gamma in the activation and effector function of human mature T lymphocytes at the antigen recognition checkpoint. Following TCR-CD3 engagement of human CD3 gamma-deficient T cell lines, and despite their lower TCR-CD3 surface levels compared to normal controls, mature T cell responses such as protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the regulation of expression of several cell surface molecules, including the TCR-CD3 itself, were either normal or only slightly affected. In contrast, other physiological responses like the specific adhesion and concomitant cell polarization on ICAM-1-coated dishes were selectively defective, and activation-induced cell death was increased. Our data indicate that CD3 gamma contributes essential specialized signaling functions to certain mature T cell responses. Failure to generate appropriate interactions may abort cytoskeleton reorganization and initiate an apoptotic response.

12475894|t|ADAM10-mediated cleavage of L1 adhesion molecule at the cell surface and in released membrane vesicles.
12475894|a|Cells can release membrane components in a soluble form and as membrane vesicles. L1, an important molecule for cell migration of neural and tumor cells, is released by membrane-proximal cleavage, and soluble L1 promotes cell migration. Release of L1 is enhanced by shedding inducers such as phorbol ester and pervanadate, but it is also enhanced by depletion of cellular cholesterol with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD). How such different compounds can induce shedding is presently unknown. We show here that ADAM10 is involved in L1 cleavage, which occurs at the cell surface and in the Golgi apparatus. MCD and pervanadate treatment induced the release of microvesicles containing full-length L1 and the active form of ADAM10. L1 cleavage occurred in isolated vesicles. L1-containing microvesicles could trigger haptotactic cell migration. Only the neural L1 form carrying the RSLE signal for clathrin-dependent endocytosis was recruited and cleaved in vesicles. Phorbol ester treatment activated L1 cleavage predominantly at the cell surface. Our results provide evidence for two pathways of L1 cleavage, based on ADAM10 localization, that can be activated differentially: 1) direct cleavage at the cell surface, and 2) release and cleavage in secretory vesicles most likely derived from the Golgi apparatus. The findings establish a novel role for ADAM10 as a vesicle-based protease.

12706874|t|Yaf2 inhibits Myc biological function.
12706874|a|The proto-oncogenes of the myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) family, including MYC, MYCN and MYCL, encode nuclear proteins that act as transcription factors. The Myc protein is the best studied member of this family and is involved in cell cycle regulation, differentiation and cell death. We have previously demonstrated that the zinc-finger protein Yaf2 interacts with the central region of MycN and enhances MycN dependent transcriptional activation. Here we show that Yaf2 also binds to the Myc protein in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to the activating effect on MycN function, Yaf2 inhibits Myc mediated transactivation and transformation. This differential influence on two members of the Myc family gives insight into a new mechanism to modulate the biological activities of Myc transcription factors.

1281549|t|Expression cloning of a human dual-specificity phosphatase.
1281549|a|Using an expression cloning strategy, we isolated a cDNA encoding a human protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. Bacteria expressing the kinase domain of the keratinocyte growth factor receptor (bek/fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) were infected with a fibroblast cDNA library in a phagemid prokaryotic expression vector and screened with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Among several clones showing decreased anti-phosphotyrosine recognition, one displayed phosphatase activity toward the kinase in vitro. The 4.1-kilobase cDNA encoded a deduced protein of 185 amino acids with limited sequence similarity to the vaccinia virus phosphatase VH1. The purified recombinant protein dephosphorylated several activated growth factor receptors, as well as serine-phosphorylated casein, in vitro. Both serine and tyrosine phosphatase activities were completely abolished by mutagenesis of a single cysteine residue conserved in VH1 and the VH1-related (VHR) human protein. These properties suggest that VHR is capable of regulating intracellular events mediated by both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation.

1317062|t|Identification of the Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt) as a component of the DNA binding form of the Ah receptor.
1317062|a|The Ah (dioxin) receptor binds a number of widely disseminated environmental pollutants, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and mediates their carcinogenic effects. The ligand-bound receptor activates Cyp 1a1 gene transcription through interaction with specific DNA sequences, termed xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs). The Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt) is required for Ah receptor function. Arnt is now shown to be a structural component of the XRE binding form of the Ah receptor. Furthermore, Arnt and the ligand-binding subunit of the receptor were extracted as a complex from the nuclei of cells treated with ligand. Arnt contains a basic helix-loop-helix motif, which may be responsible for interacting with both the XRE and the ligand-binding subunit.

1324173|t|Characterization of SAF-A, a novel nuclear DNA binding protein from HeLa cells with high affinity for nuclear matrix/scaffold attachment DNA elements.
1324173|a|We identified four proteins in nuclear extracts from HeLa cells which specifically bind to a scaffold attachment region (SAR) element from the human genome. Of these four proteins, SAF-A (scaffold attachment factor A), shows the highest affinity for several homologous and heterologous SAR elements from vertebrate cells. SAF-A is an abundant nuclear protein and a constituent of the nuclear matrix and scaffold. The homogeneously purified protein is a novel double stranded DNA binding protein with an apparent molecular weight of 120 kDa. SAF-A binds at multiple sites to the human SAR element; competition studies with synthetic polynucleotides indicate that these sites most probably reside in the multitude of A/T-stretches which are distributed throughout this element. In addition we show by electron microscopy that the protein forms large aggregates and mediates the formation of looped DNA structures.

1329093|t|Expression cloning of a cDNA encoding UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 1-3-GalNAc-R (GlcNAc to GalNAc) beta 1-6GlcNAc transferase by gene transfer into CHO cells expressing polyoma large tumor antigen.
1329093|a|A cDNA encoding UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-R (GlcNAc to GalNAc) beta 1-6GlcNAc transferase (EC 2.4.1.102), which forms critical branches in O-glycans, has been isolated by an expression cloning approach using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Increased activity of this enzyme and the concomitant occurrence of the O-glycan core 2 structure [Gal beta 1-3(GlcNAc beta 1-6)GalNAc] has been observed in a variety of biological processes, such as T-cell activation and immunodeficiency due to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and AIDS. Since CHO cells do not express this enzyme, CHO cell lines were established to stably express polyoma large tumor (T) antigen, which enables transient expression cloning. Because the antibody used was found to detect most efficiently the oligosaccharide products attached to leukosialin, the CHO cells were also stably transfected with leukosialin cDNA. By using this particular CHO cell line, a cDNA that encodes a protein determining the formation of the core 2 structure was isolated from an HL-60 cDNA library. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein with type II membrane topology, as has been found for all other mammalian glycosyltransferases cloned to date. The expression of the presumed catalytic domain as a fusion protein with the IgG binding domain of protein A enabled us to demonstrate unequivocally that the cDNA encodes the core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for the formation of Gal beta 1-3(GlcNAc beta 1-6)GalNAc structures. No activity with this enzyme was detected toward the acceptors for other beta 1-6GlcNAc transferases.

1374453|t|Cloning of a novel tumor necrosis factor-alpha-inducible primary response gene that is differentially expressed in development and capillary tube-like formation in vitro.
1374453|a|TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine that has pleiotropic effects on cells and tissues, mediated in large part by alterations in target tissue gene expression. We have used the technique of differential hybridization to identify several primary response genes induced by TNF in human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells, a cell type that is profoundly activated by cytokine treatment. One of these cDNA, designated B94, detects a rapidly and transiently induced 4-kb transcript in TNF-treated HUVE cells, and this transcript is superinduced in the concomitant presence of cycloheximide. Other proinflammatory stimuli including IL-1 beta and LPS are also able to induce B94 mRNA expression. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrate that TNF induction of B94 transcript occurs primarily at the level of transcriptional activation. Further, B94 is shown to be a single copy gene that is evolutionarily conserved. The gene is localized to the q32 region of chromosome 14, a region that is often rearranged in lymphoid neoplasms. B94 transcript expression is also found to be regulated during mouse development and in an in vitro model of endothelial capillary tube formation. Developmental regulation occurs most prominently in mouse embryonic liver and kidney, and a second smaller form of B94 transcript is detected in the placenta and testes. B94 and other TNF-responsive transcripts are also induced during capillary tube formation suggesting overlap between genes induced by TNF and those induced during angiogenesis. Sequence analysis of the B94 cDNA reveals an open reading frame encoding a 73-kDa polypeptide that has no homology to any known protein. Polyclonal antisera directed against the carboxyl-terminal portion of the B94 protein immunoprecipitates a protein of the predicted molecular mass both from COS cells transfected with a B94 expression vector and from TNF-treated HUVE cells.

1378843|t|Cloning and expression of a cell surface receptor for advanced glycosylation end products of proteins.
1378843|a|Advanced glycosylation end products of proteins (AGEs) are nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins which accumulate in vascular tissue in aging and at an accelerated rate in diabetes. A approximately 35-kDa polypeptide with a unique NH2-terminal sequence has been isolated from bovine lung and found to be present on the surface of endothelial cells where it mediates the binding of AGEs (receptor for advanced glycosylation end product or RAGE). Using an oligonucleotide probe based on the amino-terminal sequence of RAGE, an apparently full-length cDNA of 1.5 kilobases was isolated from a bovine lung cDNA library. This cDNA encoded a 394 amino acid mature protein comprised of the following putative domains: an extracellular domain of 332 amino acids, a single hydrophobic membrane spanning domain of 19 amino acids, and a carboxyl-terminal domain of 43 amino acids. A partial clone encoding the human counterpart of RAGE, isolated from a human lung library, was found to be approximately 90% homologous to the bovine molecule. Based on computer analysis of the amino acid sequence of RAGE and comparison with databases, RAGE is a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules and shares significant homology with MUC 18, NCAM, and the cytoplasmic domain of CD20. Expression of the RAGE cDNA in 293 cells allowed them to bind 125I-AGE-albumin in a saturable and dose-dependent manner (Kd approximately 100 nM), blocked by antibody to RAGE. Western blots of 293 cells transfected with RAGE cDNA probed with anti-RAGE IgG demonstrated expression of immunoreactive protein compared to its absence in mock-transfected cells. These results suggest that RAGE functions as a cell surface receptor for AGEs, which could potentially mediate cellular effects of this class of glycosylated proteins.

1381503|t|Structure of the CD59-encoding gene: further evidence of a relationship to murine lymphocyte antigen Ly-6 protein.
1381503|a|The gene for CD59 [membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL), protectin], a phosphatidylinositol-linked surface glycoprotein that regulates the formation of the polymeric C9 complex of complement and that is deficient on the abnormal hematopoietic cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, consists of four exons spanning 20 kilobases. The untranslated first exon is preceded by a G+C-rich promoter region that lacks a consensus TATA or CAAT motif. The second exon encodes the hydrophobic leader sequence of the protein, and the third exon encodes the amino-terminal portion of the mature protein. The fourth exon encodes the remainder of the mature protein, including the hydrophobic sequence necessary for glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor attachment. The structure of the CD59 gene is very similar to that encoding Ly-6, a murine glycoprotein with which CD59 has some structural similarity. The striking similarity in gene structure is further evidence that the two proteins belong to a superfamily of proteins that may also include the urokinase plasminogen-activator receptor and a squid glycoprotein of unknown function.

1385987|t|Cloning and chromosome mapping of the human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene.
1385987|a|By screening a human genomic library with an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) cDNA probe, we have isolated a 15 kb clone which contains the entire coding region of the gene as expressed in monocytes, and includes 6 kb of 5'-upstream sequence. The gene contains four exons which code for the secreted form of the IL-1ra, however, our clone does not contain the alternative first exon used to generate an intracellular form of the protein as the protein as found in epithelial cells. Analysis of the sequence reveals a consensus TATA box, and three Alu repeats, two of which are in the upstream region and one in intron 3. The sequence also reveals an 86 bp motif tandomly repeated four times within intron 2, and may reflect the polymorphism known to exist in this region of the gene. By in-situ fluorescence hybridization we have shown that the IL-1ra gene is found on the long arm of chromosome 2 and maps to 2q13-14.1. Previous studies have revealed that IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta and both type I and type II forms of the IL-1 receptor all map close to this region of chromosome 2.

14755728|t|Aprataxin, the causative protein for EAOH is a nuclear protein with a potential role as a DNA repair protein.
14755728|a|Early-onset ataxia with ocular motor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (EAOH) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset ataxia, ocular motor apraxia, and hypoalbuminemia. Recently, the causative gene for EAOH, APTX, has been identified. Of the two splicing variants of APTX mRNA, the short and the long forms, long-form APTX mRNA was found to be the major isoform. Aprataxin is mainly located in the nucleus, and, furthermore, the first nuclear localization signal located near the amino terminus of the long-form aprataxin is essential for its nuclear localization. We found, based on the yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, that the long-form but not the short-form aprataxin interacts with XRCC1 (x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1). Interestingly the amino terminus of the long-form aprataxin is homologous with polynucleotidekinase-3'-phosphatase, which has been demonstrated to be involved in base excision repair, a subtype of single-strand DNA break repair, through interaction with XRCC1, DNA polymerase beta, and DNA ligase III. These results strongly support the possibility that aprataxin and XRCC1 constitute a multiprotein complex and are involved in single-strand DNA break repair, and furthermore, that accumulation of unrepaired damaged DNA underlies the pathophysiological mechanisms of EAOH.

15009102|t|Analysis of APAF-1 expression in human cutaneous melanoma progression.
15009102|a|APAF-1 plays a pivotal role in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, binding to cytochrome c and favoring activation of caspase-9. It has been shown that epigenetic silencing of the APAF-1 gene is a common event in several metastatic melanoma cells in vitro. We determined, by Western blot, variation in the level of expression of APAF-1 in several human melanoma cell lines and, by immunohistochemistry, in a group of 106 histological samples including benign and malignant melanocytic lesions. We observed APAF-1 down-regulation or loss of expression in two metastatic melanoma cell lines, compared to primary melanoma cell lines. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant difference in APAF-1 staining between nevi and melanomas. In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between APAF-1 expression level and tumor thickness and between primary melanomas and metastases. We conclude that loss of APAF-1 expression can be considered as an indicator of malignant transformation in melanoma.

1505028|a|A human cDNA was cloned that encodes a DNA-binding protein (SATB1) that is expressed predominantly in thymus and binds selectively to the nuclear matrix/scaffold-associating DNAs (MARs/SARs). Missing nucleoside experiments showed that SATB1 selectively binds in a special AT-rich sequence context where one strand consists of mixed A's, T's, and C's, excluding G's (ATC sequences). When this feature is destroyed by mutation, SATB1 binding is greatly reduced even if the direct contact sequence remains intact. Conjunctional SATB1-binding sequences become stably unpaired in supercoiled DNA. Specific mutations that diminish the unwinding potential greatly reduce SATB1 binding. However, SATB1 does not bind single-stranded DNA. Chemical interference assays show that SATB1 binds along the minor groove with very little contact with the bases. This suggests that SATB1 recognizes the ATC sequence indirectly through the altered sugar-phosphate backbone structure present in the double-stranded DNA.

1567413|t|Cloning and characterization of a human angiotensin II type 1 receptor.
1567413|a|A human liver cDNA library was screened using a rat type 1 angiotensin II receptor cDNA coding sequence as a probe. cDNA clones were isolated which encoded a protein of 359 amino acids that shared 94.4% and 95.3% identify to rat and bovine type 1 angiotensin II receptors, respectively. Ligand binding studies of the cloned receptor expressed in COS cells suggested that it is pharmacologically a type 1 angiotensin II receptor subtype. Electrophysiological studies of the receptor expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that it could functionally couple to a second messenger system leading to the mobilization of intracellular stores of calcium. Southern and Northern blot analyses indicated that the cloned receptor is represented as a single copy in the human genome and is expressed in many tissues of different histogenic origin with the exception of brain, where mRNA transcripts were barely detectable.

1579499|a|A gene encoding a putative human RNA helicase, p54, has been cloned and mapped to the band q23.3 of chromosome 11. The predicted amino acid sequence shares a striking homology (75% identical) with the female germline-specific RNA helicase ME31B gene of Drosophila. Unlike ME31B, however, the new gene expresses an abundant transcript in a large number of adult tissues and its 5' non-coding region was found split in a t(11;14)(q23.3;q32.3) cell line from a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

1628620|t|Mutually exclusive expression of a helix-loop-helix gene and N-myc in human neuroblastomas and in normal development.
1628620|a|We have isolated a novel human gene encoding a helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein by molecularly cloning chromosome 1p36-specific CpG islands. The gene termed heir-1 was localized to the neuroblastoma consensus deletion at 1p36.2-p36.12. Its predicted protein is 95.8% identical to the mouse HLH462 protein and has clear homology to the mouse Id and Drosophila emc proteins. Heir-1 does not encode a basic DNA binding domain as found in basic HLH proteins. The gene is expressed specifically at high abundance in adult lung, kidney and adrenal medulla, but not in adult brain. Despite prominent heir-1 expression in adrenal medulla, which is a prime target for neuroblastomas, 10 out of 12 neuroblastoma-derived cell lines revealed very low levels of heir-1 mRNA. Low heir-1 expression was generally found in tumor cell lines with N-myc overexpression, whereas the two cell lines displaying high heir-1 levels did not overexpress N-myc. Mutually exclusive expression of both genes was also found by in situ hybridization in developing mouse tissues, particularly in the forebrain neuroectoderm. We conclude that heir-1 expression is reduced specifically in the majority of neuroblastomas and suggest an inverse correlation between heir-1 and N-myc expression in neuroblastoma tumors and in embryonic development.

1628625|t|Primary structure and binding activity of the hnRNP U protein: binding RNA through RGG box.
1628625|a|Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are thought to influence the structure of hnRNA and participate in the processing of hnRNA to mRNA. The hnRNP U protein is an abundant nucleoplasmic phosphoprotein that is the largest of the major hnRNP proteins (120 kDa by SDS-PAGE). HnRNP U binds pre-mRNA in vivo and binds both RNA and ssDNA in vitro. Here we describe the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the hnRNP U protein, the determination of its amino acid sequence and the delineation of a region in this protein that confers RNA binding. The predicted amino acid sequence of hnRNP U contains 806 amino acids (88,939 Daltons), and shows no extensive homology to any known proteins. The N-terminus is rich in acidic residues and the C-terminus is glycine-rich. In addition, a glutamine-rich stretch, a putative NTP binding site and a putative nuclear localization signal are present. It could not be defined from the sequence what segment of the protein confers its RNA binding activity. We identified an RNA binding activity within the C-terminal glycine-rich 112 amino acids. This region, designated U protein glycine-rich RNA binding region (U-gly), can by itself bind RNA. Furthermore, fusion of U-gly to a heterologous bacterial protein (maltose binding protein) converts this fusion protein into an RNA binding protein. A 26 amino acid peptide within U-gly is necessary for the RNA binding activity of the U protein. Interestingly, this peptide contains a cluster of RGG repeats with characteristic spacing and this motif is found also in several other RNA binding proteins. We have termed this region the RGG box and propose that it is an RNA binding motif and a predictor of RNA binding activity.

1648233|t|Identification, cloning, and expression of a cytosolic megakaryocyte protein-tyrosine-phosphatase with sequence homology to cytoskeletal protein 4.1.
1648233|a|We have isolated a cDNA encoding a third type of protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. We screened human megakaryoblastic cell line (MEG-01) an umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA libraries to obtain a 3.7-kilobase cDNA designated PTPase MEG. Northern blot analysis of MEG-01 RNA detected a 3.7-kilobase transcript, suggesting that a full-length cDNA has been identified. PTPase MEG cDNA contains an open reading frame of 926 amino acids. The cDNA has a G+C-rich 5' untranslated region of 771 nucleotides that has the potential to form stable stem-loop structures and has two upstream ATG codons. The predicted protein (Mr = 105,910) has no apparent membrane-spanning region and contains a single protein-tyrosine-phosphatase domain (amino acids 659-909) that is 35-40% identical to previously described tyrosine-phosphatase domains. The recombinant phosphatase domain possesses protein-tyrosine-phosphatase activity when expressed in Escherichia coli. The amino-terminal region (amino acids 31-367) is 45% identical to the amino terminus of human erythrocyte protein 4.1, a cytoskeletal protein. The identification of a protein-tyrosine-phosphatase that is related to cytoskeletal proteins implies that cell signaling activities reside not only in transmembrane receptors but in cytoskeletal elements as well.

1648265|t|The receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor.
1648265|a|Although neurotrophic factors were originally isolated on the basis of their ability to support the survival of neurons, these molecules are now thought to influence many aspects of the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Identifying the receptors for these neurotrophic factors should aid in identifying the cells on which these factors act and in understanding their precise mechanisms of action. A " tagged-ligand panning " procedure was used to clone a receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). This receptor is expressed exclusively within the nervous system and skeletal muscle. The CNTF receptor has a structure unrelated to the receptors utilized by the nerve growth factor family of neurotrophic molecules, but instead is most homologous to the receptor for a cytokine, interleukin-6. This similarity suggestes that the CNTF receptor, like the interleukin-6 receptor, requires a second, signal-transducing component. In contrast to all known receptors, the CNTF receptor is anchored to cell membranes by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage.

1651173|t|A direct repeat in the cellular retinol-binding protein type II gene confers differential regulation by RXR and RAR.
1651173|a|The vitamin A derivative retinoic acid exerts its effects on transcription through two distinct classes of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR). We provide evidence that expression of the gene for cellular retinol-binding protein type II (CRBPII), a key protein in the intestinal absorption of vitamin A, is dramatically up-regulated by retinoic acid in the presence of RXR but not RAR. This regulation is conferred through a specific cis element in the CRBPII promoter that contains five nearly perfect tandem repeats of the sequence AGGTCA spaced by a single nucleotide. The discovery of this new RX response element provides a means for distinguishing between the two retinoid receptor systems and suggests that an RXR-mediated pathway exists for modulating vitamin A metabolism.

1655529|t|Cloning, expression and chromosomal localization of a new putative receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase.
1655529|a|We have isolated a mouse cDNA of 5.7 kb, encoding a new member of the family of receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases, termed mRPTP mu. The cDNA predicts a protein of 1432 amino acids (not including signal peptide) with a calculated Mr of 161,636. In addition, we have cloned the human homologue, hRPTP mu, which shows 98.7% amino acid identity to mRPTP mu. The predicted mRPTP mu protein consists of a 722 amino acid extracellular region, containing 13 potential N-glycosylation sites, a single transmembrane domain and a 688 amino acid intracellular part containing 2 tandem repeats homologous to the catalytic domains of other tyrosine phosphatases. The N-terminal extracellular part contains a region of about 170 amino acids with no sequence similarities to known proteins, followed by one Ig-like domain and 4 fibronectin type III-like domains. The intracellular part is unique in that the region between the transmembrane domain and the first catalytic domain is about twice as large as in other receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases. RNA blot analysis reveals a single transcript, that is most abundant in lung and present in much lower amounts in brain and heart. Transfection of the mRPTP mu cDNA into COS cells results in the synthesis of a protein with an apparent Mr of 195,000, as detected in immunoblots using an antipeptide antibody. The human RPTP mu gene is localized on chromosome 18pter-q11, a region with frequent abnormalities implicated in human cancer.

1674604|t|Coexpression of two distinct genes is required to generate secreted bioactive cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor.
1674604|a|Cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor (CLMF) is a disulfide-bonded heterodimeric lymphokine that (i) acts as a growth factor for activated T cells independent of interleukin 2 and (ii) synergizes with suboptimal concentrations of interleukin 2 to induce lymphokine-activated killer cells. We now report the cloning and expression of both human CLMF subunit cDNAs from a lymphoblastoid B-cell line, NC-37. The two subunits represent two distinct and unrelated gene products whose mRNAs are coordinately induced upon activation of NC-37 cells. Coexpression of the two subunit cDNAs in COS cells is necessary for the secretion of biologically active CLMF; COS cells transfected with either subunit cDNA alone do not secrete bioactive CLMF. Recombinant CLMF expressed in mammalian cells displays biologic activities essentially identical to natural CLMF, and its activities can be neutralized by monoclonal antibodies prepared against natural CLMF. Since this heterodimeric protein displays the properties of an interleukin, we propose that CLMF be given the designation interleukin 12.

1693656|t|Structure, expression, and genetic linkage of the mouse BCM1 (OX45 or Blast-1) antigen. Evidence for genetic duplication giving rise to the BCM1 region on mouse chromosome 1 and the CD2/LFA3 region on mouse chromosome 3.
1693656|a|The mouse BCM1 (OX45, Blast-1) antigen has been cDNA cloned and sequenced to provide data supporting the view that BCM1, LFA3, and CD2 constitute a subgroup within the Ig superfamily. Mouse BCM1 is widely expressed on leukocytes and is likely to be anchored to the cell surface by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor, as is the case for rat and human BCM1 antigen. Genetic linkage studies by recombination and pulse field analysis showed the BCM1 locus (Bcm-1) to be on distal mouse chromosome 1 and to be linked within 1,600 kb to the locus for an ATPase alpha chain gene (Atpa-3). A similar relationship was established between the human BCM1 locus (BCM1) and ATP1A2, and other markers on chromosome 1q. Conservation of genomic organization within a segment of human chromosome 1q and mouse chromosome 1 was demonstrated. A similar situation is seen in the region of the CD2 and LFA3 genes between mouse chromosome 3 and human chromosome 1p. Furthermore, the CD2/LFA3 genes are linked within 580 kb to Atpa-1/ATP1A1 genes to provide a parallel situation to the linkage between Bcm-1/BCM1 and Atpa-3/ATP1A2 on chromosomes 1 (mouse) and 1q (human). Taken together, the data suggest duplication of a chromosome region including the precursors of the genes for BCM1, CD2, and LFA3, and the ATPase genes to give rise to the linkage groups now observed. The duplicated regions may have stayed together on chromosome 1 in the human (with the insertion of a centromere), while in the mouse, the genetic regions are proposed to have become dispersed in the formation of chromosomes 1 and 3. CD2 and LFA3 are more dissimilar in sequence than BCM1 and LFA3, and if the precursors of the CD2 and LFA3 loci formed before the proposed chromosome segment duplication, then a gene encoding a recognizer molecule for BCM1 may exist in linkage with Bcm-1/BCM1 on chromosome 1 (mouse) and 1q (human).

1698610|t|Soluble forms of tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNF-Rs). The cDNA for the type I TNF-R, cloned using amino acid sequence data of its soluble form, encodes both the cell surface and a soluble form of the receptor.
1698610|a|Two proteins which specifically bind tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have recently been isolated from human urine in our laboratory. The two proteins cross-react immunologically with two species of cell surface TNF receptors (TNF-R). Antibodies against one of the two TNF binding proteins (TBPI) were found to have effects characteristic of TNF, including stimulating phosphorylation of specific cellular proteins. Oligonucleotide probes designed on the basis of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of TBPI were used to clone the cDNA for the structurally related cell surface type 1 TNF-R. It is notable that although this receptor can signal the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, it appears from its amino acid sequence to be devoid of intrinsic protein kinase activity. The extracellular domain of the receptor is composed of four internal cysteine-rich repeats, homologous to structures repeated four times in the extracellular domains of the nerve growth factor receptor and the B lymphocytes surface antigen CDw40. The amino acid composition and size of the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R closely resemble those of TBPI. The COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of the four cysteine rich repeats within the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R matches the COOH-terminal sequence of TBPI. Amino acid sequences in the extracellular domain also fully match other sequences found in TBPI. On the other hand, amino acid sequences in the soluble form of the type II TNF-R (TBPII), while indicating a marked homology of structure, did not suggest any identity between this protein and the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R. CHO cells transfected with type I TNF-R cDNA produced both cell surface and soluble forms of the receptor. The receptor produced by CHO cells was recognized by several monoclonal antibodies against TBPI, reacting with several distinct epitopes in this molecule. These data suggest that the soluble forms of the TNF-Rs are structurally identical to the extracellular cytokine binding domains of these receptors and are consistent with the notion that the soluble forms are, at least partly, derived from the same transcripts that encode the cell surface receptors.

1730767|t|A novel secretory tumor necrosis factor-inducible protein (TSG-6) is a member of the family of hyaluronate binding proteins, closely related to the adhesion receptor CD44.
1730767|a|TSG-6 cDNA was isolated by differential screening of a lambda cDNA library prepared from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-treated human diploid FS-4 fibroblasts. We show that TSG-6 mRNA was not detectable in untreated cells, but became readily induced by TNF in normal human fibroblast lines and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, TSG-6 mRNA was undetectable in either control or TNF-treated human vascular endothelial cells and a variety of tumor-derived or virus-transformed cell lines. The sequence of full-length TSG-6 cDNA revealed one major open reading frame predicting a polypeptide of 277 amino acids, including a typical cleavable signal peptide. The NH2-terminal half of the predicted TSG-6 protein sequence shows a significant homology with a region implicated in hyaluronate binding, present in cartilage link protein, proteoglycan core proteins, and the adhesion receptor CD44. The most extensive sequence homology exists between the predicted TSG-6 protein and CD44. Western blot analysis with an antiserum raised against a TSG-6 fusion protein detected a 39-kD glycoprotein in the supernatants of TNF-treated FS-4 cells and of cells transfected with TSG-6 cDNA. Binding of the TSG-6 protein to hyaluronate was demonstrated by coprecipitation. Our data indicate that the inflammatory cytokine (TNF or IL-1)-inducible, secretory TSG-6 protein is a novel member of the family of hyaluronate binding proteins, possibly involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during inflammation and tumorigenesis.

1731328|t|Cloning and antisense oligodeoxynucleotide inhibition of a human homolog of cdc2 required in hematopoiesis.
1731328|a|Mechanisms triggering the commitment of pluripotent bone marrow stem cells to differentiated lineages such as mononuclear macrophages or multinucleated megakaryocytes are still unknown, although several lines of evidence suggested correlation between cholinergic signaling and hematopoietic differentiation. We now present cloning of a cDNA coding for CHED (cholinesterase-related cell division controller), a human homolog of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell division cycle 2 (cdc2)-like kinases, universal controllers of the mitotic cell cycle. Library screening, RNA blot hybridization, and direct PCR amplification of cDNA reverse-transcribed from cellular mRNA revealed that CHED mRNA is expressed in multiple tissues, including bone marrow. The CHED protein includes the consensus ATP binding and phosphorylation domains characteristic of kinases, displays 34-42% identically aligned amino acid residues with other cdc2-related kinases, and is considerably longer at its amino and carboxyl termini. An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to interrupt CHED's expression (AS-CHED) significantly reduced the ratio between CHED mRNA and actin mRNA within 1 hr of its addition to cultures, a reduction that persisted for 4 days. AS-CHED treatment selectively inhibited megakaryocyte development in murine bone marrow cultures but did not prevent other hematopoietic pathways, as evidenced by increasing numbers of mononuclear cells. An oligodeoxynucleotide blocking production of the acetylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase, displayed a similar inhibition of megakaryocytopoiesis. In contrast, an oligodeoxynucleotide blocking production of the human 2Hs cdc2 homolog interfered with production of the human 2Hs cdc2 homolog interfered with cellular proliferation without altering the cell-type composition of these cultures. Therefore, these findings strengthen the link between cholinergic signaling and cell division control in hematopoiesis and implicate both CHED and cholinesterases in this differentiation process.

1770008|t|Structural analysis and expression of human desmoglein: a cadherin-like component of the desmosome.
1770008|a|Desmosomes are adhesive cell junctions found in great abundance in tissues that experience mechanical stress. The transmembrane desmosomal glycoproteins have been proposed to play a role in cell adhesion; desmoglein I (DGI) is a major member of this class of desmosomal molecules. However, evidence supporting a role for DGI in cell adhesion or in the plaque is lacking. In order to begin to understand DGI function we have identified human cDNA clones encoding the entire mature polypeptide of 1000 amino acids. Our data suggest that like the bovine DGI molecule human DGI is highly related to the calcium-dependent class of cell adhesion molecules known as cadherins. Four related extracellular domains located in the amino-terminal domain of the molecule contain putative calcium binding sites originally identified in the cadherins. The highest degree of similarity between human N-cadherin and human DGI, and likewise between bovine DGI and human DGI, is greatest in the most amino-terminal extracellular domain. This suggests a conserved functional role for the extracellular domains, perhaps in calcium-mediated cell adhesion. The cytoplasmic portion of the molecule contains a cadherin-like region and, like bovine DGI, a carboxy-terminal tail that is not present in the cadherins, comprising three additional domains. One of these contains a novel repeating motif of 29 +/- 1 residues, first identified in bovine DGI. Each of the highly homologous repeating units is likely to consist of two beta-strands and two turns with special characteristics. Five amino acids that are identical in bovine and human DGI lie in the second of the two predicted beta-strands, and intriguingly contain putative target sites for protein kinase C. On the basis of structural analysis, a model predicting the disposition of human DGI domains in the desmosome is proposed. Northern analysis suggests that unlike bovine epidermis, which expresses a single mRNA of reported size approximately 7.6 kb, human foreskin and cultured keratinocytes display a complex pattern with bands of approximately 7.2, 4.0 and 3.0 kb. Each of these cross-hybridizing mRNAs is coordinately expressed in normal human keratinocytes in response to long-term culture and increased calcium.

2007607|t|Characterization of human loricrin. Structure and function of a new class of epidermal cell envelope proteins.
2007607|a|We have isolated and characterized a full-length cDNA clone encoding human loricrin. Curiously, this protein displays major differences from the recently described mouse loricrin (Mehrel, T., Hohl, D., Nakazawa, H., Rothnagel, J.A., Longley, M.A., Bundman, D., Cheng, C.K., Lichti, U., Bisher, M.E., Steven, A. C., Steinert, P.M., Yuspa, S.H., and Roop, D.R. (1990) Cell 61, 1103-1112). Although both proteins are glycine-serine-cysteine-rich, the sequences have not been conserved. However, analysis of the sequences reveals a common motif of quasi-peptide repeats of an aliphatic or aromatic amino acid residue followed by several glycine and/or serine and cysteine residues. These sequences are interspersed and flanked by short glutamine- or glutamine/lysine-rich peptides. Thus loricrins consist of a family of cell envelope proteins of highly variable sequences that nevertheless retain common structural elements. We show that unlike all other putative protein components of the cell envelope, loricrins are highly insoluble, due at least in part to cross-linking by disulfide bonds. Furthermore, we have isolated four peptides from purified human cell envelopes that contain recognizable loricrin sequences and which are cross-linked by the N epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine isodipeptide bond. The presence of such bonds thus affords an explanation for the extraordinary insolubility of loricrin by cross-linking to the cell envelope and can also explain the low steady-state levels of monomeric loricrin in cytoskeletal extracts of epidermis. This study represents the first report of this isodipeptide cross-link in a protein component of the cornified cell envelope. We propose a model for the structure of loricrin in which (i) the unusual glycine-serine-rich sequences adopt a flexible loop conformation, indexed on the recurrent aliphatic residues; (ii) inter- or intramolecular isodipeptide and disulfide cross-links induce or stabilize folding of loricrin so as to form a more compact rosette-like structure; and (iii) the presence of the flexible glycine-rich loops necessarily will impact a flexible character to the cell envelope and entire epithelium.

2008212|t|Expression cloning of a cocaine- and antidepressant-sensitive human noradrenaline transporter.
2008212|a|At most synapses, chemical signalling is terminated by a rapid reaccumulation of neurotransmitter into presynaptic terminals. Uptake systems for the biogenic amines are the initial site of action for therapeutic antidepressants and drugs such as cocaine and the amphetamines. We have isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a human noradrenaline transporter. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 617 amino acids, with 12-13 highly hydrophobic regions compatible with membrane-spanning domains. Expression of the cDNA clone in transfected HeLa cells indicates that noradrenaline transport activity is sodium-dependent and sensitive to selective noradrenaline transport inhibitors. Transporter RNA is localized to the brainstem and the adrenal gland. The predicted protein sequence demonstrates significant amino-acid identity with the Na+/gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter, thus identifying a new gene family for neurotransmitter transporter proteins. Analysis of its structure and function may lead to structure-based drug design for the treatment of human depression and could help determine whether transporter abnormalities underlie affective disorders.

2115402|t|Localization of low molecular weight GTP binding proteins to exocytic and endocytic compartments.
2115402|a|A set of 11 clones encoding putative GTP binding proteins highly homologous to the yeast YPT1/SEC4 gene products have been isolated from an MDCK cell cDNA library. We localized three of the corresponding proteins in mammalian cells by using affinity-purified antibodies in immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies. One, the MDCK homolog of rab2, is associated with a structure having the characteristics of an intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The second, rab5, is located at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane and on early endosomes, while the third, rab7, is found on late endosomes. These findings provide evidence that members of the YPT1/SEC4 subfamily of GTP binding proteins are localized to specific exocytic and endocytic subcompartments in mammalian cells.

2172835|t|A human homologue of the yeast HDEL receptor.
2172835|a|Retention of resident proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum is achieved in both yeast and animal cells by their continual retrieval from the cis-Golgi, or a pre-Golgi compartment. Sorting of these proteins is dependent on a C-terminal tetrapeptide signal, usually Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL in the single letter code) in animal cells, His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There is evidence that the ERD2 gene encodes the sorting receptor that recognizes HDEL in yeast; its product is an integral membrane protein of relative molecular mass 26,000 (26K) that is not glycosylated. In contrast, Vaux et al. suggest that the mammalian KDEL receptor is a 72K glycoprotein that they detected using an anti-idiotypic antibody approach. If this were so, it would indicate a surprising divergence of the retrieval machinery between yeast and animal cells. We report here that human cells express a protein similar in sequence, size and properties to the ERD2 product, and propose that this protein is the human KDEL receptor.

2208279|t|Primary structure and functional expression of rat and human stem cell factor DNAs.
2208279|a|Partial cDNA and genomic clones of rat stem cell factor (SCF) have been isolated. Using probes based on the rat sequence, partial and full-length cDNA and genomic clones of human SCF have been isolated. Based on the primary structure of the 164 amino acid protein purified from BRL-3A cells, truncated forms of the rat and human proteins have been expressed in E. coli and mammalian cells and have been shown to possess biological activity. SCF is able to augment the proliferation of both myeloid and lymphoid hematopoietic progenitors in bone marrow cultures. SCF exhibits potent synergistic activities in conjunction with colony-stimulating factors, resulting in increased colony numbers and colony size.

2258622|t|Isolation and characterization of cDNA encoding a human nuclear antigen predominantly recognized by autoantibodies from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.
2258622|a|Autoantibodies to a novel nuclear Ag, Sp100, have recently been described that recognize a nuclear protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95 to 100 kDa and a dot-like distribution within cell nuclei. By immunoscreening of a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library derived from HeLa cells with an anti-Sp100 autoimmune serum a 0.7-kb cDNA (Sp26) coding for a fragment of Sp100 was isolated. Expression of this cDNA and use of the recombinant protein in ELISA revealed that the fragment carries major Sp100 autoepitopes and that anti-Sp100 autoantibodies predominantly occur in patients suffering from primary biliary cirrhosis (50/184). The Sp26 cDNA was used as hybridization probe for isolation of longer cDNA from human liver- and placenta-derived lambda gt10 cDNA libraries. Overlapping fragments were assembled to generate a full length cDNA coding for a protein with a molecular mass of 53 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.7. The Sp100 autoantigen expressed in vitro from this cDNA and authenticated by a capture immunoblot assay, comigrated in SDS-PAGE with the authentic HeLa autoantigen of 95 to 100 kDa and thus showed an aberrant electrophoretic mobility. Computer based protein sequence analysis of the Sp100 autoantigen revealed regions of striking sequence similarities to the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of various human and non-human MHC class I Ag and to several transacting transcriptional regulatory proteins.

2258698|t|Expression cloning of a human Fc receptor for IgA.
2258698|a|IgA, the predominant isotype in secretions, mediates the neutralization and removal of environmental antigens from mucosal sites. Although cell surface receptors for the Fc region of IgA (Fc alpha R) have been implicated in a variety of immune effector mechanisms, the molecular features of Fc alpha R remain only marginally characterized. In this report, we describe the isolation of a clone from a myeloid cell line cDNA library that directs the expression of a cell surface molecule with IgA binding specificity. The cDNA encodes a peptide of Mr 30,000 including a putative transmembrane region with features atypical of conventional membrane-anchored proteins. Databank searches indicate that the human myeloid cell Fc alpha R sequence is unique, is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, and is related to Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma RI, II, and III) and IgE (Fc epsilon RI).

2260980|t|Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of cDNA encoding human ferrochelatase.
2260980|a|The cDNA encoding human ferrochelatase [EC 4.99.1.1] was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library in bacteriophage lambda gt11 by screening with a radiolabeled fragment of mouse ferrochelatase cDNA. The cDNA had an open reading frame of 1269 base pairs (bp) encoding a protein of 423 amino acid residues (Mr. 47,833) with alternative putative polyadenylation signals in the 3' non-coding regions and poly (A) tails. Amino acid sequencing showed that the mature protein consists of 369 amino acid residues (Mr. 42,158) with a putative leader sequence of 54 amino acid residues. The human enzyme showed an 88% identity to mouse enzyme and 46% to yeast enzyme. Northern blot analysis showed two mRNAs of about 2500 and 1600 bp for ferrochelatase in K562 and HepG2 cells. As full-length cDNA for human ferrochelatase is now available, molecular lesions related to erythropoietic protoporphyria can be characterized.

2265692|t|Sequence identity between human pancreatic cholesterol esterase and bile salt-stimulated milk lipase.
2265692|a|Three overlapping cDNA clones covering the entire primary sequence of the bile salt stimulated lipase in human milk were isolated from a human breast lambda gt10 cDNA library by screening with the rat pancreatic cholesterol esterase cDNA. Nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA showed that the human milk lipase mRNA encodes a 748-residue protein, including a 23-residue signal peptide. The human milk lipase cDNA is highly homologous to rat pancreatic cholesterol esterase, suggesting that the milk lipase may be identical to the cholesterol esterase in human pancreas. This conclusion was confirmed by isolation and sequencing of the cDNA for human pancreatic cholesterol esterase. Analysis of the sequence for the human cholesterol esterase/milk lipase revealed similarities to other serine esterases in three distinct regions of the protein. These domains may represent the active site triads of these proteins.

2365818|t|Maple syrup urine disease. Complete primary structure of the E1 beta subunit of human branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex deduced from the nucleotide sequence and a gene analysis of patients with this disease.
2365818|a|A defect in the E1 beta subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex is one cause of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). In an attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of MSUD, we isolated and characterized a 1.35 kbp cDNA clone encoding the entire precursor of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH complex from a human placental cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the isolated cDNA clone (lambda hBE1 beta-1) contained a 5'-untranslated sequence of four nucleotides, the translated sequence of 1,176 nucleotides and the 3'-untranslated sequence of 169 nucleotides. Comparison of the amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA insert of the clone with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified mature bovine BCKDH-E1 beta subunit showed that the cDNA insert encodes for a 342-amino acid subunit with a Mr = 37,585. The subunit is synthesized as the precursor with a leader sequence of 50 amino acids and is processed at the NH2 terminus. A search for protein homology revealed that the primary structure of human BCKDH-E1 beta was similar to the bovine BCKDH-E1 beta and to the E1 beta subunit of human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, in all regions. The structures and functions of mammalian alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes are apparently highly conserved. Genomic DNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from normal and five MSUD patients, in whom E1 beta was not detected by immunoblot analysis, gave the same restriction maps on Southern blot analysis. The gene has at least 80 kbp.

2415537|t|Sequence and expression of a human type II mesothelial keratin.
2415537|a|Using mRNA from cultured human mesothelial cells, we constructed bacterial plasmids and lambda phage vectors that contained cDNA sequences specific for the keratins expressed in these cells. A cloned cDNA encoding keratin K7 (55 kD) was identified by positive hybrid selection. Southern Blot analysis indicated that this sequence is represented only once in the human genome, and Northern Blot analysis demonstrated that the gene encoding K7 is expressed in abundance in cultured bronchial and mesothelial cells, but only weakly in cultured epidermal cells and not at all in liver, colon, or exocervical tissue. The predicted amino acid sequence of this keratin has revealed a striking difference between this keratin and the type II keratins expressed in epidermal cells: whereas all of the epidermal type II keratins thus far sequenced have long nonhelical termini rich in glycine and serine, this mesothelial type II keratin has amino and carboxy terminal regions that are unusually short and lack the inexact repeats of glycine and serine residues.

2419904|t|Primary structure of the human melanoma-associated antigen p97 (melanotransferrin) deduced from the mRNA sequence.
2419904|a|p97 is a cell-surface glycoprotein that is present in most human melanomas but only in trace amounts in normal adult tissues. To determine the structure of this tumor-associated antigen and to identify its functional domains, we have purified and cloned p97 mRNA and determined its nucleotide sequence. The mRNA encodes a 738-residue precursor, which contains the previously determined N-terminal amino acid sequence of p97. After removal of a 19-residue signal peptide, the mature p97 molecule comprises extracellular domains of 342 and 352 residues and a C-terminal 25-residue stretch of predominantly uncharged and hydrophobic amino acids, which we believe acts as a membrane anchor. Each extracellular domain contains 14 cysteine residues, which form seven intradomain disulfide bridges, and one or two potential N-glycosylation sites. Protease digestion studies show that the three major antigenic determinants of p97 are present on the N-terminal domain. The domains are strikingly homologous to each other (46% amino acid sequence homology) and to the corresponding domains of human serum transferrin (39% homology). Conservation of disulfide bridges and of amino acids thought to compose the iron binding pockets suggests that p97 is also related to transferrin in tertiary structure and function. We propose that p97 be renamed melanotransferrin to denote its original identification in melanoma cells and its evolutionary relationship to serotransferrin and lactotransferrin, the other members of the transferrin superfamily.

2558868|t|Isolation and sequence of a cDNA clone for human calcineurin B, the Ca2+-binding subunit of the Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase.
2558868|a|We have identified and cloned human cDNA for the Ca2+-binding subunit of calcineurin, the brain isozyme of the Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase. The 2.5-kb cDNA has an open reading frame of 510 bp, a leader sequence of at least 500 bp, and a 1,277-bp 3'-noncoding sequence. The deduced sequence of the human protein differs from bovine brain calcineurin B by an additional valine at the carboxyl terminus and substitution of Met-11 and Ser-153 by cysteine. A partial clone of the mouse protein corresponding to amino acids 75-150 was also isolated. This portion of the human and mouse protein sequence is identical, with the DNA sequences showing 94% identity. The respective mRNAs in human and mouse are also of similar size. As was observed with protein levels, mRNA abundance in brain is 20-60 times that found in other tissues with the exception of HeLa cells which, like brain, contain abundant calcineurin B mRNA.

2674117|t|Human liver serine dehydratase. cDNA cloning and sequence homology with hydroxyamino acid dehydratases from other sources.
2674117|a|Rat liver serine dehydratase cDNA was used to screen a human liver cDNA library in lambda gt11. One positive clone occurred in every 5,000 clones. Fifteen positive clones were plaque purified. The largest cDNA obtained contained an open reading frame of 987 base pairs, and 5' and 3' noncoding regions of 89 and 317 base pairs, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence, with a calculated Mr of 34,615, was similar to that of rat liver serine dehydratase except for the absence of a segment consisting of 36 amino acid residues. In vitro transcription/translation with the cDNA resulted in the formation of a polypeptide with an Mr of approximately 35,000, which cross-reacted with the anti-rat serine dehydratase antibody. These results suggest that the human serine dehydratase is structurally cognate with the rat enzyme. Moreover, portions of the sequence postulated to be essential for activity in microbial threonine dehydratases are found in the mammalian serine dehydratases, suggesting that hydroxyamino and dehydratases may have originated from a common ancestor.

2674130|t|rac, a novel ras-related family of proteins that are botulinum toxin substrates.
2674130|a|A new family of ras-related proteins, designated rac (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate) has been identified. rac1 and rac2 cDNA clones were isolated from a differentiated HL-60 library and encode proteins that are 92% homologous and share 58% and 26-30% amino acid homology with human rhos and ras, respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis predicts both rac1 and rac2 proteins to contain 192 amino acids with molecular masses of 21,450 and 21,429 daltons, respectively. rac1 and rac2 possess four of the five conserved functional domains in ras associated with binding and hydrolysis of guanine nucleotides. They also contain the COOH-terminal consensus sequence Cys-X-X-X-COOH which localizes ras to the inner plasma membrane and the residues Gly12 and Ala59, at which sites mutations elicit transforming potential to ras. The rac transcripts, particularly rac2, display relative myeloid tissue selectivity. Both rac1 transcripts (2.4 and 1.1 kilobases (kb] increase when HL-60 cells differentiate to neutrophil-like morphology. In contrast, differentiation of U937 cells to monocyte-like morphology causes no change in the 2.4-kb mRNA and a decrease in the 1.1-kb mRNA species. rac2 mRNA (1.45 kb) increases 7-9-fold and 3-fold upon differentiation of HL-60 and U937 cells, respectively. Neither rac mRNAs are present in a Jurkat T cell line, and unlike rac1, rac2 mRNA is absent in human brain and liver tissue. Transfection experiments permitted the demonstration that rac1 and rac2 are substrates for ADP-ribosylation by the C3 component of botulinum toxin. The data suggest that racs are plasma membrane-associated GTP-binding proteins which could regulate secretory processes, particularly in myeloid cells.

2674141|t|Human gastric cathepsin E. Predicted sequence, localization to chromosome 1, and sequence homology with other aspartic proteinases.
2674141|a|The predicted sequence of human gastric cathepsin E (CTSE) was determined by analysis of cDNA clones isolated from a library constructed with poly(A+) RNA from a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. The CTSE cDNA clones were identified using a set of complementary 18-base oligonucleotide probes specific for a 6-residue sequence surrounding the first active site of all previously characterized human aspartic proteinases. Sequence analysis of CTSE cDNA clones revealed a 1188-base pair open reading frame that exhibited 59% sequence identity with human pepsinogen A. The predicted CTSE amino acid sequence includes a 379-residue proenzyme (Mr = 40,883) and a 17-residue signal peptide. The predicted CTSE amino acid composition was consistent with that of purified material from gastric mucosa and gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines. Additional evidence for the identification of the CTSE cDNA clones was obtained by analysis of poly(A+) RNA isolated from CTSE-producing and -nonproducing gastric adenocarcinoma cell subclones. Three RNA transcripts (3.6, 2.6, and 2.1 kilobases) were identified in poly(A+) RNA isolated from a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line that produced CTSE that were absent from nonproducing subclones. CTSE contains 7 cysteine residues, of which 6 were localized by comparative maximal alignment analysis with pepsinogen A to conserved residues that form intrachain disulfide bonds. The seventh cysteine residue of CTSE is located within the activation peptide region of the proenzyme. We suspect that this residue forms an interchain disulfide bond and thereby determines the dimerization of CTSE proenzyme molecules that is observed under native conditions. The CTSE gene was localized to human chromosome 1 by concurrent cytogenetic and cDNA probe analyses of a panel of human x mouse somatic cell hybrids.

2730637|t|Homology between a region of the human retinoblastoma gene and L1 family repetitive sequences.
2730637|a|Five clones that hybridized weakly with the human retinoblastoma (Rb) gene were obtained by screening a human genomic library in a non-stringent condition. The DNAs of two of these clones were partially sequenced and found to contain a region with considerable homology to part of the Rb gene. These two clones were found to contain L1 family repeating sequences. This finding is discussed in relation with possible functions of the L1 family. As the L1 family is transposable, the Rb gene may be inactivated by recombination at this homologous region. Another possibility related with the DNA binding properties of Rb and L1 family proteins is also discussed.

2739739|t|COUP transcription factor is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily.
2739739|a|The COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) transcription factor (COUP-TF) exists in a number of different tissues and is essential for expression of the chicken ovalbumin gene. It binds to the ovalbumin promoter and, in conjunction with a second protein (S300-II), stimulates initiation of transcription in vitro. COUP-TF also binds specifically to the rat insulin promoter element, although the two binding sites share little sequence similarity. Here we report the isolation of a human complementary DNA clone encoding COUP-TF. Comparison of the amino-acid sequence of COUP-TF with known sequences reveals that it is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone/vitamin receptor superfamily. Consequently, it is the first member of this family that has been shown to function in a cell-free transcription system. We conclude that this superfamily of gene regulators contains proteins which bind and activate distal promoter elements of eukaryotic genes.

2785715|t|Interleukin-2 receptor beta chain gene: generation of three receptor forms by cloned human alpha and beta chain cDNA's.
2785715|a|Interleukin-2 (IL-2) binds to two distinct receptor molecules, the IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha, p55) chain and the newly identified IL-2 receptor beta (IL-2R beta, p70-75) chain. The cDNA encoding the human IL-2R beta chain has now been isolated. The overall primary structure of the IL-2R beta chain shows no apparent homology to other known receptors. Unlike the IL-2R alpha chain, the IL-2R beta chain has a large cytoplasmic region in which a functional domain (or domains) mediating an intracellular signal transduction pathway (or pathways) may be embodied. The cDNA-encoded beta chain binds and internalizes IL-2 when expressed on T lymphoid cells but not fibroblast cells. Furthermore, the cDNA gives rise to the generation of high-affinity IL-2 receptor when co-expressed with the IL-2R alpha chain cDNA.

2786251|t|Autoimmune target in Heymann nephritis is a glycoprotein with homology to the LDL receptor.
2786251|a|The pathogenesis of Heymann nephritis, a rat model of human membranous glomerulonephritis, depends on the interaction of autoantibodies with a renal glycoprotein (GP330) on glomerular podocytes. Partial complementary DNAs coding for GP330 were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence from 4.3 kilobases of complementary DNA contains the sequences identical to two peptides derived from the isolated glycoprotein. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein contains regions with homology to the human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, an indication that GP330 and the LDL receptor may be members of the same gene family. Autoantibodies from the kidneys of rats with Heymann nephritis reacted with a nonglycosylated segment of GP330 that contains cysteine-rich 40-amino acid repeats, which are also features of the LDL receptor. GP330 is also similar in some regions to the mouse epidermal growth factor precursor.

2885805|a|We have isolated a full length cDNA (cDNA) coding for the human poly(A) binding protein. The cDNA derived 73 kd basic translation product has the same Mr, isoelectric point and peptidic map as the poly(A) binding protein. DNA sequence analysis reveals a 70,244 dalton protein. The N terminal part, highly homologous to the yeast poly(A) binding protein, is sufficient for poly(A) binding activity. This domain consists of a four-fold repeated unit of approximately 80 amino acids present in other nucleic acid binding proteins. In the C terminal part there is, as in the yeast protein, a sequence of approximately 150 amino acids, rich in proline, alanine and glutamine which together account for 48% of the residues. A 2,9 kb mRNA corresponding to this cDNA has been detected in several vertebrate cell types and in Drosophila melanogaster at every developmental stage including oogenesis.

2885844|t|Two human homeobox genes, c1 and c8: structure analysis and expression in embryonic development.
2885844|a|Two human cDNA clones (HHO.c1.95 and HHO.c8.5111) containing a homeobox region have been characterized, and the respective genomic regions have been partially analyzed. Expression of the corresponding genes, termed c1 and c8, was evaluated in different organs and body parts during human embryonic/fetal development. HHO.c1.95 apparently encodes a 217-amino acid protein containing a class I homeodomain that shares 60 out of 61 amino acid residues with the Antennapedia homeodomain of Drosophila melanogaster. HHO.c8.5111 encodes a 153-amino acid protein containing a homeodomain identical to that of the frog AC1 gene. Clones HHO.c1 and HHO.c8 detect by blot-hydridization one and two specific polyadenylylated transcripts, respectively. These are differentially expressed in spinal cord, backbone rudiments, limb buds (or limbs), heart, and skin of human embryos and early fetuses in the 5- to 9-week postfertilization period, thus suggesting that the c1 and c8 genes play a key role in a variety of developmental processes. Together, the results of the embryonic/fetal expression of c1 and c8 and those of two previously analyzed genes (c10 and c13) indicate a coherent pattern of expression of these genes in early human ontogeny.

3014652|t|Studies of the human c-myb gene and its product in human acute leukemias.
3014652|a|The myb gene is the transforming oncogene of the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV); its normal cellular homolog, c-myb, is conserved across a broad span of evolution. In humans, c-myb is expressed in malignant hematopoietic cell lines and in primary hematopoietic tumors. Partial complementary DNA clones were generated from blast cells of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. The sequences of the clones were compared to the c-myb of other species, as well as the v-myb of AMV. In addition, the carboxyl terminal region of human c-myb was placed in an expression vector to obtain protein for the generation of antiserum, which was used to identify the human c-myb gene product. Like v-myb, this protein was found within the nucleus of leukemic cells where it was associated with the nuclear matrix. These studies provide further evidence that c-myb might be involved in human leukemia.

3034271|t|Human creatine kinase: isolation and sequence analysis of cDNA clones for the B subunit, development of subunit specific probes and determination of gene copy number.
3034271|a|cDNA clones for human B creatine kinase were isolated from human brain and placenta libraries. The entire coding and 3' untranslated regions, as well as 23 bp of the 5' untranslated region were sequenced. Complete sequence identity was found among the clones, with the exception of an area of heterogeneity among the 3' untranslated region of the brain and placenta clones. A 77.7% nucleotide sequence identity was found between the coding region of human B creatine kinase and our previously reported human M creatine kinase. In contrast, no homology was found in the 3' untranslated regions. Probes were constructed from the nonconserved 3' untranslated regions of human M and B creatine kinase and were shown to be highly specific. Southern transfers of total genomic DNA derived from human placenta and digested to completion with several restriction enzymes were probed with the MCK and BCK specific probes producing single hybridization bands. These results suggest that creatine kinase M and B are single copy genes in the human genome.

3146346|t|Involvement of DNA polymerase delta in DNA repair synthesis in human fibroblasts at late times after ultraviolet irradiation.
3146346|a|DNA repair synthesis following UV irradiation of confluent human fibroblasts has a biphasic time course with an early phase of rapid nucleotide incorporation and a late phase of much slower nucleotide incorporation. The biphasic nature of this curve suggests that two distinct DNA repair systems may be operative. Previous studies have specifically implicated DNA polymerase delta as the enzyme involved in DNA repair synthesis occurring immediately after UV damage. In this paper, we describe studies of DNA polymerase involvement in DNA repair synthesis in confluent human fibroblasts at late times after UV irradiation. Late UV-induced DNA repair synthesis in both intact and permeable cells was found to be inhibited by aphidicolin, indicating the involvement of one of the aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerases, alpha or delta. In permeable cells, the process was further analyzed by using the nucleotide analogue (butylphenyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate, which inhibits DNA polymerase alpha several hundred times more strongly than it inhibits DNA polymerase delta. The (butylphenyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate inhibition curve for late UV-induced repair synthesis was very similar to that for polymerase delta. It appears that repair synthesis at late times after UV irradiation, like repair synthesis at early times, is mediated by DNA polymerase delta.

The predicted primary structure of the enzyme exhibits a sequence similarity of 61% and 45% with human 5-lipoxygenase and the soybean lipoxygenase isoenzyme I, respectively. When all three lipoxygenases are aligned, there are two distinct regions of significant sequence identity including a cluster of five histidine residues conserved in all three lipoxygenases. Because histidines can serve as ligands for the enzymatically active iron, this region may be critical to enzymatic function. These results provide a basis for exploring functional domains of lipoxygenases.

3203386|a|The serum response element (SRE) is a sequence required for transient transcriptional activation of genes in response to growth factors. We have isolated cDNA clones encoding serum response factor (SRF), a ubiquitous nuclear protein that binds to the SRE. The SRF gene is highly conserved through evolution, and in cultured cells its transcription is itself transiently increased following serum stimulation. A cDNA clone of SRF expressed in vitro generates protein that forms complexes indistinguishable from those formed with HeLa cell SRF, as judged by DNA binding specificity and the ability to promote SRE-dependent in vitro transcription. SRF binds DNA as a dimer, and the DNA binding/dimerization domain of the protein exhibits striking homology to two yeast regulatory proteins.

We report here the molecular cloning of 3 cDNA encoding different members of the PS beta G family. Two clones (C, D) correspond to a single transcript undergoing differential splicing. The third one (E) originates from a different gene. All three clones have identical (C, D) or similar (E) coding sequences except for the last residues at their carboxyl end. They contain 93 residue motifs related to the ancestral Ig-like domain which makes them new members of this gene superfamily. A striking sequence similarity (50 to 60%) is observed between PS beta G and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related proteins. The evolutionary relationship between CEA and PS beta G points to a possible common function in the control of cell invasion and/or metastasis.

3446585|t|Isolation of cDNA clones coding for rat isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase and assignment of the gene to human chromosome 15.
3446585|a|Rat liver mRNA encoding the cytoplasmic precursor of mitochondrial isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase was highly enriched by polysome immunopurification using a polyclonal monospecific antibody. The purified mRNA was used to prepare a plasmid cDNA library which was screened with two oligonucleotide mixtures encoding two peptides in the amino-terminal portion of mature rat isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase. Thirty-one overlapping cDNA clones, spanning a region of 2.1 kbp, were isolated and characterized. The cDNA sequence of a 5'-end clone, rIVD-13 (155 bp), predicts a mitochondrial leader peptide of 30 amino acid residues and the first 18 amino acids of the mature protein. These consecutive 18 residues completely matched the amino-terminal peptide determined by automated Edman degradation of the rat enzyme. The leader peptide contains six arginines, has no acidic residues, and is particularly rich in leucine, alanine, and proline residues. Southern blot analysis of DNAs from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids with an isolated rat cDNA (2 kbp) assigned the isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase gene to the long arm of chromosome 15, region q14----qter. The chromosomal assignment was confirmed and further refined to bands q14----q15 by in situ hybridization of the probe to human metaphase cells. This location differs from that of the gene for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a closely related enzyme, which has been previously assigned to chromosome 1.

3758678|a|A cDNA encoding human delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D; EC 4.2.1.24), the second enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, was isolated from a human liver cDNA expression library. Of the original 17 clones selected with anti-ALA-D antibody, only four expressed anti-ALA-D epitopes as assessed by rescreening with antibody preabsorbed with purified antigen. Subsequent screening of the antibody-positive clones with mixed oligodeoxynucleotide (oligo) probes, synthesized to correspond to human N-terminal and bovine active-site peptide sequences, identified three clones which hybridized only with the oligo probes for the bovine amino acid (aa) sequences. Restriction endonucleases analysis revealed that these three clones contained the same 800-bp cDNA insert. This insert was recloned into bacteriophage M13mp18 and mp19 and sequenced by primer extension. The aa sequence predicted from the partial nucleotide sequence was found to be essentially colinear with the sequences of four bovine ALA-D peptides, totaling 35 non-overlapping aa residues.

3858849|t|6-Phosphogluconolactonase deficiency, a hereditary erythrocyte enzyme deficiency: possible interaction with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
3858849|a|Partial deficiency of 6-phosphogluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.31) of the erythrocytes was discovered as an autosomal dominant disorder. Hemolytic anemia occurred in an individual who had inherited both the gene for 6-phosphogluconolactonase deficiency and that for deficiency of a nonhemolytic variant of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49). It is proposed that the interaction of this hereditary erythrocyte abnormality with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may explain hemolysis in some other patients who have inherited polymorphic variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

6262916|t|Human muscle phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency: newly discovered metabolic myopathy.
6262916|a|Muscle phosphoglycerate mutase activity was decreased (5.7 percent of the lowest control value) in a 52-year-old man with intolerance for strenuous exercise and recurrent pigmenturia since adolescence. All of the other enzymes of glycolysis had normal activities, and glycogen concentration was normal. Electrophoretic, heat lability, and mercury inhibition studies showed that the small residual activity in the patient's muscle was represented by the brain (BB) isoenzyme of phosphoglycerate mutase, suggesting a genetic defect of the M subunit which predominates in normal muscle. The prevalence of the BB isoenzyme in other tissues, including muscle culture, may explain why symptoms were confined to muscle.

6431896|t|Linkage of the LW blood group locus with the complement C3 and Lutheran blood group loci.
6431896|a|Segregation data on LW in families of informative males show that the LW (Landsteiner-Wiener) blood group locus is closely linked to the complement C3 locus and to the locus for the Lutheran blood group. This finding also confirms the presence of a larger linkage group on chromosome 19, including now the loci for apoE, Le, C3, LW, Lu, Se, H, PEPD, myotonic dystrophy (DM), neurofibromatosis (NF) and familial hypercholesterolemia (FHC). Linkage of LW with the Lewis blood group locus could not be definitely established by the present family data, but small positive scores between LW and Le suggest that the Le locus is situated outside the C3-LW region.

6688123|t|Human beta-nerve growth factor gene sequence highly homologous to that of mouse.
6688123|a|Nerve growth factor (NGF) is thought to have a profound effect on the development and maintenance of sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurones (see refs 1-3 for review). NGF activity isolated from the male mouse submaxillary gland (MSG) consists of three types of subunits, alpha, beta and gamma, which specifically interact to form a 7S, approximately 130,000-molecular weight (Mr) complex. The 7S complex contains two identical 118-amino acid beta-chains, which are solely responsible for the nerve growth-stimulating activity of NGF. While NGF is found in almost all vertebrates, most research has focused on murine NGF, as the mouse male submaxillary gland contains higher levels of this polypeptide than other tissues. Even so, beta-NGF comprises only approximately 0.1% of the protein in this small gland, which has made the study of this polypeptide difficult. The amino acid sequence of the mouse NGF beta-chain has been determined and some information has been obtained regarding the size of a mouse precursor molecule, pro-beta-NGF, but little was known about the structure and relatedness of beta-NGF from other vertebrates. Here we describe the isolation of mouse beta-NGF complementary DNA (cDNA) and present its nucleotide sequence, which predicts a prepro-beta-NGF molecule of Mr 27,000 (27K) and a pro-beta-NGF molecule of Mr 25K. We have used the mouse beta-NGF cDNA clone to isolate the human beta-NGF gene, the coding regions of which are highly homologous to the mouse prepro-beta-NGF nucleotide and amino acid sequences.

7479749|t|Mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the rod cGMP-gated channel in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.
7479749|a|Mutations in the genes encoding two proteins of the retinal rod phototransduction cascade, opsin and the beta subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase, cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in some families. Here we report defects in a third member of this biochemical pathway in still other patients with this disease. We screened 94 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant RP and 173 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive RP for mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel. Five mutant sequences cosegregated with disease among four unrelated families with autosomal recessive RP. Two of these were nonsense mutations early in the reading frame (Glu76End and Lys139End) and one was a deletion encompassing most if not all of the transcriptional unit; these three alleles would not be expected to encode a functional channel. The remaining two mutations were a missense mutation (Ser316Phe) and a frameshift [Arg654(1-bp del)] mutation truncating the last 32 aa in the C terminus. The latter two mutations were expressed in vitro and found to encode proteins that were predominantly retained inside the cell instead of being targeted to the plasma membrane. We conclude that the absence or paucity of functional cGMP-gated cation channels in the plasma membrane is deleterious to rod photoreceptors and is an uncommon cause of RP.

7479798|t|Cloning and characterization of a cellular apoptosis susceptibility gene, the human homologue to the yeast chromosome segregation gene CSE1.
7479798|a|We recently isolated human cDNA fragments that render MCF-7 breast cancer cells resistant to cell death caused by Pseudomonas exotoxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin-derived immunotoxins, diphtheria toxin, and tumor necrosis factor. We report here that one of these fragments is an antisense fragment of a gene homologous to the essential yeast chromosome segregation gene CSE1. Cloning and analysis of the full-length cDNA of the human CSE1 homologue, which we name CAS for cellular apoptosis susceptibility gene, reveals a protein coding region with similar length (971 amino acids for CAS, 960 amino acids for CSE1) and 59% overall protein homology to the yeast CSE1 protein. The conservation of this gene indicates it has an important function in human cells consistent with the essential role of CSE1 in yeast. CAS is highly expressed in human tumor cell lines and in human testis and fetal liver, tissues that contain actively dividing cells. Furthermore, CAS expression increases when resting human fibroblasts are induced to proliferate and decreases when they are growth-arrested. Thus, CAS appears to play an important role in both toxin and tumor necrosis factor-mediated cell death, as well as in cell proliferation.

7490069|t|Identification of four novel human genes amplified and overexpressed in breast carcinoma and localized to the q11-q21.3 region of chromosome 17.
7490069|a|We have performed differential screening of a human metastatic lymph lymph node cDNA library to identify genes possibly involved during breast cancer progression. We have identified four novel genes overexpressed in malignant tiddues. They were all located on the long arm of chromosome 17, in loci located between q11 and q21.3, a region known to contain the c-erbB-2 oncogene and the BRCA1 breast carcinomas, and overexpression of three of them was dependent on gene amplification in breast cancer cell lines. These findings further support the concept that human chromosome 17 specifically carries genes possibly involved in breast cancer progression.

7490079|t|Molecular cloning of the human homolog of a striatum-enriched phosphatase (STEP) gene and chromosomal mapping of the human and murine loci.
7490079|a|A gene for a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) was isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library by PCR amplification. Sequence analysis revealed that the PTPase has a single phosphatase catalytic domain located at the C-terminus that includes the highly conserved amino acid domain [I/V]HCXAGXXR[S/T]GX[F/Y] found in all tyrosine phosphatases. Two proline-rich regions located at the N-terminus may contain putative Src homology domain 3 (SH3) binding motifs. Comparison of the PTPase with a previously cloned striatum enriched phosphatase (STEP) from rat and from mouse exhibited a high degree of identity (approximately 85-90%) at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels, indicating that the human PTPase is the homolog of the rat and murine STEP gene. By using a combination of somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have mapped the human STEP locus to chromosome 11p15.2-p15.1 and the murine STEP gene to chromosome 7B3-B5. These are two regions of known conserved synteny, providing further evidence that the human STEP is a true homolog of the murine STEP gene. Candidate disease genes in the vicinity include Usher syndrome type 1C in human and a mouse mutant locus, twister (twt).

7490082|t|Cloning of the cDNA for the human ATP synthase OSCP subunit (ATP5O) by exon trapping and mapping to chromosome 21q22.1-q22.2.
7490082|a|Exon trapping was used to clone portions of potential genes from human chromosome 21. One trapped sequence showed striking homology with the bovine and rat ATP synthase OSCP (oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein) subunit. We subsequently cloned the full-length human ATP synthase OSCP cDNA (GDB/HGMW approved name ATP50) from infant brain and muscle libraries and determined its nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence (EMBL/GenBank Accession No. X83218). The encoded polypeptide contains 213 amino acids, with more than 80% identity to bovine and murine ATPase OSCP subunits and over 35% identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and sweet potato sequences. The human ATP5O gene is located at 21q22.1-q22.2, just proximal to D21S17, in YACs 860G11 and 838C7 of the Chumakov et al. (Nature 359:380, 1992) YAC contig. The gene is expressed in all human tissues examined, most strongly in muscle and heart. This ATP5O subunit is a key structural component of the stalk of the mitochondrial respiratory chain F1F0-ATP synthase and as such may contribute in a gene dosage-dependent manner to the phenotype of Down syndrome (trisomy 21).

7490083|t|Genomic organization of the human gene (CA5) and pseudogene for mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase V and their localization to chromosomes 16q and 16p.
7490083|a|Carbonic anhydrase V (CA V) is expressed in mitochondrial matrix in liver and several other tissues. It is of interest for its putative roles in providing bicarbonate to carbamoyl phosphate synthetase for ureagenesis and to pyruvate carboxylase for gluconeogenesis and its possible importance in explaining certain inherited metabolic disorders with hyperammonemia and hypoglycemia. Following the recent characterization of the cDNA for human CA V, we report the isolation of the human gene from two lambda genomic libraries and its characterization. The CA V gene (CA5) is approximately 50 kb long and contains 7 exons and 6 introns. The exon-intron boundaries are found in positions identical to those determined for the previously described CA II, CA III, and CA VII genes. Like the CA VII gene, CA5 does not contain typical TATA and CAAT promoter elements in the 5' flanking region but does contain a TTTAA sequence 147 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. CA5 also contains a 12-bp GT-rich segment beginning 13 bp downstream of the polyadenylation signal in the 3' untranslated region of exon 7. FISH analysis allowed CA5 to be assigned to chromosome 16q24.3. An unprocessed pseudogene containing sequence homologous to exons 3-7 and introns 3-6 was also isolated and was assigned by FISH analysis to chromosome 16p11.2-p12.

7490091|t|Generation of a transcription map at the HSD17B locus centromeric to BRCA1 at 17q21.
7490091|a|A detailed transcription map of the 320-kb region containing the HSD17B locus on chromosome 17 was generated. Thirty unique cDNA fragments, retrieved following the hybridization of immobilized YACs to primary pools of cDNAs prepared from RNA of mammary gland, ovary, placenta, and the Caco-2 cell line, were aligned into 10 transcription units by physical mapping and hybridization to RNAs of a series of tissues. The cDNAs were then further characterized by sequencing and used to screen mammary gland cDNA libraries. Fragments corresponding to the broadly expressed gamma-tubulin and Ki antigen genes were identified. A full-length cDNA clone encoding a 117-amino-acid protein homologous to the rat ribosomal protein L34 was isolated. Portions of genes with restricted patterns of expression were also obtained, including the previously characterized HSD17B1. One new gene, for which a full-length cDNA was isolated, was found to have an interesting tissue-specific pattern of expression with abundant mRNA in both the colon and the testis and in the mammary carcinoma cell line BT-474. This contrasted with the barely detectable level observed in several tissues including normal mammary gland. Of the five additional transcription units identified, one showed no similarity, two showed identity to human expressed sequences, and two displayed similarity to genes of animal species by amino acid alignment. These latter cDNA clones include potential homologues of a rat nuclear tyrosine phosphatase and of a factor of Drosophila that is known to be involved in the negative regulation of transcription of segment identity genes.

7499366|t|A novel K+ channel beta-subunit (hKv beta 1.3) is produced via alternative mRNA splicing.
7499366|a|Voltage-gated K+ channels can form multimeric complexes with accessory beta-subunits. We report here a novel K+ channel beta-subunit cloned from human heart, hKv beta 1.3, that has 74-83% overall identity with previously cloned beta-subunits. Comparison of hKv beta 1.3 with the previously cloned hKv beta 3 and rKv beta 1 proteins indicates that the carboxyl-terminal 328 amino acids are identical, while unique variable length amino termini exist. Analysis of human beta-subunit cDNA and genomic nucleotide sequences confirm that these three beta-subunits are alternatively spliced from a common beta-subunit gene. Co-expression of hKv beta 1.3 in Xenopus oocytes with the delayed rectifier hKv1.5 indicated that hKv beta 1.3 has unique functional effects. This novel beta-subunit induced a time-dependent inactivation during membrane voltage steps to positive potentials, induced a 13-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve, and slowed deactivation (tau = 13 +/- 0.5 ms versus 35 +/- 1.7 ms at -40 mV). Most notably, hKv beta 1.3 converted the Kv1.5 outwardly rectifying current voltage relationship to one showing strong inward rectification. These data suggest that Kv channel current diversity may arise from association with alternatively spliced Kv beta-subunits. A simplified nomenclature for the K+ channel beta-subunit subfamilies is suggested.

7506095|t|De novo mutation of the myelin P0 gene in Dejerine-Sottas disease (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type III).
7506095|a|We have investigated the myelin P0 gene on chromosome 1 as a candidate gene in two sporadic cases with Dejerine-Sottas disease or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) type III. We found different mutations, a cysteine substitution for serine 63 in the extracellular domain and an arginine substitution for glycine 167 in the transmembrane domain. The patients were genetically heterozygous for the normal allele and the mutant allele, which was absent in their parents and in one hundred unrelated, healthy controls. The results strongly suggest that a de novo dominant mutation of the P0 gene is responsible for at least some sporadic cases of Dejerine-Sottas disease.

7509806|t|Human serum biotinidase. cDNA cloning, sequence, and characterization.
7509806|a|Biotinidase (EC 3.5.1.12) catalyzes the hydrolysis of biocytin, the product of biotin-dependent carboxylase degradation, to biotin and lysine. Biotinidase deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder of biotin recycling that is characterized by neurological and cutaneous abnormalities, and can be successfully treated with biotin supplementation. Sequences of tryptic peptides of the purified human serum enzyme were used to design oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification from human hepatic total RNA to generate putative biotinidase cDNA fragments. Sequence analysis of a cDNA isolated from a human liver library by plaque hybridization with the largest cDNA probe revealed an open reading frame of 1629 bases encoding a protein of 543 amino acid residues, including 41 amino acids of a potential signal peptide. Comparison of the open reading frame with the known biotinidase tryptic peptides and recognition of the expressed protein encoded by this cDNA by monoclonal antibodies prepared against purified biotinidase demonstrated the identity of this cDNA. Southern analyses suggested that biotinidase is a single copy gene and revealed that human cDNA probes hybridized to genomic DNA from mammals, but not from chicken or yeast. Northern analysis indicated the presence of biotinidase mRNA in human heart, brain, placenta, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas.

7512734|t|C3G, a guanine nucleotide-releasing protein expressed ubiquitously, binds to the Src homology 3 domains of CRK and GRB2/ASH proteins.
7512734|a|CRK protein, together with GRB2/ASH and Nck proteins, belongs to the adaptor-type Src homology (SH)2-containing molecules, which transduce signals from tyrosine kinases. Here another guanine nucleotide-releasing protein (GNRP), C3G, has been identified as a CRK SH3-binding protein. The nucleotide sequence of a 4.1-kb C3G cDNA contains a 3.2-kb open reading frame encoding a 121-kDa protein, and antibodies against C3G have been shown to detect a protein of 130-140 kDa. The carboxyl terminus of C3G has a peptide sequence homologous to GNRPs for Ras, and the expression of this carboxyl terminus region suppresses the loss of CDC25 function in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The C3G protein expressed in Escherichia coli binds to CRK and GRB2/ASH proteins. Mutational analysis of C3G assigns the SH3 binding region to a 50-amino acid region containing a proline-rich sequence. The mRNAs of both the C3G and CRK proteins are expressed ubiquitously in human adult and fetal tissues. The results of these studies suggest that the complex of CRK and C3G, or GRB2/ASH and C3G, may transduce the signals from tyrosine kinases to Ras in a number of different tissues.

7513050|t|A novel mammalian protein, p55CDC, present in dividing cells is associated with protein kinase activity and has homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell division cycle proteins Cdc20 and Cdc4.
7513050|a|A novel protein, p55CDC, has been identified in cycling mammalian cells. This transcript is readily detectable in all exponentially growing cell lines but disappears when cells are chemically induced to fall out of the cell cycle and differentiate. The p55CDC protein appears to be essential for cell division, since transfection of antisense p55CDC cDNA into CHO cells resulted in isolation of only those cells which exhibited a compensatory increase in p55CDC transcripts in the sense orientation. Immunoprecipitation of p55CDC yielded protein complexes with kinase activity which fluctuated during the cell cycle. Since p55CDC does not have the conserved protein kinase domains, this activity must be due to one or more of the associated proteins in the immune complex. The highest levels of protein kinase activity were seen with alpha-casein and myelin basic protein as substrates and demonstrated a pattern of activity distinct from that described for the known cyclin-dependent cell division kinases. The p55CDC protein was also phosphorylated in dividing cells. The amino acid sequence of p55CDC contains seven repeats homologous to the beta subunit of G proteins, and the highest degree of homology in these repeats was found with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc20 and Cdc4 proteins, which have been proposed to be involved in the formation of a functional bipolar mitotic spindle in yeast cells. The G beta repeat has been postulated to mediate protein-protein interactions and, in p55CDC, may modulate its association with a unique cell cycle protein kinase. These findings suggest that p55CDC is a component of the mammalian cell cycle mechanism.

7520377|t|The immunoreactive region in a novel autoantigen contains a nuclear localization sequence.
7520377|a|Antibodies in the serum of patients with autoimmune diseases have been used to identify human autoantigens. Because autoantibodies often recognize active sites within corresponding protein antigens, autoantibodies have facilitated the functional characterization of these polypeptides. In the present study, serum from a patient with Sjögren's syndrome was used to identify a novel autoantigen which was designated Ge-1. Using the patient's serum, a 4.8-kb cDNA encoding Ge-1 was identified. Fragments of the cDNA were ligated into prokaryotic expression vectors, expressed in Escherichia coli, and used to produce recombinant Ge-1 fusion proteins. Fusion proteins containing different portions of Ge-1 were used to identify a 58 amino acid immunoreactive region within the protein. This immunoreactive region contained the protein's putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS). To demonstrate that the immunoreactive region was capable of functioning as a NLS, a eukaryotic expression plasmid was constructed to encode the immunoreactive region fused to the cytoplasmic protein, chicken muscle pyruvate kinase. After transfection of this plasmid into COS-1 cells, the fusion protein was detected in the nucleus. The presence of the NLS motif within the immunoreactive region of Ge-1 and other nuclear autoantigens suggests that the NLS may be a target of human autoantibodies.

7528931|t|Molecular characterization of an aquaporin cDNA from brain: candidate osmoreceptor and regulator of water balance.
7528931|a|The aquaporins transport water through membranes of numerous tissues, but the molecular mechanisms for sensing changes in extracellular osmolality and regulating water balance in brain are unknown. We have isolated a brain aquaporin by homology cloning. Like aquaporin 1 (AQP1, also known as CHIP, channel-forming integral membrane protein of 28 kDa), the deduced polypeptide has six putative transmembrane domains but lacks cysteines at the known mercury-sensitive sites. Two initiation sites were identified encoding polypeptides of 301 and 323 amino acids; expression of each in Xenopus oocytes conferred a 20-fold increase in osmotic water permeability not blocked by 1 mM HgCl2, even after substitution of cysteine at the predicted mercury-sensitive site. Northern analysis and RNase protection demonstrated the mRNA to be abundant in mature rat brain but only weakly detectable in eye, kidney, intestine, and lung. In situ hybridization of brain localized the mRNA to ependymal cells lining the aqueduct, glial cells forming the edge of the cerebral cortex and brainstem, vasopressin-secretory neurons in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of hypothalamus, and Purkinje cells of cerebellum. Its distinctive expression pattern implicates this fourth mammalian member of the aquaporin water channel family (designated gene symbol, AQP4) as the osmoreceptor which regulates body water balance and mediates water flow within the central nervous system.

7532304|t|Vasopressin increases water permeability of kidney collecting duct by inducing translocation of aquaporin-CD water channels to plasma membrane.
7532304|a|Water excretion by the kidney is regulated by the peptide hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin increases the water permeability of the renal collecting duct cells, allowing more water to be reabsorbed from collecting duct urine to blood. Despite long-standing interest in this process, the mechanism of the water permeability increase has remained undetermined. Recently, a molecular water channel (AQP-CD) has been cloned whose expression appears to be limited to the collecting duct. Previously, we immunolocalized this water channel to the apical plasma membrane (APM) and to intracellular vesicles (IVs) of collecting duct cells. Here, we test the hypothesis that vasopressin increases cellular water permeability by inducing exocytosis of AQP-CD-laden vesicles, transferring water channels from IVs to APM. Rat collecting ducts were perfused in vitro to determine water permeability and subcellular distribution of AQP-CD in the same tubules. The collecting ducts were fixed for immunoelectron microscopy before, during, and after exposure to vasopressin. Vasopressin exposure induced increases in water permeability and the absolute labeling density of AQP-CD in the APM. In parallel, the APM:IV labeling ratio increased. Furthermore, in response to vasopressin withdrawal, AQP-CD labeling density in the APM and the APM:IV labeling ratio decreased in parallel to a measured decrease in osmotic water permeability. We conclude that vasopressin increases the water permeability of collecting duct cells by inducing a reversible translocation of AQP-CD water channels from IVs to the APM.

7536611|t|Functional expression and pharmacological characterization of the human EAA4 (GluR6) glutamate receptor: a kainate selective channel subunit.
7536611|a|A cDNA encoding an ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit protein humEAA4 (GluR6), has been cloned from a human fetal brain library. This cDNA when expressed in COS or HEK-293 cells is associated with high-affinity kainate receptor binding and ion channel formation. We have successfully established cell lines stably expressing humEAA4 in HEK-293 cells This is the first report of the establishment of stable cell lines expressing a glutamate receptor channel. The relative potency of compounds for displacing [3H]-kainate binding to humEAA4 receptors expressed in COS or HEK-293 cells is domoate > kainate > quisqualate > 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione > L-glutamate = 6,7- dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione > dihydrokainate. Applications of kainate, glutamate, and domoate but not AMPA evoked rapidly desensitizing currents in cells expressing homo-oligomeric humEAA4 in a concentration dependent manner. The order of potency was: domoate > kainate > L-glutamate. Although AMPA did not itself activate humEAA4 receptors it did reduce, to a limited extent, kainate-evoked responses. AMPA may therefore be a weak partial agonist for this receptor. To date this effect has not been demonstrated with rat GluR6. It is possible that subtle species differences may exist in the nature of agonist receptor interaction. Kainate evoked currents were attenuated by the quinoxalinediones CNQX and DNQX but not by DAP5. The receptor desensitization was attenuated on application of concanavalin A. Ion-permeability studies indicated that the receptor-linked ion channel is permeable to both Na+ and Ca2+ ions.

7543898|t|Characterization of a novel Src-like adapter protein that associates with the Eck receptor tyrosine kinase.
7543898|a|The Eph family of receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) is the largest family of RPTKs. The signal transduction pathways initiated by this family have only recently begun to be explored. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify molecules that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of Eck, it was previously shown that activated Eck RPTK bound to and stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pandey, A., Lazar, D.F., Saltiel, A. R., and Dixit, V.M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30154-30157). Also isolated from this same screen was a novel protein containing SH3 and SH2 adapter modules that had striking homology to those found in the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. However, unlike other Src family members, it lacked a catalytic tyrosine kinase domain. Hence, this protein was designated SLAP for Src-like adapter protein. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion Proteins, it was demonstrated that SLAP bound to activated Eck receptor tyrosine kinase. Therefore, SLAP is a novel candidate downstream signaling intermediate and the first member of the Src family that resembles an adapter molecule.

7556170|t|Expression of central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors in human immune tissues and leukocyte subpopulations.
7556170|a|Two proteins with seven transmembrane-spanning domains typical of guanosine-nucleotide-binding-protein-coupled receptors have been identified as cannabinoid receptors; the central cannabinoid receptor, CB1, and the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, CB2, initially described in rat brain and spleen, respectively. Here, we report the distribution patterns for both CB1 and CB2 transcripts in human immune cells and in several human tissues, as analysed using a highly sensitive and quantitative PCR-based method. CB1 was mainly expressed in the central nervous system and, to a lower extent, in several peripheral tissues such as adrenal gland, heart, lung, prostate, uterus, ovary, testis, bone marrow, thymus and tonsils. In contrast, the CB2 gene, which is not expressed in the brain, was particularly abundant in immune tissues, with an expression level 10-100-fold higher than that of CB1. Although CB2 mRNA was also detected in some other peripheral tissues, its level remained very low. In spleen and tonsils, the CB2 mRNA content was equivalent to that of CB1 mRNA in the central nervous system. Among the main human blood cell subpopulations, the distribution pattern of the CB2 mRNA displayed important variations. The rank order of CB2 mRNA levels in these cells was B-cells > natural killer cells >> monocytes > polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells > T8 cells > T4 cells. The same rank order was also established in human cell lines belonging to the myeloid, monocytic and lymphoid lineages. The prevailing expression of the CB2 gene in immune tissues was confirmed by Northern-blot analysis. In addition, the expression of the CB2 protein was demonstrated by an immunohistological analysis performed on tonsil sections using specific anti-(human CB2) IgG; this experiment showed that CB2 expression was restricted to B-lymphocyte-enriched areas of the mantle of secondary lymphoid follicles. These results suggest that (a) CB1 and CB2 can be considered as tissue-selective antigens of the central nervous system and immune system, respectively, and (b) cannabinoids may exert specific receptor-mediated actions on the immune system through the CB2 receptor.

7556175|t|Molecular cloning and functional expression of the gene encoding the human proteinase-activated receptor 2.
7556175|a|We previously reported the molecular cloning of a mouse guanosine-nucleotide-binding-protein-coupled receptor similar to the thrombin receptor. Since the physiological agonist was unknown, the receptor was named proteinase-activated receptor 2. We describe here the cloning and functional expression of the gene encoding the corresponding human receptor. The gene is divided into two exons separated by about 14 kb intronic DNA. The deduced protein sequence is 397 amino acids long and 83% identical to the mouse receptor sequence. Within the extracellular amino terminus, the residues predicted to form the tethered agonist ligand differ between the two receptors; of the first six residues only four are conserved. At positions five and six, a lysine residue and a valine residue, respectively, have replaced arginine and leucine residues found in the mouse sequence. When the human receptor is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, it can be activated by low nanomolar concentrations of the serine proteinase trypsin and by peptides made from the receptor sequence. Northern-blot analysis of receptor expression showed that the receptor transcript is widely expressed in human tissues with especially high levels in pancreas, liver, kidney, small intestine and colon. Moderate expression was detected in many organs but none in brain or skeletal muscle. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the human proteinase-activated receptor 2 gene was mapped to chromosomal region 5q13, where, previously, the related thrombin receptor gene has been located.

7556196|t|A nuclear protein, synthesized in growth-arrested human hepatoblastoma cells, is a novel member of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family.
7556196|a|We have described a protein (Hep27) [Donadel, G., Garzelli, C., Frank, R. & Gabrielli, F. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 195, 723-729] which is synthesized and accumulated in the nucleus of human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells, following growth arrest induced by butyrate treatment. The synthesis of Hep27 is inhibited in cells that, released from the butyrate block, have resumed DNA synthesis. This report describes the cloning and the characterization of the cDNA coding for the Hep27 protein. The translation of the Hep27 cDNA predicts an amino acid sequence that can be aligned with those of the known short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes (SCAD) family. Both the recognition of enzymic functional domains and the similarity with the SCAD family of proteins of several amino acid blocks throughout the molecule, strongly suggest that this protein is a new member of the SCAD family. In agreement with its nuclear localization Hep27 has a region similar to the bipartite nuclear-targeting sequence. The study of Hep27 mRNA expression and protein synthesis suggests the existence of a regulation at the post-transcriptional level. The possible nuclear role of the Hep27 protein is discussed.

7624774|t|Interaction of papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins with a putative calcium-binding protein.
7624774|a|Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with the majority of cervical cancers and encode a transforming protein, E6, that interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. Because E6 has p53-independent transforming activity, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for other E6-binding proteins. One such protein, E6BP, interacted with cancer-associated HPV E6 and with bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E6. The transforming activity of BPV-1 E6 mutants correlated with their E6BP-binding ability. E6BP is identical to a putative calcium-binding protein, ERC-55, that appears to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.

7624799|t|Cloning and characterization of a G protein-activated human phosphoinositide-3 kinase.
7624799|a|Phosphoinositide-3 kinase activity is implicated in diverse cellular responses triggered by mammalian cell surface receptors and in the regulation of protein sorting in yeast. Receptors with intrinsic and associated tyrosine kinase activity recruit heterodimeric phosphoinositide-3 kinases that consist of p110 catalytic subunits and p85 adaptor molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. A phosphoinositide-3 kinase isotype, p110 gamma, was cloned and characterized. The p110 gamma enzyme was activated in vitro by both the alpha and beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G proteins) and did not interact with p85. A potential pleckstrin homology domain is located near its amino terminus. The p110 gamma isotype may link signaling through G protein-coupled receptors to the generation of phosphoinositide second messengers phosphorylated in the D-3 position.

7649249|t|Repression of transcriptional activity by heterologous KRAB domains present in zinc finger proteins.
7649249|a|We report the characterization of three novel members of the KRAB-domain containing C2-H2 zinc finger family (ZNF133, 136 and 140). KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) is an evolutionarily conserved protein domain found N-terminally with respect to the zinc finger repeats that encodes the DNA binding domain. ZNF133 and ZNF140 have both the KRAB A- and KRAB B-boxes present at their N-terminus, whereas ZNF136 contains only the KRAB A-box. We have previously demonstrated that the KRAB domains derived from ZNF133 and ZNF140 are potent transcriptional repression domains [Margolin et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 4509-4513]. The KRAB domain from ZNF136, containing only subdomain A, is a considerable weaker suppression domain; however, when fused to the heterologous KRAB B subdomain of ZNF10 (KOX1) the two subdomains from a KRAB domain which induces repression as potently as previously reported KRAB domains.

7651517|t|Molecular mechanism for an inherited cardiac arrhythmia.
7651517|a|In the congenital long-QT syndrome, prolongation of the cardiac action potential occurs by an unknown mechanism and predisposes individuals to syncope and sudden death as a result of ventricular arrhythmias. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for autosomal dominant long-QT syndrome by the identification of multiple distinct loci, and associated mutations in two candidate genes have recently been reported. One form of hereditary long QT (LQT3) has been linked to a mutation in the gene encoding the human heart voltage-gated sodium-channel alpha-subunit (SCN5A on chromosome 3p21). Here we characterize this mutation using heterologous expression of recombinant human heart sodium channels. Mutant channels show a sustained inward current during membrane depolarization. Single-channel recordings indicate that mutant channels fluctuate between normal and non-inactivating gating modes. Persistent inward sodium current explains prolongation of cardiac action potentials, and provides a molecular mechanism for this form of congenital long-QT syndrome.

7651522|t|A cap-binding protein complex mediating U snRNA export.
7651522|a|Cap structures are added cotranscriptionally to all RNA polymerase II transcripts. They affect several processes including RNA stability, pre-messenger RNA splicing, RNA export from the nucleus and translation initiation. The effect of the cap on translation is mediated by the initiation factor eIF-4F, whereas the effect on pre-mRNA splicing involves a nuclear complex (CBC) composed of two cap binding proteins, CBP80 and CBP20. A role for CBC in the nuclear export of capped RNAs has also been proposed. We report here the characterization of human and Xenopus CBP20s. Antibodies against recombinant CBP20 prevent interaction of CBC with capped RNAs in vitro. Following microinjection into Xenopus oocytes, the antibodies inhibit both pre-mRNA splicing and export of U small nuclear RNAs to the cytoplasm. These results demonstrate that CBC mediates the effect of the cap structure in U snRNA export, and provide direct evidence for the involvement of a cellular RNA-binding factor in the transport of RNA to the cytoplasm.

7663508|t|Hyperproinsulinaemia in obese fat/fat mice associated with a carboxypeptidase E mutation which reduces enzyme activity.
7663508|a|Mice homozygous for the fat mutation develop obesity and hyperglycaemia that can be suppressed by treatment with exogenous insulin. The fat mutation maps to mouse chromosome 8, very close to the gene for carboxypeptidase E (Cpe), which encodes an enzyme (CPE) that processes prohormone intermediates such as proinsulin. We now demonstrate a defect in proinsulin processing associated with the virtual absence of CPE activity in extracts of fat/fat pancreatic islets and pituitaries. A single Ser202Pro mutation distinguishes the mutant Cpe allele, and abolishes enzymatic activity in vitro. Thus, the fat mutation represents the first demonstration of an obesity-diabetes syndrome elicited by a genetic defect in a prohormone processing pathway.

7663511|a|We have identified a novel gene, Translin, encoding a protein which specifically binds to consensus sequences at breakpoint junctions of chromosomal translocations in many cases of lymphoid malignancies. The encoded protein, Translin, is a previously undescribed type with no significant similarity to known proteins. In the native form, Translin polypeptides form a multimeric structure which is responsible for its DNA binding activity. Nuclear localization of Translin is limited to lymphoid cell lines, raising the intriguing possibility that nuclear transport of Translin is regulated in a physiologically significant way such that active nuclear transport is associated with the lymphoid specific process known as Ig/TCR gene rearrangement.

7663524|t|Primary adhalinopathy: a common cause of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy of variable severity.
7663524|a|Marked deficiency of muscle adhalin, a 50 kDa sarcolemmal dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, has been reported in severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (SCARMD). This is a Duchenne-like disease affecting both males and females first described in Tunisian families. Adhalin deficiency has been found in SCARMD patients from North Africa Europe, Brazil, Japan and North America (SLR & KPC, unpublished data). The disease was initially linked to an unidentified gene on chromosome 13 in families from North Africa, and to the adhalin gene itself on chromosome 17q in one French family in which missense mutations were identified. Thus there are two kinds of myopathies with adhalin deficiency: one with a primary defect of adhalin (primary adhalinopathies), and one in which absence of adhalin is secondary to a separate gene defect on chromosome 13. We have examined the importance of primary adhalinopathies among myopathies with adhalin deficiency, and describe several additional mutations (null and missense) in the adhalin gene in 10 new families from Europe and North Africa. Disease severity varies in age of onset and rate of progression, and patients with null mutations are the most severely affected.

7683036|t|Structure and functional expression of the human macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha/RANTES receptor.
7683036|a|The chemokine beta family is comprised of at least six distinct cytokines that regulate trafficking of phagocytes and lymphocytes in mammalian species; at least one of these, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), also regulates the growth of hematopoietic stem cells. We now show that MIP-1 alpha and the related beta chemokine, RANTES, induce transient alterations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in polymorphonuclear leukocytes that can be reciprocally and specifically desensitized, suggesting a common receptor. Moreover, we have now cloned both the cDNA and the gene for this receptor, functionally expressed the receptor in Xenopus oocytes, and mapped the gene to human chromosome 3p21. Transcripts for the receptor were found in mature and immature myeloid cells as well as B cells. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. It has approximately 33% amino acid identity with receptors for the alpha chemokine, interleukin 8, and may be the human homologue of the product of US28, an open reading frame of human cytomegalovirus.

7729684|t|p57KIP2, a structurally distinct member of the p21CIP1 Cdk inhibitor family, is a candidate tumor suppressor gene.
7729684|a|Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are positive regulators of cell proliferation, whereas Cdk inhibitors (CKIs) inhibit proliferation. We describe a new CKI, p57KIP2, which is related to p21CIP1 and p27KIP1. p57KIP2 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes, and its binding is cyclin dependent. Unlike CIP1, KIP2 is not regulated by p53. Overexpression of p57KIP2 arrests cells in G1. p57KIP2 proteins have a complex structure. Mouse p57KIP2 consists of four structurally distinct domains: an amino-terminal Cdk inhibitory domain, a proline-rich domain, an acidic-repeat region, and a carboxy-terminal domain conserved with p27KIP1. Human p57KIP2 appears to have conserved the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains but has replaced the internal regions with sequences containing proline-alanine repeats. In situ hybridization during mouse embryogenesis revealed that KIP2 mRNA displays a striking pattern of expression during development, showing high level expression in skeletal muscle, brain, heart, lungs, and eye. Most of the KIP2-expressing cells are terminally differentiated, suggesting that p57KIP2 is involved in decisions to exit the cell cycle during development and differentiation. Human KIP2 is located at 11p15.5, a region implicated in both sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a familial cancer syndrome, marking it as a candidate tumor suppressor. The discovery of a new member of the p21CIP1 inhibitor family with novel structural features and expression patterns suggests a complex role for these proteins in cell cycle control and development.

7743998|t|A novel human protease similar to the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme induces apoptosis in transfected cells.
7743998|a|We have identified a novel cDNA encoding a protein (named TX) with > 50% overall sequence identity with the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) and approximately 30% sequence identity with the ICE homologs NEDD-2/ICH-1L and CED-3. A computer homology model of TX was constructed based on the X-ray coordinates of the ICE crystal recently published. This model suggests that TX is a cysteine protease, with the P1 aspartic acid substrate specificity retained. Transfection experiments demonstrate that TX is a protease which is able to cleave itself and the p30 ICE precursor, but not to generate mature IL-1 beta from pro-IL-1 beta. In addition, this protein induces apoptosis in transfected COS cells. TX therefore delineates a new member of the growing Ice/ced-3 gene family coding for proteases with cytokine processing activity or involved in programmed cell death.

7790363|t|The human E48 antigen, highly homologous to the murine Ly-6 antigen ThB, is a GPI-anchored molecule apparently involved in keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion.
7790363|a|The E48 antigen, a putative human homologue of the 20-kD protein present in desmosomal preparations of bovine muzzle, and formerly called desmoglein III (dg4), is a promising target antigen for antibody-based therapy of squamous cell carcinoma in man. To anticipate the effect of high antibody dose treatment, and to evaluate the possible biological involvement of the antigen in carcinogenesis, we set out to molecularly characterize the antigen. A cDNA clone encoding the E48 antigen was isolated by expression cloning in COS cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the clone contained an open reading frame of 128 amino acids, encoding a core protein of 13,286 kD. Database searching showed that the E48 antigen has a high level of sequence similarity with the mouse ThB antigen, a member of the Ly-6 antigen family. Phosphatidylinositol-specific (PI-specific) phospholipase-C treatment indicated that the E48 antigen is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI-anchored) to the plasma membrane. The gene encoding the E48 antigen is a single copy gene, located on human chromosome 8 in the 8q24-qter region. The expression of the gene is confined to keratinocytes and squamous tumor cells. The putative mouse homologue, the ThB antigen, originally identified as an antigen on cells of the lymphocyte lineage, was shown to be highly expressed in squamous mouse epithelia. Moreover, the ThB expression level is in keratinocytes, in contrast to that in lymphocytes, not mouse strain related. Transfection of mouse SV40-polyoma transformed mouse NIH/3T3 cells with the E48 cDNA confirmed that the antigen is likely to be involved in cell-cell adhesion.

7790377|t|Human peroxisomal targeting signal-1 receptor restores peroxisomal protein import in cells from patients with fatal peroxisomal disorders.
7790377|a|Two peroxisomal targeting signals, PTS1 and PTS2, are involved in the import of proteins into the peroxisome matrix. Human patients with fatal generalized peroxisomal deficiency disorders fall into at least nine genetic complementation groups. Cells from many of these patients are deficient in the import of PTS1-containing proteins, but the causes of the protein-import defect in these patients are unknown. We have cloned and sequenced the human cDNA homologue (PTS1R) of the Pichia pastoris PAS8 gene, the PTS1 receptor (McCollum, D., E. Monosov, and S. Subramani. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 121:761-774). The PTS1R mRNA is expressed in all human tissues examined. Antibodies to the human PTS1R recognize this protein in human, monkey, rat, and hamster cells. The protein is localized mainly in the cytosol but is also found to be associated with peroxisomes. Part of the peroxisomal PTS1R protein is tightly bound to the peroxisomal membrane. Antibodies to PTS1R inhibit peroxisomal protein-import of PTS1-containing proteins in a permeabilized CHO cell system. In vitro-translated PTS1R protein specifically binds a serine-lysine-leucine-peptide. A PAS8-PTS1R fusion protein complements the P. pastoris pas8 mutant. The PTS1R cDNA also complements the PTS1 protein-import defect in skin fibroblasts from patients--belonging to complementation group two--diagnosed as having neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy or Zellweger syndrome. The PTS1R gene has been localized to a chromosomal location where no other peroxisomal disorder genes are known to map. Our findings represent the only case in which the molecular basis of the protein-import deficiency in human peroxisomal disorders is understood.

7806211|t|Molecular cloning of the cDNA for human TrkC (NTRK3), chromosomal assignment, and evidence for a splice variant.
7806211|a|TrkC is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by neurotrophin-3, a factor important in the development of certain areas of the central nervous system. We have cloned and sequenced the human trkC cDNA and found that the predicted amino acid sequence is 97 to 98% homologous to the rat and porcine trkC sequences, respectively. The rat trkC has several isoforms due to alternative splicing in the tyrosine kinase domain. We cloned one human splice variant that has a nucleic acid sequence identical to the rat isoform with an insert of 14 amino acids. The human trkC cDNA also has a (CGG)n repeat in the 5'-untranslated region. This sequence was not highly polymorphic in that 79 of 80 chromosomes examined had eight repeats, while 1 chromosome had four repeats. By PCR analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and fluorescence in situ hybridization with the cDNA clone, human trkC was mapped to chromosome 15q24-q25.

7806230|t|Fibulin-2 (FBLN2): human cDNA sequence, mRNA expression, and mapping of the gene on human and mouse chromosomes.
7806230|a|Fibulin-2 is a new extracellular matrix protein that we recently identified by characterizing mouse cDNA clones. Fibulin-2 mRNA is prominently expressed in mouse heart tissue and is present in low amounts in other tissues. In this study, we isolated and sequenced a 4.1-kb human fibulin-2 cDNA, which encoded a mature protein of 1157 amino acids preceded by a 27-residue signal sequence. The predicted polypeptide contains three consecutive anaphylatoxin-related segments (domain I) in its central region followed by 10 EGF-like repeats (domain II), 9 of which have a consensus sequence for calcium binding. The 408-residue N-terminal region consists of two separate subdomains, a cysteine-rich segment of 150 residues (Na subdomain) and a cysteine-free segment with a stretch of acidic amino acids (Nb subdomain). The 115-residue C-terminal segment (domain III) is similar to the C variant of fibulin-1. The amino acid sequences of the human and mouse fibulin-2 share approximately 90% identity in domains Na, I, II, and III but only 62% identity in domain Nb. The human cDNA lacks an EGF-like repeat, which is alternatively spliced in the mouse cDNA clones, and a potential cell-binding Arg-Gly-Asp sequence found in the Nb domain of the mouse counterpart. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from various human tissues reveals an abundant 4.5-kb transcript in heart, placenta, and ovary tissue. The expression pattern differs from that of fibulin-1. The fibulin-2 gene was localized by in situ hybridization to the p24-p25 region of human chromosome 3 and to the band D-E of mouse chromosome 6.

7824954|t|Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators.
7824954|a|TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

7876089|t|ERGIC-53, a membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, is identical to MR60, an intracellular mannose-specific lectin of myelomonocytic cells.
7876089|a|A mannose-specific membrane lectin (MR60) isolated from human myelomonocytic HL60 cells by affinity chromatography is expressed in intracellular organelles of immature monocytes (Pimpaneau, V., Midoux, P., Monsigny, M., and Roche, A. C. (1991) Carbohydr. Res. 213, 95-108). It is not present at the cell surface and is immunochemically and structurally distinct from the M(r) 175,000 mannose receptor of mature macrophages. MR60 cDNA was isolated and characterized; on the basis of its sequence, MR60 is not related to any known mammalian lectins. Surprisingly, MR60 was found to be identical to ERGIC-53 (Schindler, R., Itin, C., Zerial, M., Lottspeich, F., and Hauri, H.P. (1993) Eur. J. Cell Biol. 61, 1-9), a type I integral membrane protein, defined as a marker of the intermediate compartment that recycles between the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum; MR60/ERGIC-53 shares with VIP-36 significant homologies with leguminous plant lectins (Fiedler, K., and Simmons, K. (1994) Cell 77, 625-626). We extend these findings in evidencing a structural homology between MR60/ERGIC-53 and mammalian galectins (soluble beta galactose binding proteins). MR60/ERGIC-53 is the first lectin characterized as an endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi protein. Accordingly, this intracellular mannose binding protein could be involved in the traffic of glycoproteins between endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.

7876093|t|Identification of a protein with homology to hsp90 that binds the type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor.
7876093|a|The yeast-based two hybrid has been used to identify a novel protein that binds to the intracellular domain of the type 1 receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNFR-1IC). The TNF receptor-associated protein, TRAP-1, shows strong homology to members of the 90-kDa family of heat shock proteins. After in vitro transcription/translation and 35S labeling, TRAP-1 was precipitated using a fusion protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase and TNFR-1IC, showing that the two proteins directly interact. The ability of deletion mutants of TNFR-1 to interact with TRAP-1 was tested using the two hybrid system. This showed that the amino acid sequences that mediate binding are diffusely distributed outside of the domain in the C terminus of TNFR-1IC that signals cytotoxicity. The 2.4-kilobase TRAP-1 mRNA was variably expressed in skeletal muscle, liver, heart, brain, kidney, pancreas, lung, and placenta. TRAP-1 mRNA was also detected in each of eight different transformed cell lines. Identification of TRAP-1 may be an important step toward defining how TNFR-1, which does not contain protein tyrosine kinase activity, transmits its message to signal transduction pathways.

7876099|t|Expression and kinetic characterization of recombinant human stomach alcohol dehydrogenase. Active-site amino acid sequence explains substrate specificity compared with liver isozymes.
7876099|a|A full-length 1966-base pair clone of the human class IV alcohol dehydrogenase (sigma-ADH) was isolated from a human stomach cDNA library. The 373-amino acid sigma-ADH encoded by this cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme for ethanol oxidation at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C, calculated from active-site titration of NADH binding, was 92 +/- 9 units/mg. Kinetic analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of recombinant sigma-ADH for oxidation of primary alcohols indicated broad substrate specificity. Recombinant human sigma-ADH exhibited high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. This pathway is important in the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator all-trans-retinoic acid. Secondary alcohols and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids were inactive with sigma-ADH or were oxidized with very low efficiency. The KM of sigma-ADH for ethanol was 25 mM, and the KM for primary straight chain alcohols decreased substantially as chain length increased. There are important amino acid differences in the alcohol-binding site between the human class IV (sigma) and human class I (beta) alcohol dehydrogenases that appear to explain the high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol, the high kcat for ethanol, and the low catalytic efficiency for secondary alcohols of sigma-ADH relative to beta 1-ADH. For example, modeling the binding of all-trans-retinol in the human beta 1-ADH structure suggested that coordination of retinol to the active-site zinc is hindered by a loop from residues 114 to 120 that is at the entrance to the alcohol-binding site. The deletion of Gly-117 in human sigma-ADH and a substitution of Leu for the bulky Tyr-110 appear to facilitate retinol access to the active-site zinc.

7905825|t|Cloning of human acetyl-CoA carboxylase cDNA.
7905825|a|Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biogenesis of long-chain fatty acids. In order to understand the mechanisms that regulate human acetyl-CoA carboxylase at the gene level, and the relationship between its structure and function, cDNA clones for human acetyl-CoA carboxylase have been isolated and sequenced. Human acetyl-CoA-carboxylase cDNA contains 7020 nucleotides encoding a protein of 2340 amino acids with a calculated relative molecular mass of 264575. The human enzyme shows approximately 85% identity in nucleotide sequence with previously cloned rat acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and shows 90% identity in the amino acid sequence. Two human acetyl-CoA-carboxylase mRNA species, which differ in the 5' untranslated region with the same coding sequence, have been identified. The sequence analysis reveals that type I and type II acetyl-CoA-carboxylase mRNA contain 313- and 173-base-long 5' untranslated regions, respectively. The first 240 nucleotides in the 5' untranslated region of type I acetyl-CoA-carboxylase mRNA replace the first 100 nucleotides of the (G + C)-rich region of the 5' untranslated region of the type II mRNA. These two species of mRNAs are the only species of human ACC mRNA which have been detected compared to at least five species in rat tissues, and they are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

7905839|t|Human mu opiate receptor. cDNA and genomic clones, pharmacologic characterization and chromosomal assignment.
7905839|a|A human mu opiate receptor cDNA has been identified from a cerebral cortical cDNA library using sequences from the rat mu opiate receptor cDNA. The human mu opiate receptor (h mu OR1) shares 95% amino acid identity with the rat sequence. The expressed mu OR1 recognized tested opiate drugs and opioid peptides in a sodium- and GTP-sensitive fashion with affinities virtually identical to those displayed by the rat mu opiate receptor. Effects on cyclic AMP are similar to those noted for the rat mu opiate receptor. An 18 kb genomic clone hybridizing with the h mu OR1 cDNA contains 63 and 489 bp exonic sequences flanked by splice donor/acceptor sequences. Analysis of hybridization to DNA prepared from human rodent hybrid cell lines and chromosomal in situ hybridization studies indicate localization to 6q24-25. An MspI polymorphism, producing a 3.7 kb band, may prove useful in assessing this gene's involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders involving opiatergic systems.

7913309|t|Human cytoplasmic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase: expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant wild-type and Cys129 mutant enzymes.
7913309|a|A cDNA for the human cytoplasmic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase (EC 4.1.3.5) was subcloned and expressed from a T7-based vector in Escherichia coli. The over-produced enzyme was purified using a three-step protocol that generated 20 to 30 mg protein/liter cell culture. The physical and catalytic properties of the recombinant synthase are similar to those reported for the nonrecombinant enzymes from chicken liver [Clinkenbeard et al. (1975a) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 3124-3135] and rat liver [Mehrabian et al. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16249-16255]. Mutation of Cys129 to serine or alanine destroys HMG-CoA synthase activity by disrupting the first catalytic step in HMG-CoA synthesis, enzyme acetylation by acetyl coenzyme A. Furthermore, unlike the wild-type enzyme, neither mutant was capable of covalent modification by the beta-lactone inhibitor, L-659,699 [Greenspan et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 7488-7492]. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition by L-659,699 revealed that this compound is a potent inhibitor of the recombinant human synthase, with an inhibition constant of 53.7 nM and an inactivation rate constant of 1.06 min-1.

7920628|t|Association between atopy and variants of the beta subunit of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor.
7920628|a|The beta-subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI-beta) on chromosome 11 is maternally linked to atopy, the state of enhanced IgE responsiveness underlying allergic asthma and rhinitis. We have identified a common variant of Fc epsilon RI-beta, lle181Leu within the 4th transmembrane domain. Leu181 shows significant association with positive IgE responses in a random patient sample. Amongst 60 unrelated nuclear families with allergic asthmatic probands, Leu181 is identified in 10 (17%), is maternally inherited in each, and shows a strong association with atopy. Our data indicate that Fc epsilon RI-beta, subject to maternal modification, may be the atopy-causing locus on chromosome 11q.

7920658|a|The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), a member of the large family of G protein-coupled receptors, controls both the function and growth of thyroid cells via stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. We report two different mutations in the TSHR gene of affected members of two large pedigrees with non-autoimmune autosomal dominant hyperthyroidism (toxic thyroid hyperplasia), that involve residues in the third (Val509Ala) and seventh (Cys672Tyr) transmembrane segments. When expressed by transfection in COS-7 cells, the mutated receptors display a higher constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase than wild type. This new disease entity is the germline counterpart of hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas, in which different somatic mutations with similar functional characteristics have been demonstrated.

7920659|a|X-linked hydrocephalus, spastic paraplegia type I and MASA syndrome are related disorders with loci in subchromosomal region Xq28. We have previously shown that X-linked hydrocephalus is caused by mutations in the gene for neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM), an axonal glycoprotein involved in neuronal migration and differentiation. Here we report mutations of the L1 gene in MASA syndrome and SPG1, in addition to HSAS families. Two of the HSAS mutations would abolish cell surface expression of L1 and represent the first functional null mutations in this disorder. Our results indicate that these three syndromes from part of a clinical spectrum resulting from a heterogeneous group of mutations in the L1 gene.

7925449|t|Bradykinin induces translocation of the protein kinase C isoforms alpha, epsilon, and zeta.
7925449|a|Bradykinin exerts a broad spectrum of cellular effects on different tissues. It is believed that these effects are predominantly mediated by the recently cloned B2 receptor. The mechanism of post-receptor signal transduction is not known in detail. Involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) was suggested and activation of the classical PKC isoforms alpha and beta was recently demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the B2 receptor also activates new (delta, epsilon) and atypical (zeta) PKC isoforms. To investigate this, chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, stably transfected with human B2 receptor, were used. In these cells the PKC isoforms alpha, delta, epsilon and zeta were detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. To monitor hormone-induced PKC translocation plasma membranes were prepared. Stimulation of the cells with bradykinin resulted in a rapid (30-60 s) translocation of the PKC isoforms alpha, epsilon, and zeta. Translocation of PKC delta was not detected. The effect of bradykinin was reduced by simultaneous addition of the receptor antagonist HOE 140, a bradykinin-related decapeptide. The data show that the B2 receptor in this cell model is able to activate, in addition to the classical PKC isoform alpha, the new PKC isoform epsilon and the atypical PKC isoform zeta. To test whether these effects are as well observed in a non-transfected cell, the experiments were repeated in human foreskin fibroblasts which naturally express high levels of B2 receptors. In this cell system similar results on PKC alpha, epsilon, and zeta were observed, suggesting that all three PKC isoforms are involved in signal transduction of the B2 receptor.

7925474|t|Protein structure of fetal antigen 1 (FA1). A novel circulating human epidermal-growth-factor-like protein expressed in neuroendocrine tumors and its relation to the gene products of dlk and pG2.
7925474|a|The present paper describes the primary structure, glycosylation and tissue localization of fetal antigen 1 (FA1) isolated from second-trimester human amniotic fluid. FA1 is a single-chained, heterogeneous glycoprotein of 225-262 amino acid residues. FA1 has six well conserved epidermal-growth-factor motifs and contains up to ten O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation sites, six of which are differentially glycosylated. Alignment to the translated sequences of Mus. musculus dlk and human dlk revealed 86% and 99% identity, respectively, to a 259-amino-acid residue overlap, and this high similarity extends with minor corrections to the human adrenal-specific mRNA, pG2 as well. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of FA1 in 10 out of 14 lung tumors containing neuroendocrine elements, and in the placental villi where FA1 was exclusively seen in stromal cells in close contact to the vascular structure. In the pancreas, FA1 co-localized with insulin in the insulin secretory granules of the beta cells within the islets of Langerhans. Our findings suggest that FA1 is synthesized as a membrane anchored protein and released into the circulation after enzymic cleavage, and that circulating FA1 represents the post-translationally modified gene product of human dlk which, in turn, is identical to human adrenal-specific mRNA pG2.

7957065|t|Human DNA helicase II: a novel DNA unwinding enzyme identified as the Ku autoantigen.
7957065|a|Human DNA helicase II (HDH II) is a novel ATP-dependent DNA unwinding enzyme, purified to apparent homogeneity from HeLa cells, which (i) unwinds exclusively DNA duplexes, (ii) prefers partially unwound substrates and (iii) proceeds in the 3' to 5' direction on the bound strand. HDH II is a heterodimer of 72 and 87 kDa polypeptides. It shows single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity, as well as double-stranded DNA binding capacity. All these activities comigrate in gel filtration and glycerol gradients, giving a sedimentation coefficient of 7.4S and a Stokes radius of approximately 46 A, corresponding to a native molecular weight of 158 kDa. The antibodies raised in rabbit against either polypeptide can remove from the solution all the activities of HDH II. Photoaffinity labelling with [alpha-32P]ATP labelled both polypeptides. Microsequencing of the separate polypeptides of HDH II and cross-reaction with specific antibodies showed that this enzyme is identical to Ku, an autoantigen recognized by the sera of scleroderma and lupus erythematosus patients, which binds specifically to duplex DNA ends and is regulator of a DNA-dependent protein kinase. Recombinant HDH II/Ku protein expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli cells showed DNA binding and helicase activities indistinguishable from those of the isolated protein. The exclusively nuclear location of HDH II/Ku antigen, its highly specific affinity for double-stranded DNA, its abundance and its newly demonstrated ability to unwind exclusively DNA duplexes, point to an additional, if still unclear, role for this molecule in DNA metabolism.

7957066|t|Cloning and characterization of seven human forkhead proteins: binding site specificity and DNA bending.
7957066|a|The forkhead domain is a monomeric DNA binding motif that defines a rapidly growing family of eukaryotic transcriptional regulators. Genetic and biochemical data suggest a central role in embryonic development for genes encoding forkhead proteins. We have used PCR and low stringency hybridization to isolate clones from human cDNA and genomic libraries that represent seven novel forkhead genes, freac-1 to freac-7. The spatial patterns of expression for the seven freac genes range from specific for a single tissue to nearly ubiquitous. The DNA binding specificities of four of the FREAC proteins were determined by selection of binding sites from random sequence oligonucleotides. The binding sites for all four FREAC proteins share a core sequence, RTAAAYA, but differ in the positions flanking the core. Domain swaps between two FREAC proteins identified two subregions within the forkhead domain as responsible for creating differences in DNA binding specificity. Applying a circular permutation assay, we show that binding of FREAC proteins to their cognate sites results in bending of the DNA at an angle of 80-90 degrees.

7970704|t|A new cytokine (IK) down-regulating HLA class II: monoclonal antibodies, cloning and chromosome localization.
7970704|a|The role of HLA class II Antigens in the control of the immune response is determined not only by the genetic polymorphism of these molecules, but also by their density on the cell surface. It is therefore essential to identify the signals that modulate HLA Class II gene activity in normal and neoplastic cells. We have purified a cytokine (IK factor, 19 kDa) secreted by the leukemic cell line K562 and several cancer cells, which inhibits HLA Class II antigen induction by IFN-gamma. We produced specific mAbs which antagonize the biological effect of IK in colon carcinoma Colo 205 cells induced to express HLA-DR molecules by IFN-gamma. Moreover, in Colo 205, HLA-DR can also be induced by the protein synthesis inhibitor Cycloheximide (0.1 micrograms ml-1); and addition of IK factor almost completely abolishes HLA class II expression. We have also performed the cloning and the sequencing of a specific cDNA. This probe recognizes a 2.1 Kb mRNA in different cell types. The nucleotide sequence exhibits no homologies with known cytokines. IK gene localization shows that it maps on chromosome 2p15-p14. The transient transfection of the cDNA in COS cells induces the secretion of a biologically active 19 kDa protein which is recognized in Western blot by 1C5B11 blocking mAb. This paper reports the characterization of a new cytokine down-regulating HLA class II Antigens, whose analysis will help to better understand HLA class II gene regulation and the mechanism of escape from immunorecognition in cancer cells.

7970727|t|BMX, a novel nonreceptor tyrosine kinase gene of the BTK/ITK/TEC/TXK family located in chromosome Xp22.2.
7970727|a|The Bmx sequence was identified and cloned during our search for novel tyrosine kinase genes expressed in human bone marrow cells. Bmx cDNA comprises a long open reading frame of 675 amino acids, containing one SH3, one SH2 and one tyrosine kinase domain, which are about 70% identical with Btk, Itk and Tec and somewhat less with Txk tyrosine kinase sequences. The amino terminal sequences of these four tyrosine kinases are about 40% identical and each contains a so-called pleckstrin homology domain. The 2.7 kb Bmx mRNA was expressed in endothelial cells and several human tissues by Northern blotting and an 80 kD Bmx polypeptide was detected in human endothelial cells. Immunoprecipitates of COS cells transfected with a Bmx expression vector and NIH3T3 cells expressing a Bmx retrovirus contained a tyrosyl phosphorylated Bmx polypeptide of similar molecular weight. The BMX gene was located in chromosomal band Xp22.2 between the DXS197 and DXS207 loci. Interestingly, chromosome X also contains the closest relative of BMX, the BTK gene, implicated in X-linked agammaglobulinemia. The BMX gene thus encodes a novel nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, which may play a role in the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells.

8036022|t|Cloning and characterisation of cDNAs encoding a novel non-receptor tyrosine kinase, brk, expressed in human breast tumours.
8036022|a|Using a polymerase chain reaction based differential screening approach, we have isolated and characterised a cDNA from a human metastatic breast tumour representing a novel protein tyrosine kinase (brk). Sequencing of brk cDNAs isolated from T-47D and MCF-7 human breast tumour cell lines indicate that they encode a protein with the features of a novel nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, including amino terminal SH3 and SH2 domains. When synthesised in recombinant baculovirus and bacterial expression systems, brk protein products are capable of autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Initial expression studies have detected low levels of brk transcripts in some human breast tumours and breast tumour cell lines, but not in normal breast tissue.

8062391|t|Purification, cloning, and characterization of a human coactivator, PC4, that mediates transcriptional activation of class II genes.
8062391|a|Activator-dependent transcription in mammalian cells requires upstream stimulatory activity (USA)-derived cofactors in addition to those present in TFIID. A novel positive cofactor (PC4) purified from the human USA fraction effected a marked enhancement (up to 85-fold) of GAL4-AH-dependent transcription in conjunction with TFIID and other general factors. Isolation of a corresponding cDNA identified PC4 as a 127 residue single-stranded DNA-binding protein with serine-rich regions near the N-terminus. Recombinant PC4 was functionally equivalent to native PC4, and both proteins markedly enhanced activation by diverse activation domains fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. Recombinant PC4 interacted independently both with free or DNA-bound VP16 activation domains and with free or DNA-bound TFIIA-TBP complexes (but not with TBP alone). These results indicate that PC4 is a general coactivator that functions cooperatively with TAFs and mediates functional interactions between upstream activators and the general transcriptional machinery.

8159699|t|Molecular cloning, sequencing, and functional expression of a cDNA encoding human coproporphyrinogen oxidase.
8159699|a|Coproporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.3) catalyzes the sixth step in the heme biosynthetic pathway, the oxidation of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX. The activity of this enzyme is deficient in the disease hereditary coproporphyria. The sequence of the cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence of the human coproporphyrinogen oxidase are presented. The human protein sequence contains a region completely homologous to that we obtained by sequencing an 11-amino acid peptide fragment from purified murine liver coproporphyrinogen oxidase. Results of Southern blotting were consistent with the presence of a single human coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene, and Northern blotting demonstrated one transcript of similar size in erythroid and nonerythroid cell lines. Expression of the cDNA coding for the putative mature human coproporphyrinogen oxidase in Escherichia coli resulted in a 17-fold increase in coproporphyrinogen activity over endogenous activity.

8167223|t|Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel human sperm antigen (HE2) specifically expressed in the proximal epididymis.
8167223|a|A novel human cDNA encoding a small secretory glycopeptide specifically expressed within the caput and proximal corpus regions of the human epididymis, HE2, has been cloned and sequenced. Southern hybridization analysis showed it to be derived from a single-copy gene. A subclone containing the coding region of the mature peptide was used to generate the putatively encoded peptide as a 10,000 M(r) recombinant fusion protein in a bacterial expression system. This recombinant HE2 protein, as well as an oligopeptide deduced from the open-reading frame, was used to raise polyclonal antisera. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence showed that the predicted HE2 peptide is present in the epididymal epithelium and on the sperm surface, where it adopts a typical antigenic pattern with a subacrosomal equatorial distribution on the sperm head.

8182091|t|Human liver nicotinamide N-methyltransferase. cDNA cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization.
8182091|a|Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) catalyzes the N-methylation of nicotinamide and other pyridines. Human liver NNMT activity has a bimodal frequency distribution, an observation which raises the possibility that this enzyme activity might be regulated by a genetic polymorphism, a polymorphism that could have functional implications for individual differences in drug and xenobiotic toxicity. As a first step toward testing that hypothesis, we set out to clone and express a cDNA for human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT was partially purified, photoaffinity-labeled, subjected to limited proteolysis, and partial amino acid sequence information was obtained. The polymerase chain reaction was then used to amplify a 550-nucleotide sequence with human liver cDNA as template and primers designed on the basis of the NNMT amino acid sequence. The 5'- and 3'-ends of a human liver NNMT cDNA were obtained by use of the rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The combined use of these approaches resulted in the isolation of a human liver NNMT cDNA that was 969 nucleotides in length, with a 792-nucleotide open reading frame that encoded a 264-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. The human liver NNMT cDNA was transcribed in vitro and translated with a reticulocyte lysate system to yield a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 29 kDa that comigrated during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with photoaffinity-labeled human liver NNMT. The NNMT cDNA was also subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector p91023(B). COS-1 cells transfected with this construct expressed a high level of NNMT enzymatic activity, and the biochemical properties of this activity were similar to those of human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT and transfected COS-1 cell NNMT had apparent Km values for the two cosubstrates for the reaction, nicotinamide and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, of 0.43 and 0.38 mM and of 1.8 and 2.2 microM, respectively. IC50 values for the inhibition of NNMT by N1-methylnicotinamide were 60 and 30 microns for human liver and COS-1 cell-expressed NNMT, respectively. Cloning of a cDNA for human liver NNMT will help make it possible to test the hypothesis that inheritance may play a role in the regulation of individual differences in human liver NNMT activity.

8204608|t|Purification and characterization of the recombinant human calcium-binding S100 proteins CAPL and CACY.
8204608|a|The S100 proteins CAPL and CACY are expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific manner and have been reported to be associated with the metastatic phenotype of tumor cells. In order to study the biochemical, cation-binding, and conformational properties, we produced and purified large amounts of the recombinant human proteins in Escherichia coli. Several characteristics of native proteins are shown to correspond to those of the bacterially expressed proteins. Both are able to form homodimers in vitro, probably the biologically active species, but not heterodimers. The Ca(2+)-binding parameters were studied by flow offlysis at physiological ionic strength. Both isotherms show a maximum of two Ca2+ per protein and are insensitive to Mg2+, indicating that the sites are of the Ca(2+)-specific type. The isotherms show slight (CAPL, nH = 1.15) or pronounced (CACY, nH = 1.33) positive cooperativity with K0.5 values of 0.32 mM (CACY) and 0.15 mM (CAPL), indicating that the sites are of the low-affinity type. Conformational changes in the Tyr microenvironment of CACY indicate that Ca2+ binding induces a shift of Tyr to a less polar environment. Mg2+ does not affect the fluorescence properties nor does it induce a difference spectrum, thus suggesting that at physiological ionic conditions it does not interact with the protein. The Ca(2+)-induced difference spectra of CAPL are about 3 times smaller than those of CACY, suggesting that the additional Tyr84 in CACY is much more sensitive to Ca2+ than the two Tyr residues conserved in both proteins.

8243272|t|Human G(olf) alpha: complementary deoxyribonucleic acid structure and expression in pancreatic islets and other tissues outside the olfactory neuroepithelium and central nervous system.
8243272|a|G(olf) alpha is a G-protein originally believed to mediate signal transduction exclusively within the olfactory neuroepithelium and subsequently found to be a major stimulatory G-protein in the basal ganglia. Here we present evidence that G(olf) alpha is expressed in several other tissues. The human isoform of G(olf) alpha was isolated from two human insulinoma cDNA libraries. Comparison of the human sequence with rat G(olf) alpha shows 91% nucleotide identity (within the coding region) and 99% identity at the amino acid level. Northern and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that G(olf) alpha is expressed in all human insulinomas examined thus far as well as in normal pancreatic islets. G(olf) alpha mRNA was also detected in testis, retina, brain, and liver. Western blot analysis of various mouse tissues demonstrated that the level of G(olf) alpha protein in islets is lower than that in the olfactory neuroepithelium and other parts of the brain; its expression in retina, lung, and spleen was moderately higher than that in islets, and its expression in testis approached that in olfactory neuroepithelium. G(olf) alpha was also detected by immunohistochemistry in mouse islets, human insulinomas, the epithelial lining of mouse epididymis, photoreceptor cells of mouse retina, and mouse lung alveoli. These findings suggest a role for G(olf) alpha in a diverse population of cells located outside the olfactory neuroepithelium and central nervous system.

8248204|t|cDNAs encoding the large subunit of human replication factor C.
8248204|a|Replication factor C (RFC) is a multisubunit, DNA polymerase accessory protein required for the coordinated synthesis of both DNA strands during simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro. Previous studies have shown that RFC is a DNA-dependent ATPase that binds in a structure-specific manner to the 3' end of a primer hybridized to a template DNA, an activity thought intrinsic to the 140-kDa component of this multisubunit complex. Here, the isolation and analysis of cDNAs encoding this subunit is described. Analysis of the full-length coding sequence revealed an open reading frame of 3.4 kb, encoding an 1148-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 130 kDa. A putative ATP-binding motif was observed that is similar to a motif in several of the smaller subunits of RFC and in functionally homologous replication factors of bacterial and viral origin. A " DEAD " box is also conserved among these proteins. The predicted protein shows significant identity with a DNA-binding protein of murine origin (B. Luckow, P. Lichter, and G. Schütz, personal communication). Regions of similarity were also seen between the amino acid sequences of the 140-kDa subunit of RFC, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and bacterial DNA ligases--possibly representing a conserved structural feature of these proteins that bind similar DNA substrates.

8248209|t|Molecular cloning and centrosomal localization of human caltractin.
8248209|a|Caltractin, a 20-kDa calcium-binding protein, was previously purified and cloned at the DNA level from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas. It is a structural component of the basal body complex, the major microtubule-organizing center in Chlamydomonas and the functional homolog of the centrosome in the animal cell. Here we report the characterization of a cDNA encoding a human caltractin that shares a high degree of amino acid identity (70%) with its algal counterpart. Caltractin was identified in both HeLa and BHK cells as a 21-kDa polypeptide specifically localized to the centrosome of interphase and mitotic cells. The high level of conservation in the amino acid sequence of caltractin from algae to humans and its association with the major microtubule-organizing center in the cell suggest that caltractin plays a fundamental role in microtubule-organizing center structure and function.

8248217|t|Genomic binding-site cloning reveals an estrogen-responsive gene that encodes a RING finger protein.
8248217|a|Estrogen receptor (ER)-binding fragments were isolated from human genomic DNA by using a recombinant ER protein. Using one of these fragments as a probe, we have identified an estrogen-responsive gene that encodes a putative zinc finger protein. It has a RING finger motif present in a family of apparent DNA-binding proteins and is designated estrogen-responsive finger protein (efp). efp cDNA contains a consensus estrogen-responsive element at the 3' untranslated region that can act as a downstream estrogen-dependent enhancer. Moreover, efp is regulated by estrogen as demonstrated at both the mRNA and the protein level in ER-positive cells derived from mammary gland. These data suggest that efp may represent an estrogen-responsive transcription factor that mediates phenotypic expression of the diverse estrogen action. Thus, the genomic binding-site cloning may be applicable for isolation of the target genes of other transcription factors.

8248235|t|A human mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease that is highly homologous to bacterial Lon protease.
8248235|a|We have cloned a human ATP-dependent protease that is highly homologous to members of the bacterial Lon protease family. The cloned gene encodes a protein of 963 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 106 kDa, slightly higher than that observed by Western blotting the protein from human tissues and cell lines (100 kDa). A single species of mRNA was found for this Lon protease in all human tissues examined. The protease is encoded in the nucleus, and the amino-terminal portion of the protein sequence contains a potential mitochondrial targeting presequence. Immunofluorescence microscopy suggested a predominantly mitochondrial localization for the Lon protease in cultured human cells. A truncated LON gene, in which translation was initiated at Met118 of the coding sequence, was expressed in Escherichia coli and produced a protease that degraded alpha-casein in vitro in an ATP-dependent manner and had other properties similar to E. coli Lon protease.

8248242|t|Molecular cloning of cDNA encoding an unrecognized component of amyloid in Alzheimer disease.
8248242|a|A neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) is a widespread amyloid deposition. We analyzed the entire amino acid sequences in an amyloid preparation and found, in addition to the major beta/A4-protein (A beta) fragment, two unknown peptides. We raised antibodies against synthetic peptides using subsequences of these peptides. These antibodies immunostained amyloid in neuritic and diffuse plaques as well as vascular amyloid. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the immunostaining was localized on amyloid fibrils. We have isolated an apparently full-length cDNA encoding a 140-amino-acid protein within which two previously unreported amyloid sequences are encoded in tandem in the most hydrophobic domain. We tentatively named this 35-amino acid peptide NAC (non-A beta component of AD amyloid) and its precursor NACP. NAC is the second component, after A beta, identified chemically in the purified AD amyloid preparation. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the NAC peptide sequence has a strong tendency to form beta-structures consistent with its association with amyloid. NACP is detected as a M(r) 19,000 protein in the cytosolic fraction of brain homogenates and comigrates on immunoblots with NACP synthesized in Escherichia coli from NACP cDNA. NACP mRNA is expressed principally in brain but is also expressed in low concentrations in all tissues examined except in liver, suggesting its ubiquitous and brain-specific functions. The availability of the cDNA encoding full-length NACP should help to elucidate the mechanisms of amyloidosis in AD.

8248256|t|Cloning of Nrf1, an NF-E2-related transcription factor, by genetic selection in yeast.
8248256|a|We have devised a complementation assay in yeast to clone mammalian transcriptional activators and have used it to identify a human basic leucine-zipper transcription factor that we have designated Nrf1 for NF-E2-related factor 1. Nrf1 potentially encodes a 742-aa protein and displays marked homology to the mouse and human NF-E2 transcription factors. Nrf1 activates transcription via NF-E2 binding sites in yeast cells. The ubiquitous expression pattern of Nrf1 and the range of promoters containing the NF-E2 binding motif suggest that this gene may play a role in the regulation of heme synthesis and ferritin genes.

8394174|t|Recessive mutations in the gene encoding the beta-subunit of rod phosphodiesterase in patients with retinitis pigmentosa.
8394174|a|We have found four mutations in the human gene encoding the beta-subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE beta) that cosegregate with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative disease of photoreceptors. In one family two affected siblings both carry allelic nonsense mutations at codons 298 and 531. Affected individuals have abnormal rod and cone electroretinograms. PDE beta is the second member of the phototransduction cascade besides rhodopsin that is absent or altered as a cause of retinitis pigmentosa, suggesting that other members of this pathway may be defective in other forms of this disease.

The map position of lyt-10, inferred from its isolation from a t(10;14)(q24;q32) translocation, has been confirmed.

8428657|t|Cloning, sequencing and expression of a cDNA encoding mammalian valyl-tRNA synthetase.
8428657|a|A fragment of the cDNA encoding a rat valyl-tRNA synthetase (TrsVal)-like protein was cloned from a rat cDNA library in lambda gt11 using an oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) probe. Three independent plaque clones containing the human TrsVal cDNA were then isolated from a lambda gt10 human erythroleukemia cDNA library using the rat cDNA fragment as the hybridization probe. Sequence analyses of the cDNA fragments provided a 3.2-kb sequence with an open reading frame that contained the 'HIGH' synthetase signature sequence and the tRNA 3'-end-binding motif, KMSKS, and putative Val-binding motif, EWCISRQ. The sequence was extended to the 3' end of the cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction using an internal primer and an oligo(dT) adapter. The deduced 1051-amino-acid sequence shares 65% identity with yeast TrsVal, and contains a highly basic N-terminal region, a newly evolved protease-sensitive region in sequence close to the C terminus, and several sites for protein kinase C phosphorylation. A 3-kb cDNA fragment was sub-cloned into plasmid pSVL and expressed in COS-7 cells; up to a sevenfold increase in TrsVal activity was obtained. These results confirm the cloning and sequencing of a human TrsVal-encoding cDNA.

8428750|t|Localization of the intronless gene coding for calmodulin-like protein CLP to human chromosome 10p13-ter.
8428750|a|The functional intronless gene coding for a calmodulin-like protein (CLP) has been localized to human chromosome 10p13-ter. Chromosomal assignment was performed by Southern blot analysis of DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and amplification of a CLP gene-specific 1090-bp DNA fragment by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA from human-hamster cell hybrids. Chromosomal sublocalization was carried out by in situ hybridization of human chromosome metaphase spreads. The CLP gene is the first member of the human calmodulin/calmodulin-like gene family to be chromosomally sublocalized. Its presence near the telomeric end of the short arm of chromosome 10 may be of significance with respect to its highly (epithelial) cell-type restricted expression in vivo and strong downregulation upon malignant transformation. The generation of a human CLP gene-specific sequence tag site specified by the two primers used for PCR should prove useful for future linkage studies.

8486631|t|A novel form of cytochrome P-450 family 4 in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. cDNA cloning and expression of leukotriene B4 omega-hydroxylase.
8486631|a|Isolation of cDNA clones for human leukotriene B4 (LTB4) omega-hydroxylase clearly demonstrates that the hydroxylase is a member of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) superfamily. cDNA clones isolated from a human leukocyte cDNA library with CYP4A4 cDNA as a probe encode a protein of 520 amino acids with a molecular weight of 59,805. The deduced amino acid sequence contains an invariant cysteine in the conserved heme-binding domain near the C terminus, characteristic of the P-450 superfamily. The microsomes from yeast cells transfected with an expression vector pAAH5 carrying isolated cDNA catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of LTB4 with a Km value of 0.71 microM, and its activity was significantly inhibited by carbon monoxide and by antisera against CYP4A4, consistent with the properties previously reported with LTB4 omega-hydroxylase in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The amino acid sequence of LTB4 omega-hydroxylase (P-450LTB omega) shows 31-44% similarity to those of CYP4A, CYP4B, and CYP4C, whereas less than 25% similarity was observed with any of the other P-450 families. According to the systematic classification of the P-450 superfamily, P-450LTB omega is classified into the CYP4 family but does not belong to any of the known CYP4 subfamilies. This P-450 composes a new subfamily of CYP4. RNA blot analysis indicated that mRNA hybridized to the cDNA was expressed in the polymorphonuclear leukocytes as well as leukocytes from four individuals. Isolation of the cDNA opens the way to investigate the physiological role and to regulation of the omega-hydroxylase in the inflammation process.

8486689|t|Molecular cloning of the cDNA for the catalytic subunit of human DNA polymerase epsilon.
8486689|a|The cDNA encoding the catalytic polypeptide of human DNA polymerase epsilon was cloned. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals that the catalytic polypeptide is 2257 amino acids in length and its calculated molecular mass is 258 kDa. A single RNA message of 7.5 kilobases was recognized by isolated cDNA clones. The identity of the cDNA was verified by direct amino acid sequencing of tryptic fragments derived from the catalytic polypeptide of the HeLa DNA polymerase epsilon. The primary structure comparison with multiple DNA polymerases indicates that human DNA polymerase epsilon catalytic polypeptide is a homolog of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase II catalytic polypeptide. The proteins are 39% identical. In the region containing known DNA polymerase consensus motifs, the identity is 63%. The expression of the mRNA encoding DNA polymerase epsilon is strongly dependent on cell proliferation.

8504797|t|cDNA cloning and mitochondrial import of the beta-subunit of the human electron-transfer flavoprotein.
8504797|a|We have isolated a cDNA clone which encodes the entire beta-subunit of human electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) by screening an expression library from human liver using polyclonal antibodies against porcine ETF. This cDNA encodes a protein of 255 amino-acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 27,877 Da which shows a high degree of similarity with partial amino-acid sequences obtained from both rat liver and Paracoccus denitrificans beta-ETF. Northern-blot analysis shows that the human beta-ETF mRNA is approximately 1 kb in size and is abundant in liver, heart and skeletal muscle. Incubation with intact mitochondria indicates that the cDNA-encoded beta-ETF polypeptide contains the information necessary to reach the mitochondrial matrix. These data are in agreement with previous experiments suggesting that beta-ETF, unlike the majority of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial matrix proteins, does not have a cleavable leader peptide. Furthermore, when valinomycin is added to the incubation mixture, the import is abolished, thus demonstrating that it is an energy-dependent process. Interestingly, the sequence analysis of beta-ETF protein identifies a 26.3% identity with the Fix A gene product of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azorhizobium caulinodans.

8505317|t|Cloning of human cDNAs encoding mitochondrial and cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferases and chromosomal localization.
8505317|a|Human cDNAs for cytosolic and mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) were cloned by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli glyA mutant with a human cDNA library. The cDNA for the cytosolic enzyme encodes a 483-residue protein of M(r) 53,020. The cDNA for the mitochondrial enzyme encodes a mature protein of 474 residues of M(r) 52,400. The deduced protein sequences share a high degree of sequence identity to each other (63%), and the individual isozymes are highly homologous to the analogous rabbit liver cytosolic (92% identity) and mitochondrial (97% identity) SHMT isozymes (Martini, F., Angelaccio, S., Pascarella, S., Barra, D., Bossa, F., and Schirch, V. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5499-5509; Martini, F., Maras, B., Tanci, P., Angelaccio, S., Pascarella, S., Barra, D., Bossa, F., and Schirch, V. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8509-8519). SHMT is a highly conserved protein with the human isozymes retaining about 43% sequence identity with the E. coli protein. The human cytosolic and mitochondrial SHMT genes were localized to chromosome regions 17p11.2 and 12q13, respectively. The high degree of nucleotide sequence identity between the two isozymes, and the presence of keratin genes in both chromosomal regions, is consistent with these regions of chromosome 12 and 17 arising by a duplication event.

CaN is the target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506, which inhibit CaN after forming complexes with cytoplasmic binding proteins (cyclophilin and FKBP12, respectively). We report here the crystal structures of full-length human CaN at 2.1 A resolution and of the complex of human CaN with FKBP12-FK506 at 3.5 A resolution. In the native CaN structure, an auto-inhibitory element binds at the Zn/Fe-containing active site. The metal-site geometry and active-site water structure suggest a catalytic mechanism involving nucleophilic attack on the substrate phosphate by a metal-activated water molecule. In the FKBP12-FK506-CaN complex, the auto-inhibitory element is displaced from the active site. The site of binding of FKBP12-FK506 appears to be shared by other non-competitive inhibitors of calcineurin, including a natural anchoring protein.

8551235|t|HCC-1, a novel chemokine from human plasma.
8551235|a|A novel CC chemokine, HCC-1, was isolated from the hemofiltrate of patients with chronic renal failure. HCC-1 has a relative molecular mass of 8,673 and consists of 74 amino acids including four cysteines linked to disulfide bonds. HCC-1 cDNA was cloned from human bone marrow and shown to code for the mature protein plus a putative 19-residue leader sequence. Mature HCC-1 has sequence identity of 46% with macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta, and 29-37% with the other human CC chemokines. Unlike MIP-1 alpha and the other CC chemokines, HCC-1 is expressed constitutively in several normal tissues (spleen, liver, skeletal and heart muscle, gut, and bone marrow), and is present at high concentrations (1-80 nM) in plasma. HCC-1 has weak activities on human monocytes and acts via receptors that also recognize MIP-1 alpha. It induced intracellular Ca2+ changes and enzyme release, but no chemotaxis, at concentrations of 100-1,000 nM, and was inactive on T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophil leukocytes. In addition, HCC-1 enhanced the proliferation of CD34+ myeloid progenitor cells. It was as effective as MIP-1 alpha, but about 100-fold less potent.

8555498|t|LAF-4 encodes a lymphoid nuclear protein with transactivation potential that is homologous to AF-4, the gene fused to MLL in t(4;11) leukemias.
8555498|a|A novel human gene, LAF-4, was isolated from a subtracted cDNA library that showed strong sequence similarity to AF-4, a gene that is translocated in t(4;11)(q21;q23) acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In t(4;11) ALL, the AF-4 gene at 4q21 is translocated into the MLL locus at 11q23, resulting in the expression of an MLL/AF-4 fusion protein that is the presumptive oncoprotein. AF-4 and LAF-4 are homologous throughout their coding regions, yet neither protein is related to previously cloned genes. Human LAF-4 readily hybridized with genes in mouse and chicken, thus showing that this gene family has been highly conserved during vertebrate evolution. In mouse tissues, LAF-4 mRNA was found to be present at highest levels in lymphoid tissues, present at lower levels in brain and lung, and absent from other tissues. In human and mouse lymphoid cell lines, LAF-4 expression was highest in pre-B cells, intermediate in mature B cells, and absent in plasma cells, thus pointing to a potential regulatory role for LAF-4 in lymphoid development. Antibodies to LAF-4 showed it to be a nuclear protein that showed an uneven, granular immunofluorescence pattern. In vitro-translated LAF-4 was able to bind strongly to double-stranded DNA cellulose. Furthermore, both LAF-4 and AF-4 had domains that activated transcription strongly when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, the AF-4 transactivation domain is retained in the MLL/AF-4 fusion protein; thus, it may contribute to the transforming potential of the oncoprotein. Therefore, the cloning of LAF-4 has defined a new family of potential regulatory proteins that may function in lymphoid development and oncogenesis.

8563171|t|A human ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, L-UBC, maps in the Alzheimer's disease locus on chromosome 14q24.3.
8563171|a|We have identified a novel ubiquitin conjugating enzyme gene, L-UBC, which maps to human Chromosome (Chr) 14q24.3. This is also the location of the major early onset familial Alzheimer's disease gene (FAD3). L-UBC encodes a protein that demonstrates homology to the yeast ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UBC-4, and human UbcH5. Their functions are to ubiquitinate specific proteins targeted for degradation. The protein also exhibits very strong homology to a rabbit protein, E2-F1, which mediates p53 degradation driven by papilloma virus E6 protein in vitro. The accumulation of specific proteins that have undergone aberrant processing in neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques is the classic pathological feature in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Abnormal ubiquitination has previously been suggested to play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. This gene therefore represents a plausible candidate gene for FAD3.

8579579|a|Autotaxin, a potent human tumor cell motility-stimulating exophosphodiesterase, was isolated and cloned from the human teratocarcinoma cell line NTera2D1. The deduced amino acid sequence for the teratocarcinoma autotaxin has 94% identity to the melanoma-derived protein, 90% identity to rat brain phosphodiesterase I/nucleotide pyrophosphatase (PD-I alpha), and 44% identity to the plasma cell membrane marker PC-I. Utilizing polymerase chain reaction screening of the CEPH YAC library, we localized the autotaxin gene to human chromosome 8q23-24. Northern blot analysis of relative mRNA from multiple human tissues revealed that autotaxin mRNA steady state expression is most abundant in brain, placenta, ovary, and small intestine.

8579597|a|A cDNA encoding a possible novel human 116-kDa polypeptide subunit of the osteoclastic proton pump (OC-116KDa) has been identified by differential screening of a human osteoclastoma cDNA library. The predicted sequence of OC-116kDa consists of 822 amino acids and is 46.9% and 47.2% identical at the amino acid level to the 116-KDa polypeptide of the vacuolar proton pump of rat and bovine brain respectively. OC-116KDa mRNA was found at high levels in osteoclastomas by Northern analysis but was not detected in tumor stromal cells or in other tissues including kidney, liver, skeletal muscle and brain. OC-116KDa mRNA was localized to multinucleated giant cells within the osteoclastoma tumor by in situ hybridization.

8579598|t|The ubiquitously expressed pICln protein forms homomeric complexes in vitro.
8579598|a|Endothelial cells contain a cell-volume sensitive chloride conductance with biophysical properties similar to those of a ubiquitously expressed chloride current that is activated by cell swelling. The latter current has been associated with the ICln protein (pICln) which may be the chloride channel itself or, alternatively, a channel regulator. We were therefore interested in whether pICln is involved in the endothelial volume-sensitive chloride current. As a first step, we have cloned human pICln and studied its expression at the protein level. Using a polyclonal antiserum raised against human pICln we found a widespread expression of pICln, both in endothelial cells and in other cell lines. A characteristic feature of pICln is its anomalous migration during denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We also demonstrate that bacterially expressed pICln forms homomeric complexes in vitro.

8581736|t|Cloning, sequencing and expression of a novel cDNA encoding human vacuolar ATPase (14-kDa subunit).
8581736|a|A cDNA encoding the 14-kDa subunit of vacuolar ATPase was cloned from human fetal brain. The sequence was composed of 680 nucleotides containing an open reading frame of 357 nucleotides. The deduced peptide sequence consisted of 119 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 13,369 Da and a pI of 5.19. Overall, this amino-acid sequence was respectively 69% and 70% identical to those of Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster 14-kDa subunits, although the two representatives of Class Insecta were remarkably similar to one another (91% identity). Three regions in particular (the N-terminal, amino acids 5-36; the middle, residues 58-68; and the C-terminal, residues 88-118) were highly conserved. Hence, we think that the 14-kDa subunits have evolved from the same ancestral gene, and that the three conserved regions are important for the structure and function of vacuolar ATPase. A single 0.8-kb band was detected in various human tissues by Northern blot analysis. Since the human 14-kDa subunit is expressed ubiquitously, it might be a housekeeping protein. A separate transcript found in the cDNA library lacked a 6-bp segment in the 5' non-coding region (nucleotides -40 to -35) and also carried a 23C to T (8Thr to Ile) point mutation in the coding region; these minor differences likely reflected normal polymorphism.

8600462|t|Molecular cloning and functional analysis of a human cDNA encoding an Escherichia coli AlkB homolog, a protein involved in DNA alkylation damage repair.
8600462|a|The Escherichia coli AlkB protein is involved in protecting cells against mutation and cell death induced specifically by SN2-type alkylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). A human cDNA encoding a polypeptide homologous to E.coli AlkB was discovered by searching a database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from high throughput cDNA sequencing. The full-length human AlkB homolog (hABH) cDNA clone contains a 924 bp open reading frame encoding a 34 kDa protein which is 52% similar and 23% identical to E.coli AlkB. The hABH gene, which maps to chromosome 14q24, was ubiquitously expressed in 16 human tissues examined. When hABH was expressed in E.coli alkB mutant cells partial rescue of the cells from MMS-induced cell death occurred. Under the conditions used expression of hABH in skin fibroblasts was not regulated by treatment with MMS. Our findings show that the AlkB protein is structurally and functionally conserved from bacteria to human, but its regulation may have diverged during evolution.

8612563|t|Cloning and characterization of human urocortin.
8612563|a|Urocortin, a new member of the CRF peptide family which also includes urotensin I and sauvagine, was recently cloned from the rat midbrain. The synthetic replicate of urocortin was found to bind with high affinity to type 1 and type 2 CRF receptors and, based upon its anatomic localization within the brain, was proposed to be a natural ligand for the type 2 CRF receptors. Using a genomic library, we have cloned the human counterpart of rat urocortin and localized it to human chromosome 2. Human and rat urocortin share 95% identity within the mature peptide region. Synthetic human urocortin binds with high affinity to CRF receptor types 1, 2 alpha, and 2 beta, stimulates cAMP accumulation from cells stably transfected with these receptors, and acts in vitro to release ACTH from dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells. In addition, the CRF-binding protein binds human urocortin with high affinity and can prevent urocortin-stimulated ACTH secretion in vitro. The inhibitory effect of the CRF-binding protein on human urocortin can be blocked by biologically inactive CRF fragments, such as CRF(9-33).

8632143|t|Molecular cloning, expression, and chromosomal localization of a human brain-specific Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter.
8632143|a|We describe the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a human brain Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate (P(i)) cotransporter (hBNPI). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of hBNPI reveal a protein of 560 amino acids with six to eight putative transmembrane segments. hBNPI shares a high degree of homology with other Na(+)-dependent inorganic P(i) cotransporters, including those found in rat brain and human and rabbit kidney. Expression of hBNPI in COS-1 cells results in Na(+)-dependent P(i) uptake. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that hBNPI mRNA is expressed predominantly in brain and most abundantly in neuron-enriched regions such as the amygdala and hippocampus. Moderate levels of expression are also observed in glia-enriched areas such as the corpus callosum, and low levels are observed in the substantia nigra, subthalamic nuclei, and thalamus. In situ hybridization histochemistry reveals relatively high levels of hBNPI mRNA in pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and in granule neurons of dentate gyrus. The level of hBNPI mRNA is quite low in fetal compared with adult human brain, suggesting developmental regulation of hBNPI gene expression. Southern analyses of nine eukaryotic genomic DNAs probed under stringent conditions with hBNPI cDNA revealed that the hBNPI gene is highly conserved during vertebrate evolution and that each gene is most likely present as a single copy. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we localized hBNPI to the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13) in close proximity to the late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease locus.

8643544|t|In its active form, the GTP-binding protein rab8 interacts with a stress-activated protein kinase.
8643544|a|Rab8 is a small GTP-binding protein that plays a role in vesicular transport from the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells (MDCK), and to the dendritic surface in hippocampal neurons. As is the case for most other rab proteins, the precise molecular interactions by which rab8 carries out its function remain to be elucidated. Here we report the identification and the complete cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of a murine rab8-interacting protein (rab8ip) that specifically interacts with rab8 in a GTP-dependent manner. Rab8ip displays 93% identity with the GC kinase, a serine/threonine protein kinase recently identified in human lymphoid tissue that is activated in the stress response. Like the GC kinase, rab8ip has protein kinase activity manifested by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the classical serine/threonine protein kinase substrates, myelin basic protein and casein. When coexpressed in transfected 293T cells, rab8 and the rab8ip/GC kinase formed a complex that could be recovered by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to rab8. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence analyses indicate that in MDCK cells endogenous rab8ip is present both in the cytosol and as a peripheral membrane protein concentrated in the Golgi region and basolateral plasma membrane domains, sites where rab8 itself is also located. In light of recent evidence that rab proteins may act by promoting the stabilization of SNARE complexes, the specific GTP-dependent association of rab8 with the rab8ip/GC kinase raises the possibility that rab-regulated protein phosphorylation is important for vesicle targeting or fusion. Moreover, the rab8ip/GC kinase may serve to modulate secretion in response to stress stimuli.

8643547|t|Distinct pharmacological properties and distribution in neurons and endocrine cells of two isoforms of the human vesicular monoamine transporter.
8643547|a|A second isoform of the human vesicular monoamine transporter (hVMAT) has been cloned from a pheochromocytoma cDNA library. The contribution of the two transporter isoforms to monoamine storage in human neuroendocrine tissues was examined with isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies against hVMAT1 and hVMAT2. Central, peripheral, and enteric neurons express only VMAT2. VMAT1 is expressed exclusively in neuroendocrine, including chromaffin and enterochromaffin, cells. VMAT1 and VMAT2 are coexpressed in all chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. VMAT2 alone is expressed in histamine-storing enterochromaffin-like cells of the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach. The transport characteristics and pharmacology of each VMAT isoform have been directly compared after expression in digitonin-permeabilized fibroblastic (CV-1) cells, providing information about substrate feature recognition by each transporter and the role of vesicular monoamine storage in the mechanism of action of psychopharmacologic and neurotoxic agents in human. Serotonin has a similar affinity for both transporters. Catecholamines exhibit a 3-fold higher affinity, and histamine exhibits a 30-fold higher affinity, for VMAT2. Reserpine and ketanserin are slightly more potent inhibitors of VMAT2-mediated transport than of VMAT1-mediated transport, whereas tetrabenazine binds to and inhibits only VMAT2. N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, phenylethylamine, amphetamine, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine are all more potent inhibitors of VMAT2 than of VMAT1, whereas fenfluramine is a more potent inhibitor of VMAT1-mediated monamine transport than of VMAT2-mediated monoamine transport. The unique distributions of hVMAT1 and hVMAT2 provide new markers for multiple neuroendocrine lineages, and examination of their transport properties provides mechanistic insights into the pharmacology and physiology of amine storage in cardiovascular, endocrine, and central nervous system function.

8643605|t|The adipocyte specific transcription factor C/EBPalpha modulates human ob gene expression.
8643605|a|The ob gene product, leptin, apparently exclusively expressed in adipose tissue, is a signaling factor regulating body weight homeostasis and energy balance. ob gene expression is increased in obese rodents and regulated by feeding, insulin, and glucocorticoids, which supports the concept that ob gene expression is under hormonal control, which is expected for a key factor controlling body weight homeostasis and energy balance. In humans, ob mRNA expression is increased in gross obesity; however, the effects of the above factors on human ob expression are unknown. We describe the structure of the human ob gene and initial functional analysis of its promoter. The human ob gene's three exons cover approximately 15 kb of genomic DNA. The entire coding region is contained in exons 2 and 3, which are separated by a 2-kb intron. The first small 30-bp untranslated exon is located >10.5 kb upstream of the initiator ATG codon. Three kilobases of DNA upstream of the transcription start site has been cloned and characterized. Only 217 bp of 5' sequence are required for basal adipose tissue-specific expression of the ob gene as well as enhanced expression by C/EBPalpha. Mutation of the single C/EBPalpha site in this region abolished inducibility of the promoter by C/EBPalpha in cotransfection assays. The gene structure will facilitate our analysis of ob mutations in human obesity, whereas knowledge of sequence elements and factors regulating ob gene expression should be of major importance in the prevention and treatment of obesity.

8643607|t|Cloning and characterization of a specific coactivator, ARA70, for the androgen receptor in human prostate cells.
8643607|a|The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily that plays an important role in male sexual differentiation and prostate cell proliferation. Mutations or abnormal expression of AR in prostate cancer can play a key role in the process that changes prostate cancer from androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent stage. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we were able to isolate a ligand-dependent AR-associated protein (ARA70), which functions as an activator to enhance AR transcriptional activity 10-fold in the presence of 10(-10) M dihydrotestosterone or 10(-9) M testosterone, but not 10(-6) M hydroxyflutamide in human prostate cancer DU145 cells. Our data further indicated that ARA70 Will only slightly induce the transcriptional activity of other steroid receptors such as estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and progesterone receptor in DU145 cells. Together, these data suggest that AR may need a specific coactivator(s) such as ARA70 for optimal androgen activity.

8643684|t|Intergenic splicing of MDS1 and EVI1 occurs in normal tissues as well as in myeloid leukemia and produces a new member of the PR domain family.
8643684|a|The EVI1 gene, located at chromosome band 3q26, is overexpressed in some myeloid leukemia patients with breakpoints either 5' of the gene in the t(3;3)(q21;q26) or 3' of the gene in the inv(3)(q21q26). EVI1 is also expressed as part of a fusion transcript with the transcription factor AML1 in the t(3;21)(q26;q22), associated with myeloid leukemia. In cells with t(3;21), additional fusion transcripts are AML1-MDS1 and AML1-MDS1-EVI1. MDS1 is located at 3q26 170-400 kb upstream (telomeric) of EVI1 in the chromosomal region in which some of the breakpoints 5' of EVI1 have been mapped. MDS1 has been identified as a single gene as well as a previously unreported exon(s) of EVI1 We have analyzed the relationship between MDS1 and EVI1 to determine whether they are two separate genes. In this report, we present evidence indicating that MDS1 exists in normal tissues both as a unique transcript and as a normal fusion transcript with EVI1, with an additional 188 codons at the 5' end of the previously reported EVI1 open reading frame. This additional region has about 40% homology at the amino acid level with the PR domain of the retinoblastoma-interacting zinc-finger protein RIZ. These results are important in view of the fact that EVI1 and MDS1 are involved in leukemia associated with chromosomal translocation breakpoints in the region between these genes.

8647900|t|MDC9, a widely expressed cellular disintegrin containing cytoplasmic SH3 ligand domains.
8647900|a|Cellular disintegrins are a family of proteins that are related to snake venom integrin ligands and metalloproteases. We have cloned and sequenced the mouse and human homologue of a widely expressed cellular disintegrin, which we have termed MDC9 (for metalloprotease/disintegrin/cysteine-rich protein 9). The deduced mouse and human protein sequences are 82% identical. MDC9 contains several distinct protein domains: a signal sequence is followed by a prodomain and a domain with sequence similarity to snake venom metalloproteases, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region, an EGF repeat, a membrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail of MDC9 has two proline-rich sequences which can bind the SH3 domain of Src, and may therefore function as SH3 ligand domains. Western blot analysis shows that MDC9 is an approximately 84-kD glycoprotein in all mouse tissues examined, and in NIH 3T3 fibroblast and C2C12 myoblast mouse cell lines. MDC9 can be both cell surface biotinylated and 125I-labeled in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, indicating that the protein is present on the plasma membrane. Expression of MDC9 in COS-7 cells yields an 84-kD protein, and immunofluorescence analysis of COS-7 cells expressing MDC9 shows a staining pattern that is consistent with a plasma membrane localization. The apparent molecular mass of 84 kD suggests that MDC9 contains a membrane-anchored metalloprotease and disintegrin domain. We propose that MDC9 might function as a membrane-anchored integrin ligand or metalloprotease, or that MDC9 may combine both activities in one protein.

8651283|t|A GLRA1 null mutation in recessive hyperekplexia challenges the functional role of glycine receptors.
8651283|a|Dominant missense mutations in the human glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha 1 subunit gene (GLRA1) give rise to hereditary hyperekplexia. These mutations impair agonist affinities and change conductance states of expressed mutant channels, resulting in a partial loss of function. In a recessive case of hyperekplexia, we found a deletion of exons 1-6 of the GLRA1 gene. Born to consanguineous parents, the affected child is homozygous for this GLRA1(null) allele consistent with a complete loss of gene function. The child displayed exaggerated startle responses and pronounced head-retraction jerks reflecting a disinhibition of vestigial brain-stem reflexes. In contrast, proprio- and exteroceptive inhibition of muscle activity previously correlated to glycinergic mechanisms were not affected. This case demonstrates that, in contrast to the lethal effect of a null allele in the recessive mouse mutant oscillator (Glra1 spd-ot), the loss of the GlyR alpha 1 subunit is effectively compensated in man.

8663110|t|Induction of apoptosis by Apo-2 ligand, a new member of the tumor necrosis factor cytokine family.
8663110|a|Cytokines in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family regulate development and function of the immune system. We have isolated a new member of this family, designated Apo-2 ligand (Apo-2L), via an expressed sequence tag. Apo-2L is a 281-amino acid protein, related most closely to Fas/Apo-1 ligand. Transfected Apo-2L is expressed at the cell surface with its C terminus exposed, indicating a type II transmembrane protein topology. Like Fas/Apo-1 ligand and TNF, the C-terminal extracellular region of Apo-2L (amino acids 114-281) exhibits a homotrimeric subunit structure. Soluble Apo-2L induces extensive apoptosis in lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid tumor cell lines. The effect of Apo-2L is not inhibited by soluble Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors; moreover, expression of human Fas/Apo-1 in mouse fibroblasts, which confers sensitivity to induction of apoptosis by agonistic anti-Fas/Apo-1 antibody, does not confer sensitivity to Apo-2L. Hence, Apo-2L acts via a receptor which is distinct from Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors. These results suggest that, along with other family members such as Fas/Apo-1 ligand and TNF, Apo-2L may serve as an extracellular signal that triggers programmed cell death.

8663203|t|cDNA cloning and expression of a novel human UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine. Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, GalNAc-t3.
8663203|a|The glycosylation of serine and threonine residues during mucin-type O-linked protein glycosylation is carried out by a family of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-transferase). Previously two members, GalNAc-T1 and -T2, have been isolated and the genes cloned and characterized. Here we report the cDNA cloning and expression of a novel GalNAc-transferase termed GalNAc-T3. The gene was isolated and cloned based on the identification of a GalNAc-transferase motif (61 amino acids) that is shared between GalNAc-T1 and -T2 as well as a homologous Caenorhabditis elegans gene. The cDNA sequence has a 633-amino acid coding region indicating a protein of 72.5 kDa with a type II domain structure. The overall amino acid sequence similarity with GalNAc-T1 and -T2 is approximately 45%; 12 cysteine residues that are shared between GalNAc-T1 and -T2 are also found in GalNAc-T3. GalNAc-T3 was expressed as a soluble protein without the hydrophobic transmembrane domain in insect cells using a Baculo-virus vector, and the expressed GalNAc-transferase activity showed substrate specificity different from that previously reported for GalNAc-T1 and -T2. Northern analysis of human organs revealed a very restricted expression pattern of GalNAc-T3.

8663286|t|Characterization of multiple mRNAs that encode mammalian translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5).
8663286|a|Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5) interacts with the 40 S initiation complex (40S.mRNA.MettRNAf.eIF-2.GTP) to promote the hydrolysis of bound GTP with the concomitant joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 40 S initiation complex to form a functional 80 S initiation complex. In this paper, the multiple mRNAs that encode mammalian eIF-5 have been characterized. In rat tissues, three major eIF-5 mRNAs of 3.5, 2.8, and 2.2 kilobases in length are detected. All major eIF-5 mRNAs are initiated from a single transcription initiation site, contain identical 5'-untranslated and coding regions, but differ from one another only in the length of their 3'-untranslated regions. The different lengths of the 3'-untranslated region of eIF-5 mRNAs are generated by the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. Additionally, we demonstrate tissue-specific variations in eIF-5 mRNA expression as well as preference for polyadenylation sites. These results should lead to increased understanding of the regulation of eIF-5 gene expression.

8663294|t|ICE-LAP6, a novel member of the ICE/Ced-3 gene family, is activated by the cytotoxic T cell protease granzyme B.
8663294|a|Members of the ICE/Ced-3 gene family are likely effector components of the cell death machinery. Here, we characterize a novel member of this family designated ICE-LAP6. By phylogenetic analysis, ICE-LAP6 is classified into the Ced-3 subfamily which includes Ced-3, Yama/CPP32/apopain, Mch2, and ICE-LAP3/Mch3/CMH-1. Interestingly, ICE-LAP6 contains an active site QACGG pentapeptide, rather than the QACRG pentapeptide shared by other family members. Overexpression of ICE-LAP6 induces apoptosis in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells. More importantly, ICE-LAP6 is proteolytically processed into an active cysteine protease by granzyme B, an important component of cytotoxic T cell-mediated apoptosis. Once activated, ICE-LAP6 is able to cleave the death substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase into signature apoptotic fragments.

8679694|t|Molecular cloning, expression and function of the murine CB2 peripheral cannabinoid receptor.
8679694|a|We have cloned the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, mCB2, from a mouse splenocyte cDNA library. The 3.7 kb sequence contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 347 residues sharing 82% overall identity with the only other known peripheral receptor, human CB2 (hCB2) and shorter than hCB2 by 13 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. Binding experiments with membranes from COS-3 cells transiently expressing mCB2 showed that the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55212-2 had a 6-fold lower affinity for mCB2 than for hCB2, whereas both receptors showed similar affinities for the agonists CP 55,940, delta(9)-THC and anandamide and almost no affinity for the central receptor- (CB1) specific antagonist SR 141716A. Both hCB2 and mCB2 mediate agonist-stimulated inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production in CHO cell lines permanently expressing the receptors. SR 141716A failed to antagonize this activity in either cell line, confirming its specificity for CB1.

8717357|t|The human glycine receptor beta subunit: primary structure, functional characterisation and chromosomal localisation of the human and murine genes.
8717357|a|The inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) is a pentameric receptor comprised of alpha and beta subunits, of which the beta subunit has not been characterised in humans. A 2106 bp cDNA, isolated from a human hippocampal cDNA library, contained an open reading frame of 497 amino acids which encodes the beta subunit of the human GlyR. The mature human GlyR beta polypeptide displays 99% amino acid identity with the rat GlyR beta subunit and 48% identity with the human GlyR alpha 1 subunit. Neither [3H]strychnine binding nor glycine-gated currents were detected when the human GlyR beta subunit cDNA was expressed in the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line. However, co-expression of the beta subunit cDNA with the alpha 1 subunit cDNA resulted in expression of functional GlyRs which showed a 4-fold reduction in the EC50 values when compared to alpha 1 homomeric GlyRs. Glycine-gated currents of alpha 1/beta GlyRs were 17-fold less sensitive than homomeric alpha 1 GlyRs to the antagonists picrotoxin, picrotoxinin and picrotin, providing clear evidence that heteromeric alpha 1/beta GlyRs were expressed. The beta subunit appears to play a structural rather than ligand binding role in GlyR function. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation was used to localise the gene encoding the human GlyR beta subunit (GLRB) to chromosome 4q32, a position syntenic with mouse chromosome 3. In situ hybridisation using the human GlyR beta subunit cDNA showed that the murine GlyR beta subunit gene (Glrb) maps to the spastic (spa) locus on mouse chromosome 3 at bands E3-F1. This is consistent with the recent finding that a mutation in the murine GlyR beta subunit causes the spa phenotype. It also raises the possibility that mutations in the human beta subunit gene may cause inherited disorders of the startle response.

8751386|t|Coding sequence and chromosome mapping of the human gene (CDC46) for replication protein hCdc46/Mcm5.
8751386|a|We have isolated the complete cDNA sequence encoding the human homolog of the yeast replication protein Cdc46/Mcm5. The cDNA was used as a probe for chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which localized the human Cdc46 gene (CDC46) to chromosome region 22q13.1-->q13.2. This is the fourth human Mcm gene whose chromosome region has been determined, and it is now apparent that human Mcm genes are widely distributed in the genome. As deduced from the cDNA sequence, human protein hCdc46 is composed of 734 amino acids and contains a central region that is almost 80% identical with the yeast protein. Immunoprecipitation experiments with hCdc46-specific antibodies confirm that essentially all nuclear hCdc46 proteins form a stable dimeric complex with protein P1Mcm3.

8755601|t|kappa opioid receptors in human microglia downregulate human immunodeficiency virus 1 expression.
8755601|a|Microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the brain, play an important role in the neuropathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and recent studies suggest that opioid peptides regulate the function of macrophages from somatic tissues. We report herein the presence of kappa opioid receptors (KORs) in human fetal microglia and inhibition of HIV-1 expression in acutely infected microglial cell cultures treated with KOR ligands. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analyses, we found that mRNA for the KOR was constitutively expressed in microglia and determined that the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame was identical to that of the human brain KOR gene. The expression of KOR in microglial cells was confirmed by membrane binding of [3H]U69,593, a kappa-selective ligand, and by indirect immunofluorescence. Treatment of microglial cell cultures with U50,488 or U69,593 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of expression of the monocytotropic HIV-1 SF162 strain. This antiviral effect of the kappa ligands was blocked by the specific KOR antagonist, nor-binaltrophimine. These findings suggest that kappa opioid agonists have immunomodulatory activity in the brain, and that these compounds could have potential in the treatment of HIV-1-associated encephalopathy.

8774743|t|cDNA cloning and functional analysis of the p97 subunit of the 26S proteasome, a polypeptide identical to the type-1 tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated protein-2/55.11.
8774743|a|Molecular cloning of cDNA for a new regulatory subunit, designated p97, of the human 26S proteasome showed that the polypeptide consists of 908 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 100184 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.94. Computer analysis showed that p97 is very similar to type-1 tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-receptor-associated protein (TRAP)-2 and 55.11, both of which were identified recently as binding proteins of the cytoplasmic domain of type-1 TNF receptor by yeast two-hybrid screening. This finding suggests that the 26S proteasome might serve as a mediator molecule in the TNF signaling pathway in cells. Computer-assisted similarity analysis also revealed the high sequence similarity of p97 with a yeast protein whose function is yet unknown, the gene for which is here termed NAS1 (non-ATPase subunit 1). Disruption of NAS1 resulted in several phenotypes, including lethality and temperature-sensitive growth, depending on the genetic background of the cells used. The human p97 cDNA suppressed the growth defect of nas1 disruptant cells, when expressed from single-copy or multi-copy vectors, indicating that p97 is functionally equivalent to yeast Nas1p. Culturing of the temperature-sensitive nas1 cells at the restrictive temperature promoted the accumulation polyubiquitinated cellular proteins, implying that the 26S proteasome requires a functional Nas1p subunit for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. These results indicate that p97/Nas1p plays an important regulatory role in the function of the 26S proteasome.

8774881|t|Receptor-associated Mad homologues synergize as effectors of the TGF-beta response.
8774881|a|Transforming growth factor-beta TGF-beta is the prototype for a family of extracellular proteins that affect cell proliferation and tissue differentiation. TGF-beta-related factors, including BMP-2/4, Dpp and activin, act through two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors which can form a heteromeric complex. However, the mechanism of signal transduction by these receptors is largely unknown. In Drosophila, Mad is required for signalling by Dpp. We have isolated complementary DNAs for four human Mad homologues, one of which, hMAD-4, is identical to DPC-4, a candidate tumour suppressor. hMAD-3 and -4 synergized to induce strong ligand-independent TGF-beta-like responses. When truncated at their carboxy termini, hMAD-3 and -4 act as dominant-negative inhibitors of the normal TGF-beta response. The activity of hMAD-3 and -4 was regulated by the TGF-beta receptors, and hMAD-3 but not hMAD-4 was phosphorylated and associated with the ligand-bound receptor complex. These results define hMAD-3 and -4 as effectors of the TGF-beta response and demonstrate a function for DPCA-4/hMAD-4 as a tumour suppressor.

8779720|t|The C5a chemoattractant receptor mediates mucosal defence to infection.
8779720|a|A family of G-protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors is known to mediate the transport and activation of neutrophils and macrophages This family includes receptors for chemokines, such as interleukin-8, bacterial formylated peptides, platelet-activating factor, leukotriene B4, and the complement anaphylatoxins. The apparent redundancy of these receptors suggests that they have an important underlying role in host defence. To isolate the contribution of particular molecules, we disrupted a gene that encodes a single chemoattractant receptor. Here we show that mice deficient in the chemoattractant C5a receptor, in comparison to their wild-type littermates, were unable to clear intrapulmonary-instilled Pseudomonas aeruginosa, despite a marked increase in neutrophil influx, and succumbed to pneumonia. These C5a-receptor-deficient mice challenged with sublethal inocula of Pseudomonas become superinfected with secondary bacterial strains. We conclude that the C5a receptor has a non-redundant function, and is required for mucosal host defence in the lung.

8798744|t|Cell-cell adhesion mediated by binding of membrane-anchored ligand LERK-2 to the EPH-related receptor human embryonal kinase 2 promotes tyrosine kinase activity.
8798744|a|Human embryonal kinase 2 (HEK2) is a protein-tyrosine kinase that is a member of the EPH family of receptors. Transcripts for HEK2 have a wide tissue distribution. Recently, a still growing family of ligands, which we have named LERKs, for ligands of the eph-related kinases, has been isolated. In order to analyze functional effects between the LERKs and the HEK2 receptor, we expressed HEK2 cDNA in an interleukin-3-dependent progenitor cell line 32D that grows as single cells in culture. Within the group of LERKs, LERK-2 and -5 were shown to bind to HEK2. Membrane-bound and soluble forms of LERK-2 were demonstrated to signal through HEK2 as judged by receptor phosphorylation. Coincubation of HEK2 and LERK-2 expressing cells induced cell-cell adhesion and formation of cell aggregates. This interaction could be inhibited by preincubation of HEK2 expressing cells with soluble LERK-2. Coexpression of HEK2 and LERK-2 in 32D cells showed reduced kinase activity and autophosphorylation of HEK2 compared with the juxtacrine stimulation, which seems to be due to a reduced sensitivity of the receptor.

8831703|t|Expression of the receptor protein tyrosine kinase myk-1/htk in normal and malignant mammary epithelium.
8831703|a|We have recently reported the molecular characterization of a novel murine receptor PTK (myk-1), belonging to the eph-related family, whose expression was differentially regulated during mammary gland development and elevated in invasive mouse mammary tumours. In this communication we have investigated the cellular origin of myk-1 expression by in situ hybridisation and RNase protection. Murine antisense myk-1 probe specifically recognised ductal and alveolar epithelium in the resting mouse mammary gland. In normal human breast, the expression of htk, the human homologue, was also confined to the secretory luminal epithelial cells. RNase protection analysis of enriched luminal and myoepithelial cells prepared from human reduction mammoplasty tissue confirmed the luminal specificity. Elevated expression of htk was found in several human breast carcinoma cell lines as well as in primary, high grade, infiltrating, ductal carcinomas of the breast. The specific epithelial expression of the myk-1/htk receptor PTK suggest a specialised role of this eph-related PTK in the differentiation and/or maintenance of secretory epithelium in the adult.

8844170|t|Cloning and characterization of a novel human clathrin heavy chain gene (CLTCL).
8844170|a|An exon representing a novel clathrin heavy chain gene (CLTCL) was isolated during gene identification studies and transcription mapping of human chromosome 22. Isolation and sequencing of cDNA clones corresponding to this exon revealed extensive similarity of the predicted amino acid sequence of this gene product to those of clathrin heavy chain genes of other species. Northern blot analysis has revealed an apparent developmental expression pattern of an approximately 6-kb mRNA. The gene appears to be expressed ubiquitously in the limited number of fetal tissues that were tested, but is selectively expressed in certain adult tissues, particularly in skeletal muscle. In addition, alternative splicing of an exon was observed near the carboxyl terminus of the predicted gene product. Its location overlaps the domain putatively involved in clathrin light chain binding and is adjacent to the heavy chain self-assembly (or trimerization) region, suggesting that alternative splicing may be involved in regulating one or both of these interactions. The expression pattern of this gene, in addition to its potential role in receptor-mediated endocytosis and signal transduction, suggests that it may be important in some developmental processes. The location of CLTCL on human chromosome 22 near the region commonly deleted in DiGeorge and other apparent haploinsufficiency syndromes warrants further investigation into its relationship with these developmental disorders.

8867793|t|Molecular cloning of two rat Na+/Pi cotransporters: evidence for differential tissue expression of transcripts.
8867793|a|Recently, Na+/Pi cotransport activity has been demonstrated in rat liver hepatocytes. Here, we report the isolation of two Na+/Pi cotransporter cDNAs (RNaPi-1a and RNaPi-1b) from a rat liver cDNA library. The two cDNAs have the same coding but different 5'-untranslated regions. The rat cDNAs encode a polypeptide of 465 amino acids, having 62% and 66% identity with the rabbit NaPi-1 and human kidney Na+/Pi cotransporter, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that a RNaPi-1a--specific probe detected two major transcripts (2.3 and 1.8 kb), whereas a RNaPi-1b--specific probe hybridized with one transcript (1.8 kb) in rat kidney, liver, and hepatocytes in primary culture. Rat liver expressed much higher levels of RNaPi-1a than RNaPi-1b, whereas the converse was true for rat kidney. Low levels of RNaPi-1 mRNAs were also detected in rat heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. These findings indicate that there are at least two isoforms of RNaPi-1 transcripts expressed in liver and kidney and that the levels of expression of the RNaPi-1a and RNaPi-1b may be controlled by tissue-specific factors.

8890164|t|Association of inhibitory tyrosine protein kinase p50csk with protein tyrosine phosphatase PEP in T cells and other hemopoietic cells.
8890164|a|p50csk is a tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) that represses the activity of Src family TPKs. We previously showed that Csk is a potent negative regulator of antigen receptor signaling in T lymphocytes and that its Src homology (SH) 3 and SH2 domains are required to inhibit these signals. To test the idea that the Csk SH3 and SH2 domains mediate interactions with other cellular proteins, we attempted to identify Csk-associated polypeptides using the yeast two-hybrid system. The results of our experiments demonstrated that Csk physically associates with PEP, a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) expressed in hemopoietic cells. Further analyses revealed that this interaction was mediated by the Csk SH3 domain and by a proline-rich region (PPPLPERTP) in the non-catalytic C-terminal portion of PEP. The association between Csk and PEP was documented in transiently transfected Cos-1 cells and in a variety of cells of hemopoietic lineages, including T cells. Additional analyses demonstrated that the association between Csk and PEP is highly specific. Together, these data indicated that PEP may be an effector and/or a regulator of p50csk in T cells and other hemopoietic cells. Moreover, they allowed the identification of PEP as the first known ligand for the Csk SH3 domain.

8912632|t|cDNA cloning of human allograft inflammatory factor-1: tissue distribution, cytokine induction, and mRNA expression in injured rat carotid arteries.
8912632|a|We have previously identified a partial cDNA fragment obtained from rat carotid arteries subject to balloon angioplasty which is increased in response to vascular injury. We now report the isolation and characterization of a full length human clone which is 98% homologous at the amino acid level to the rat. Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF-1), a gene previously reported to be expressed in rat IFN gamma-activated macrophages. This transcript is expressed in low levels in undamaged, and increases 1 day and 3 days, and declines 7 days post balloon angioplasty. This human AIF-1 homologue is inducible in serum and cytokine-stimulated human smooth muscle cells. Interestingly, human tissue distribution indicates a constitutive expression in lymphoid tissue which can be augmented by mitogens. In summary, human AIF represents a cytokine inducible, tissue-specific, and highly conserved transcript transiently expressed in response to vascular trauma.

8990205|t|Functional expression of a novel human neurokinin-3 receptor homolog that binds [3H]senktide and [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B, and is responsive to tachykinin peptide agonists.
8990205|a|In 1992, Xie et al. identified a cDNA sequence in the expression cloning search for the kappa opioid receptor. When the cDNA was expressed in Cos-7 cells, binding of opioid compounds was observed to be of low affinity and without kappa, mu, or delta selectivity [Xie, G.-X., Miyajima, A. and Goldstein, A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 4124-4128]. This cDNA was highly homologous to the human neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptor sequence, and displayed lower homology to NK-1 and NK-2 sequences. This sequence was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express neurokinin receptors naturally, and ligand binding and second messenger characteristics were compared with a human NK-3 receptor. The NK-3 receptor homolog bound [3H] senktide with a Kd of 39 nM, similar to that of the NK-3 receptor. The rank order of tachykinin peptides competing for [3H]senktide binding at the NK-3 receptor homolog was [MePhe7]neurokinin B > senktide > substance P = neurokinin A > neurokinin B. This cell line also bound [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B; however, neurokinin B was an effective competitor. Tachykinin peptides stimulated both inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and arachidonic acid release at NK-3 and NK-3 receptor homolog cell lines, with similar rank orders of potency of [MePhe7] neurokinin B = neurokinin B = senktide > NKA = substance P. These results indicate that expression of the NK-3 receptor homolog cDNA in the Chinese hamster ovary cell system induces the expression of a receptor site with many similarities but certain key differences from that of the human NK-3 receptor. The results are discussed with reference to the existence of a novel human tachykinin receptor.

9022669|t|Molecular cloning and characterization of a transcription factor for the C-type natriuretic peptide gene promoter.
9022669|a|Our previous studies on the promoter function of the human C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) gene revealed the existence of two GC-rich cis elements essential for gene transcription in rat pituitary-derived GH3 cells. To isolate transcription factors that bind to those GC-rich elements, we screened a lambda ZAP cDNA library derived from GH3 cells by Southwestern screening. Several positive clones with specific binding abilities were obtained, and one was identical as TSC-22, a speculated transcriptional modulator stimulated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) of unknown function. TSC-22 significantly enhanced CNP promoter activity in GH3 cells. We further cloned a 1.8-kb full-length human TSC-22 cDNA from a fetal kidney cDNA library by a combination of polymerase chain reaction and the rapid amplification of the cDNA ends technique. In adults, human TSC-22 mRNA was highly expressed in brain, lung and heart. TSC-22 gene expression in GH3 and human aortic endothelial cells was stimulated by cytokines including TGF-beta, in correlation with the CNP mRNA increase. These results suggest that TSC-22 is a transcriptional regulator of the CNP gene and transmits signals from cytokines, such as TGF-beta, to CNP gene expression.

9027507|t|Cloning and characterization of Rep-8 (D8S2298E) in the human chromosome 8p11.2-p12.
9027507|a|A novel human gene referred to as the Rep-8 gene (D8S2298E) was cloned by a combination of exon trapping, thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR, and screening of a cDNA library. It is located in human chromosome 8p11.2-p12. The gene consists of eight exons and spans about 20 kb between the glutathione S-reductase and the protein phosphatase 2A beta subunit genes. The full-length Rep-8 gene contains 1483 nucleotides and codes for a protein of 270 amino acids. Southern blot experiments showed that the Rep-8 gene exists as a single copy per haploid. With a zoo blot analysis, human Rep-8 DNA hybridized strongly with the monkey DNA, but only weakly with the DNAs of species other than Homo sapiens. Northern blot analysis showed that it is expressed abundantly in the testis and ovary, suggesting that the Rep-8 gene product may play a role in reproduction.

9027509|t|Sequence analysis of two genomic regions containing the KIT and the FMS receptor tyrosine kinase genes.
9027509|a|The KIT and FMS tyrosine kinase receptors, which are implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation, stem through duplications from a common ancestor. We have conducted a detailed structural analysis of the two loci containing the KIT and FMS genes. The sequence of the approximately 90-kb KIT locus reveals the position and size of the 21 introns and of the 5' regulatory region of the KIT gene. The introns and the 3'-untranslated parts of KIT and FMS have been analyzed in parallel. Comparison of the two sequences shows that, while introns of both genes have extensively diverged in size and sequence, this divergence is, at least in part, due to intron expansion through internal duplications, as suggested by the discrete extant analogies. Repetitive elements as well as exon predictions obtained using the GRAIL and GENEFINDER programs are described in detail. These programs led us to identify a novel gene, designated SMF, immediately downstream of FMS, in the opposite orientation. This finding emphasizes the gene-rich characteristic of this genomic region.

9027582|t|Isolation, characterization, and chromosomal mapping of a novel cDNA clone encoding human selenium binding protein.
9027582|a|We have isolated the full-length human 56 kDa selenium binding protein (hSP56) cDNA clone, which is the human homolog of mouse 56 kDa selenium binding protein. The cDNA is 1,668 bp long and has an open reading frame encoding 472 amino acids. The calculated molecular weight is 52.25 kDa and the estimated isoelectric point is 6.13. Using Northern blot hybridization, we found that this 56 kDa selenium binding protein is expressed in mouse heart with an intermediate level between those found in liver/lung/kidney and intestine. We have also successfully expressed hSP56 in Escherichia coli using the expression vector-pAED4. The hSP56 gene is located at human chromosome 1q21-22).

9092543|t|Cloning and chromosomal location of a novel member of the myotonic dystrophy family of protein kinases.
9092543|a|We have cloned a novel serine/threonine protein kinase (PK428) which is highly related (65%) within the kinase domain to the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DM-PK), as well as the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (33%). Northern blots demonstrate that PK428 mRNA is distributed widely among tissues and is expressed at the highest levels in pancreas, heart, and skeletal muscle, with lower levels in liver and lung. Two PK428 mRNAs 10 and 3.8 kilobase pairs in size are seen in a number of cell lines, including hematopoietic and breast cancer cells. An antibody generated to a glutathione S-transferase-PK428 fusion protein detects a 65-kDa protein in these cell lines, and a similarly sized protein when the cloned cDNA is transiently expressed in Cos 7 cells. Immunoprecipitation of the transiently expressed PK428 protein and incubation with [gamma-32P]ATP demonstrate that it is capable of autophosphorylation. In addition, immunoprecipitates of the PK428 protein kinase also phosphorylated histone H1 and a peptide encoding a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase substrate. The gene corresponding to the 3.8-kb PK428 mRNA, and its corresponding 65-kDa protein, was isolated by polymerase chain reaction screening of a P1 phage human genomic library. Using this P1 phage clone as a probe, the PK428 gene was located on 1q41-42, a possible location for a human senescence gene, a gene associated with Rippling muscle disease, as well as a region associated with genetically acquired mental retardation.

9092545|t|Isolation and characterization of a structural homologue of human PRK2 from rat liver. Distinguishing substrate and lipid activator specificities.
9092545|a|A homologue of human protein kinase C (PKC)-related kinase-2, PRK2, which had previously escaped identification in normal mammalian tissues, was isolated from rat liver as the protease-activated kinase (PAK) originally named PAK-2. The 130-kDa cytosolic enzyme was purified to homogeneity and shown by tryptic peptide and reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-amplified rat cDNA sequence analyses to be structurally related to the 116-kDa rat hepatic PAK-1/protein kinase N (PKN) and, even more closely (95% sequence identity) to the 130-kDa human PKC-related kinase, PRK2. Rat myeloma RNA was used as the RT-PCR template because of its relative abundance in PAK-2/PRK2 mRNA compared with liver and other rat tissues. The catalytic properties of PAK-2/PRK2 in many respects resembled those of hepatic PAK-1/PKN, but were distinguished by more favorable kinetics with several peptide substrates, and greater sensitivity to PKC pseudosubstrate and polybasic amino acid inhibitors. PAK-2/PRK2 was also activated by lipids, particularly cardiolipin and to a lesser extent by other acidic phospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids. Cardiolipin activation was most evident with autophosphorylation and histone H2B phosphorylation, but only marginally evident with the favored ribosomal S6-(229-239) peptide substrate for the protease-activated kinase activity. It was concluded that PAK-2 is the rat homologue of human PRK2, with biochemical properties distinct from although overlapping those of the PAK-1/PKN/PRK1 isoform.

9092576|t|Human dipeptidyl-peptidase I. Gene characterization, localization, and expression.
9092576|a|Dipeptidyl-peptidase I, a lysosomal cysteine proteinase, is important in intracellular degradation of proteins and appears to be a central coordinator for activation of many serine proteinases in immune/inflammatory cells. Little is known about the molecular genetics of the enzyme. In the present investigation the gene for dipeptidyl-peptidase I was cloned and characterized. The gene spans approximately 3.5 kilobases and consists of two exons and one intron. The genomic organization is distinct from the complex structures of the other members of the papain-type cysteine proteinase family. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the gene was mapped to chromosomal region 11q14.1-q14.3. Analysis of the sequenced 5'-flanking region revealed no classical TATA or CCAAT box in the GC-rich region upstream of cap site. A number of possible regulatory elements that could account for tissue-specific expression were identified. Northern analyses demonstrated that the dipeptidyl-peptidase I message is expressed at high levels in lung, kidney, and placenta, at moderate to low levels in many organs, and at barely detectable levels in the brain, suggesting tissue-specific regulation. Among immune/inflammatory cells, the message is expressed at high levels in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and alveolar macrophages and their precursor cells. Treatment of lymphocytes with interleukin-2 resulted in a significant increase in dipeptidyl-peptidase I mRNA levels, suggesting that this gene is subjected to transcriptional regulation. The results provide initial insights into the molecular basis for the regulation of human dipeptidyl-peptidase I.

9108485|t|Osteoprotegerin: a novel secreted protein involved in the regulation of bone density.
9108485|a|A novel secreted glycoprotein that regulates bone resorption has been identified. The protein, termed Osteoprotegerin (OPG), is a novel member of the TNF receptor superfamily. In vivo, hepatic expression of OPG in transgenic mice results in a profound yet nonlethal osteopetrosis, coincident with a decrease in later stages of osteoclast differentiation. These same effects are observed upon administration of recombinant OPG into normal mice. In vitro, osteoclast differentiation from precursor cells is blocked in a dose-dependent manner by recombinant OPG. Furthermore, OPG blocks ovariectomy-associated bone loss in rats. These data show that OPG can act as a soluble factor in the regulation of bone mass and imply a utility for OPG in the treatment of osteoporosis associated with increased osteoclast activity.

9116026|t|Isolation of a novel human cDNA (rhoHP1) homologous to rho genes.
9116026|a|A novel full-length cDNA showing homology with rho genes was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library. Sequencing of a total of 1086 nucleotides of this clone revealed an open reading frame of 630 nucleotides (210 amino acids). In view of its degree of homology to members of the Rho family of molecules (50-54% identical amino acids, 60-63% identical nucleotides within the coding region), the predicted product was designated RhoHP1(Rho-related protein HP1). Northern analysis indicated that a message about 1.2-kb long is expressed in human heart, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas and, with weaker intensity, in several other tissues.

9135156|t|I kappa B epsilon, a novel member of the I kappa B family, controls RelA and cRel NF-kappa B activity.
9135156|a|We have isolated a human cDNA which encodes a novel I kappa B family member using a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins able to interact with the p52 subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappa B. The protein is found in many cell types and its expression is up-regulated following NF-kappa B activation and during myelopoiesis. Consistent with its proposed role as an I kappa B molecule, I kappa B-epsilon is able to inhibit NF-kappa B-directed transactivation via cytoplasmic retention of rel proteins. I kappa B-epsilon translation initiates from an internal ATG codon to give rise to a protein of 45 kDa, which exists as multiple phosphorylated isoforms in resting cells. Unlike the other inhibitors, it is found almost exclusively in complexes containing RelA and/or cRel. Upon activation, I kappa B-epsilon protein is degraded with slow kinetics by a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Similarly to I kappa B-alpha and I kappa B, I kappa B-epsilon contains multiple ankyrin repeats and two conserved serines which are necessary for signal-induced degradation of the molecule. A unique lysine residue located N-terminal of the serines appears to be not strictly required for degradation. Unlike I kappa B- alpha and I kappa B-beta, I kappa B-epsilon does not contain a C-terminal PEST-like sequence. I kappa B-epsilon would, therefore, appear to regulate a late, transient activation of a subset of genes, regulated by RelA/cRel NF-kappa B complexes, distinct from those regulated by other I kappa B proteins.

9159129|t|Characterization of VPS41, a gene required for vacuolar trafficking and high-affinity iron transport in yeast.
9159129|a|Mutations in the yeast gene VPS41 give rise to poor growth on low iron medium, severe alterations in vacuolar morphology, and cause the missorting of membranous and soluble vacuolar proteins. Our studies predict that VPS41 encodes a hydrophilic protein of 992 amino acids that contains no obvious signal sequence or hydrophobic domains. The deduced Vps41p sequence contains a domain rich in glutamic and aspartic residues, as well as a domain with resemblance to a region of clathrin heavy chain. We have also identified and sequenced putative VPS41 homologues from Caenorhabditis elegans, plants, and humans. The VPS41 homologues (but not the yeast VPS41 itself) contain a conserved cysteine-rich RING-H2 zinc finger at their COOH termini. Biochemical experiments suggest that VPS41 functions in post-Golgi protein processing: the deletion mutant exhibits defective high affinity transport due to impaired Fet3p activity and also exhibits defects in the processing and sorting of multiple vacuolar hydrolases.

9161407|a|The Wnt gene family has a role in development as well as tumourigenesis. One mouse member, Wnt7a, is vital for limb development in vivo and also possesses transforming ability in vitro. This study reports the isolation of a full length of human homologue of mouse Wnt7a gene by library screening. Yeast artificial chromosome-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (YAC-FISH) mapped the WNT7A gene to chromosome 3p25. Human WNT7A had an ORF encoding a deduced protein of 349 aa that exhibited 97% and 92% identity to mouse Wnt7a at the aa and nucleic acid levels, respectively. It possessed the 22 conserved cysteine residues and 3 more at the amino terminus, and a putative poly A tail. This is the fifth human WNT gene in which a complete cDNA sequence had been determined.

9215637|t|Coassembly of TRP and TRPL produces a distinct store-operated conductance.
9215637|a|The Drosophila retinal-specific protein, TRP (transient receptor potential), is the founding member of a family of store-operated channels (SOCs) conserved from C. elegans to humans. In vitro studies indicate that TRP is a SOC, but that the related retinal protein, TRPL, is constitutively active. In the current work, we report that coexpression of TRP and TRPL leads to a store-operated, outwardly rectifying current distinct from that owing to either TRP or TRPL alone. TRP and TRPL interact directly, indicating that the TRP-TRPL-dependent current is mediated by heteromultimeric association between the two subunits. We propose that the light-activated current in photoreceptor cells is produced by a combination of TRP homo- and TRP-TRPL heteromultimers.

9215638|t|The MAD-related protein Smad7 associates with the TGFbeta receptor and functions as an antagonist of TGFbeta signaling.
9215638|a|TGFbeta signaling is initiated when the type I receptor phosphorylates the MAD-related protein, Smad2, on C-terminal serine residues. This leads to Smad2 association with Smad4, translocation to the nucleus, and regulation of transcriptional responses. Here we demonstrate that Smad7 is an inhibitor of TGFbeta signaling. Smad7 prevents TGFbeta-dependent formation of Smad2/Smad4 complexes and inhibits the nuclear accumulation of Smad2. Smad7 interacts stably with the activated TGFbeta type I receptor, thereby blocking the association, phosphorylation, and activation of Smad2. Furthermore, mutations in Smad7 that interfere with receptor binding disrupt its inhibitory activity. These studies thus define a novel function for MAD-related proteins as intracellular antagonists of the type I kinase domain of TGFbeta family receptors.

9215677|t|SOX22 is a new member of the SOX gene family, mainly expressed in human nervous tissue.
9215677|a|SOX (SRY box-containing) genes share a particular DNA-binding domain, called HMG, with the mammalian testis-determining gene SRY Several SOX genes have already been shown to be transcription factors involved in the decision of important cell fates during development. Here we report the cloning of a new human member of the SOX gene family, SOX22. The corresponding protein contains several domains that are also present in other paralogous SOX proteins. The SOX22 gene maps to chromosome 20 on band p13 and does not appear to be clustered with any other SOX gene mapped to date. SOX22 mRNA is expressed in various fetal and adult organs and tissues, suggesting that this gene plays roles in both differentiation and maintenance of several cell types.

9215685|t|A novel human serine-threonine phosphatase related to the Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) gene is selectively expressed in sensory neurons of neural crest origin.
9215685|a|Through our transcriptional mapping effort in the Xp22 region, we have isolated by exon trapping a new transcript highly homologous to the Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) gene. rdgC encodes a serine/threonine phosphatase protein and is required in Drosophila to prevent light-induced retinal degeneration. This human gene is the first mammalian member of the serine-threonine phosphatase with EF hand motif gene family, and was thus named PPEF (Protein Phosphatase with EF calcium-binding domain). The expression pattern of the mouse Ppef gene was studied by RNA in situ hybridization on embryonic tissue sections. While rdgC is expressed in the visual system of the fly, as well as in the mushroom bodies of the central brain, we found that Ppef is highly expressed in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and neural crest-derived cranial ganglia. The selective pattern of expression makes PPEF an important marker for sensory neuron differentiation and suggests a role for serine-threonine phosphatases in mammalian development.

9223305|t|Cloning and characterization of hOGG1, a human homolog of the OGG1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
9223305|a|The OGG1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a DNA glycosylase activity that is a functional analog of the Fpg protein from Escherichia coli and excises 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) from damaged DNA. The repair of this ubiquitous kind of oxidative damage is essential to prevent mutations both in bacteria and in yeast. A human cDNA clone carrying an ORF displaying homology to the yeast protein was identified. The predicted protein has 345 amino acids and a molecular mass of 39 kDa. This protein shares a 38% sequence identity with the yeast Ogg1 protein, adding this novel human gene product to the growing family of enzymes that the repair of oxidatively damaged bases and are related to the E. coli endonuclease III. Northern blot analysis indicates that this gene, localized to chromosome 3p25, is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. The cloned coding sequence was expressed in an E. coli strain that carried a disrupted fpg gene, the bacterial functional analog of OGG1. Cell-free extracts from these cultures displayed a specific lyase activity on duplex DNA that carried an 8-oxoG/C base pair. The products of the reaction are consistent with an enzymatic activity like the one displayed by the yeast Ogg1. Analysis of the substrate specificity reveals a very strong preference for DNA fragments harboring 8-oxoG/C base pairs. The pattern of specificity correlates well with the one found for the yeast enzyme. Moreover, when the human coding sequence was expressed in a yeast strain mutant in OGG1 it was able to complement the spontaneous mutator phenotype. These results make this novel gene (hOGG1) a strong candidate for the human homolog of the yeast OGG1 and suggest an important role of its product in the protection of the genome from the mutagenic effects of the oxidatively damaged purines.

9230439|t|A minK-HERG complex regulates the cardiac potassium current I(Kr).
9230439|a|MinK is a widely expressed protein of relative molecular mass approximately 15K that forms potassium channels by aggregation with other membrane proteins. MinK governs ion channel activation, regulation by second messengers, and the function and structure of the ion conduction pathway. Association of minK with a channel protein known as KvLQT1 produces a voltage-gated outward K+ current (I[sK]) resembling the slow cardiac repolarization current (I[Ks]). HERG, a human homologue of the ether-a-go-go gene of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, encodes a protein that produces the rapidly activating cardiac delayed rectifier (I[Kr]). These two potassium currents, I(Ks) and I(Kr), provide the principal repolarizing currents in cardiac myocytes for the termination of action potentials. Although heterologously expressed HERG channels are largely indistinguishable from native cardiac I(Kr), a role for minK in this current is suggested by the diminished I(Kr) in an atrial tumour line subjected to minK antisense suppression. Here we show that HERG and minK form a stable complex, and that this heteromultimerization regulates I(Kr) activity. MinK, through the formation of heteromeric channel complexes, is thus central to the control of the heart rate and rhythm.

9230442|t|X-linked IAP is a direct inhibitor of cell-death proteases.
9230442|a|The inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) family of genes has an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating programmed cell death in animals ranging from insects to humans. Ectopic expression of human IAP proteins can suppress cell death induced by a variety of stimuli, but the mechanism of this inhibition was previously unknown. Here we show that human X-chromosome-linked IAP directly inhibits at least two members of the caspase family of cell-death proteases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. As the caspases are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom and are the principal effectors of apoptosis, our findings suggest how IAPs might inhibit cell death, providing evidence for a mechanism of action for these mammalian cell-death suppressors.

9259278|a|Lack of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) results in mental retardation and macroorchidism, seen as the major pathological symptoms in fragile X patients. FMRP is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein which cosediments with the 60S ribosomal subunit. Recently, two proteins homologous to FMRP were discovered: FXR1 and FXR2. These novel proteins interact with FMRP and with each other and they are also associated with the 60S ribosomal subunit. Here, we studied the expression pattern of the three proteins in brain and testis by immunohistochemistry. In adult brain, FMR1, FXR1 and FXR2 proteins are coexpressed in the cytoplasm of specific differentiated neurons only. However, we observed a different expression pattern in fetal brain as well as in adult and fetal testis, suggesting independent functions for the three proteins in those tissues during embryonic development and adult life.

9259282|t|PHOG, a candidate gene for involvement in the short stature of Turner syndrome.
9259282|a|The abnormalities seen in Turner syndrome (monosomy X) presumably result from haploinsufficiency of certain genes on the X chromosome. Gene dosage considerations lead to the prediction that the culpable genes escape X inactivation and have functional homologs on the Y chromosome. Among the genes with these characteristics are those residing in the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) of the sex chromosomes. A pseudoautosomal location for a dosage-sensitive locus involved in stature has been suggested based on the analyses of patients with deletions of a specific segment of the short arm PAR; hemizygosity for this putative locus probably also contributes to the short stature in Turner individuals. We have isolated a gene from the critical deleted region that encodes a novel homeodomain-containing transcription factor and is expressed at highest levels in osteogenic cells. We have named the gene PHOG, for pseudoautosomal homeobox-containing osteogenic gene. Its deletion in patients with short stature, the predicted altered dosage in 45,X individuals, along with the nature of the encoded protein and its expression pattern, make PHOG an attractive candidate for involvement in the short stature of Turner syndrome. We have also found that the mouse homolog of PHOG is autosomal, which may help to explain the lack of a growth abnormality in mice with monosomy X.

9284918|a|Studies of transcriptional activation by interferons and a variety of cytokines have led to the identification of a family of proteins that serve as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). STAT4 is phosphorylated following interleukin (IL)-12 stimulation and is essential for IL-12 signal transduction. The human STAT4 cDNA was cloned, and both STAT4 and STAT1 genes were mapped to human chromosome bands 2q32.2-->q32.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. These results suggest that STAT4 and STAT1 may have arisen via a tandem gene duplication. However, human STAT1 is expressed ubiquitously, whereas human STAT4 is expressed in several tissues including spleen, heart, brain, peripheral blood cells, and testis.

9346876|t|A beta-arrestin/green fluorescent protein biosensor for detecting G protein-coupled receptor activation.
9346876|a|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) represent the single most important drug targets for medical therapy, and information from genome sequencing and genomic data bases has substantially accelerated their discovery. The lack of a systematic approach either to identify the function of a new GPCR or to associate it with a cognate ligand has added to the growing number of orphan receptors. In this work we provide a novel approach to this problem using a beta-arrestin2/green fluorescent protein conjugate (betaarr2-GFP). It provides a real-time and single cell based assay to monitor GPCR activation and GPCR-G protein-coupled receptor kinase or GPCR-arrestin interactions. Confocal microscopy demonstrates the translocation of betaarr2-GFP to more than 15 different ligand-activated GPCRs. These data clearly support the common hypothesis that the beta-arrestin binding of an activated receptor is a convergent step of GPCR signaling, increase by 5-fold the number of GPCRs known to interact with beta-arrestins, demonstrate that the cytosol is the predominant reservoir of biologically active beta-arrestins, and provide the first direct demonstration of the critical importance of G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation to the biological regulation of beta-arrestin activity and GPCR signal transduction in living cells. The use of betaarr2-GFP as a biosensor to recognize the activation of pharmacologically distinct GPCRs should accelerate the identification of orphan receptors and permit the optical study of their signal transduction biology intractable to ordinary biochemical methods.

9346890|t|Purification and cloning of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 2, a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor.
9346890|a|Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activator is a serine protease responsible for proteolytic activation of HGF in response to tissue injury and thus plays an important role in the regulation of biological functions of HGF in regenerating tissue. We previously purified an inhibitor of HGF activator (HGF activator inhibitor type 1, HAI-1) from the conditioned medium of a human stomach carcinoma cell line MKN45 and cloned its cDNA. HAI-1 is a novel member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. In the present study, we purified a second type of HGF activator inhibitor (HAI-2) from the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells and molecularly cloned its cDNA. The cDNA sequence revealed that HAI-2 is derived from a precursor protein of 252 amino acids and contains two Kunitz domains, indicating that HAI-2 is also a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. The primary translation product of HAI-2 has a hydrophobic sequence in the COOH-terminal region, suggesting that, like HAI-1, HAI-2 is produced in a membrane-associated form and secreted in a proteolytically truncated form. Because HAI-2 and HAI-1 are potent inhibitors specific for HGF activator, they may be involved in regulation of proteolytic activation of HGF in injured tissues.

9346895|t|Glycogenin-2, a novel self-glucosylating protein involved in liver glycogen biosynthesis.
9346895|a|Glycogenin is a self-glucosylating protein involved in the initiation phase of glycogen biosynthesis. A single mammalian gene had been reported to account for glycogen biogenesis in liver and muscle, the two major repositories of glycogen. We describe the characterization of novel forms of glycogenin, designated glycogenin-2 (GN-2), encoded by a second gene that is expressed preferentially in certain tissues, including liver, heart, and pancreas. Cloning of cDNAs encoding glycogenin-2 indicated the existence of multiple species, including three liver forms (GN-2alpha, GN-2beta, and GN-2gamma) generated in part by alternative splicing. Overall, GN-2 has 40-45% identity to muscle glycogenin but is 72% identical over a 200-residue segment thought to contain the catalytic domain. GN-2 expressed in Escherichia coli or COS cells is active in self-glucosylation assays, and self-glucosylated GN-2 can be elongated by skeletal muscle glycogen synthase. Antibodies raised against GN-2 produced in E. coli recognized proteins of Mr approximately 66,000 present in extracts of rat liver and in cultured H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells. In H4IIEC3 cells, most of the GN-2 was present as a free protein but some was covalently associated with glycogen fractions and was only released by treatment with alpha-amylase. H4IIEC3 cells also expressed the muscle form of glycogenin (glycogenin-1), which was attached to a chromatographically separable glycogen fraction.

9380751|t|hSK4, a member of a novel subfamily of calcium-activated potassium channels.
9380751|a|The gene for hSK4, a novel human small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, or SK channel, has been identified and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In physiological saline hSK4 generates a conductance of approximately 12 pS, a value in close agreement with that of other cloned SK channels. Like other members of this family, the polypeptide encoded by hSK4 contains a previously unnoted leucine zipper-like domain in its C terminus of unknown function. hSK4 appears unique, however, in its very high affinity for Ca2+ (EC50 of 95 nM) and its predominant expression in nonexcitable tissues of adult animals. Together with the relatively low homology of hSK4 to other SK channel polypeptides (approximately 40% identical), these data suggest that hSK4 belongs to a novel subfamily of SK channels.

9410898|t|Human pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with a defect in GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta chain expression.
9410898|a|Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a heterogeneous disorder of genetic or acquired etiologies. In some cases congenital PAP is associated with hereditary surfactant protein (SP)-B deficiency. To date, the molecular defect in the majority of patients with PAP has not been identified. In mice, PAP has been generated by targeted deletion of the genes for either the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta chain (beta c) or GM-CSF. Here, we describe an expression defect of beta c in three of seven pediatric patients with PAP and in one patient with severe lung disease suspected to be PAP. The patients failed to express normal levels of beta c as shown by flow cytometry. Strikingly reduced or absent function of beta c was demonstrated by ligand binding studies and progenitor clonogenic assays. Analysis of beta c DNA revealed a point mutation from proline to threonine at codon 602 in one patient. Our findings provide evidence that a defect in the expression of a hematopoietic cytokine receptor is associated with human PAP.

9473669|t|Characterization and functional expression of the cDNA encoding human brain quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase.
9473669|a|Mammalian quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRTase) (EC 2.4.2.19) is a key enzyme in catabolism of quinolinate, an intermediate in the tryptophan-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) pathway. Quinolinate acts as a most potent endogenous exitotoxin to neurons. Elevation of quinolinate levels in the brain has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. As the first step to elucidate molecular basis underlying the quinolinate metabolism, the cDNA encoding human brain QPRTase was cloned and characterized. Utilizing partial amino acid sequences obtained from highly purified porcine kidney QPRTase, a human isolog was obtained from a human brain cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a open reading frame of 297 amino acids, and shares 30 to 40% identity with those of bacterial QPRTases. To confirm that the cDNA clone encodes human QPRTase, its functional expression was studied in a bacterial host. Introduction of the human cDNA into a QPRTase defective (nadC) E. coli strain brought about an abrupt increase in QPRTase activity and allowed the cells to grow in the absence of nicotinic acid. It is concluded that the cloned cDNA encodes human QPRTase which is functional beyond the phylogenic boundary.

9479038|t|Identification of a new tumour-associated antigen TM4SF5 and its expression in human cancer.
9479038|a|In a previous large-scale screening for differentially expressed genes in pancreatic cancer, a gene was identified that was highly overexpressed in pancreatic cancer encoding a novel putative tetraspan transmembrane protein highly homologous to the tumour-associated antigen L6. Using a radiation hybrid panel the identified human gene named TM4SF5 (transmembrane 4 superfamily member 5) was localized to chromosome 17 in the region 17p13.3. The cloned TM4SF5 cDNA has a 32bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a 591bp open reading frame (ORF) and a 85bp 3'UTR. The predicted TM4SF5 protein with 197 amino acids contains three NH2-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane regions, followed by an extracellular hydrophilic domain containing two potential N-linked glycosylation sites and a COOH-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region. These structural features are shared by the L6 antigen and a number of related cell surface proteins associated with cell growth. TM4SF5 was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues as compared to both normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis tissues, and was detected at high levels in other tumour tissues. Although the precise function of TM4SF5 remains to be elucidated it may be useful in a clinical setting for tumour diagnosis and/or therapy. This hypothesis is supported by the strong homology to the L6 antigen, which has proved promising in immunological, therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.

9480843|t|Triplet repeat-containing ribosomal protein L14 gene in immortalized human endothelial cell line (t-HUE4).
9480843|a|A cDNA encoding human 60S ribosomal subunit protein L14 (hRL14) was isolated from a human immortal endothelial cell line, t-HUE4. This cell line was established via a series of cell lines cultured in a serum-free and a protein-free medium, and a directional cDNA library has been constructed and screened in search for the genes modulating protein synthesis machinery in cell proliferation. A putative full-length clone with an open reading frame of 220 amino acids; predicted molecular weight of 23.6 kDa. A significant identity for hRL14 was observed with rat RL14 (85% identity), with exception of COOH-terminal region, but not with any eukaryote amino acid sequences so far deposited to database. The typical features of ribosomal proteins were observed in hRL14, as seen in nuclear targeting sequences necessary for the transport from cytoplasm to nucleolus, a bZIP like (basic region-leucine zipper) element for the binding to rRNA, and the internal repeat sequences; the pentapeptide QKA(A/S)X. The COOH-terminal region of the transcripts contained fifteen triplet repeats (GCT; alanine) at nucleotide 465 to 509, which is significantly expanded compared to the rat RL14. However, the repeat number was all the same among the normal human endothelial cell line and the cell lines established in the course of t-HUE4 establishment. A single band with about 800 bases was identified by Northern blot analysis without tissue specificity. This GCT repeat was found to be one of the longest uninterrupted repeats in a coding sequence, which were associated with the highest degree of polymorphism.

9480844|t|Molecular cloning of human D-dopachrome tautomerase cDNA: N-terminal proline is essential for enzyme activation.
9480844|a|D-Dopachrome tautomerase converts 2-carboxy-2,3-dihydroindole-5,6-quinone (D-dopachrome) into 5,6-dihydroxyindole. This protein has an amino acid sequence that is highly homologous with that of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which has the potential to catalyze D-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid and is an important cytokine for T-lymphocyte activation. We isolated and sequenced a 566 bp-long cDNA encoding human D-dopachrome tautomerase. The cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding 118 amino acids, including the initiator methionine. The amino acid sequence of the protein shares 80% homology with that of the rat enzyme. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that mRNA of D-dopachrome tautomerase is expressed in a large amount in the liver, and to lesser extent in other organs, including the heart, lung and pancreas. After purification of D-dopachrome tautomerase expressed in E. coli, we confirmed that the recombinant protein catalyzes the conversion of D-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole. Its catalytic mechanism is not well understood. We found that the protein completely lost the enzyme activity when the N-terminal proline residue was replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. This fact suggests that the N-terminal proline is essential for the catalytic mechanism. Although the precise pathophysiological function of D-dopachrome tautomerase remains to be elucidated, the present results could contribute to further understanding of isomerase activity in relation to the immune response.

9480859|t|Isolation of full-length cDNA of mouse PAX4 gene and identification of its human homologue.
9480859|a|Recent genetic studies have suggested that PAX4, a member of the paired box (PAX) gene family, is involved in the mechanism regulating the fate of pancreatic islet endocrine progenitor cells. Murine PAX4 was originally identified by genomic screening and, to date, only a partial sequence of PAX4 has been reported. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of mouse PAX4 by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) using RNA from MIN6 cells, a mouse insulinoma cell line. The full length of cDNA was 1.38 kb, consistent with the estimated size of the transcript by Northern blot. The deduced mouse PAX4 protein was 349 amino acids and had the predicted molecular weight of 38 kDa. Two DNA binding motifs, a 128-amino acid paired domain and a 61-amino acid paired-type homeodomain exhibit the highest amino acid homology with PAX6 (71.2%, 65.0%, respectively), another member of the PAX gene family. However, the sequence of the C-terminal segment of PAX4 diverged and showed no significant homology with any other known PAX genes. As to the genomic DNA, the coding region of the mouse PAX4 gene spanned approximately 5.5 kb and was composed of 10 exons. In the public DNA database, a human cosmid (g1572c264), which was localized on human chromosome 7q31.3, was found to contain a gene homologous to PAX4. The nucleotide and protein sequence homologies between mouse PAX4 and its human homologue were 83.1% and 80.0%, respectively. Interestingly, the ARP5 (ADP-ribosylation factor 5) gene was also found in the same cosmid g1572c264, suggesting the ARP5 gene to be adjacent to the human PAX4 homologue. The human cosmid g1572c264 contains at least four SSRPs (simple sequence repeat polymorphism), which could be used for genetic linkage studies of the locus. The results of this study, i.e. isolation of the full-length cDNA sequence of PAX4 and identification of the homologous human gene, will facilitate further functional and genetic studies of the PAX4 gene.

9480897|a|The Expressed Sequence Tag database has been searched for examples of previously undescribed human Alpha class glutathione transferases. An incomplete transcript of the previously described GSTA3 gene was identified in a cDNA library derived from 8-9 week placenta. This indicates that the GSTA3 gene is functional and is possibly under specific developmental regulation. A second cDNA, termed GSTA4, was identified in a brain cDNA library. The encoded GSTA4-4 enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and was found to be immunologically distinct from GSTA1-1 and to have high activity with alk-2-enals. Although GSTA4-4 appears to be functionally similar to the mouse GST5.7 and rat GST8-8 Alpha class enzymes, sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis suggest that GSTA4-4 may be a member of a distinct Alpha class subgroup.

9508771|t|Actinin-4, a novel actin-bundling protein associated with cell motility and cancer invasion.
9508771|a|Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton may play a crucial role in cell motility and cancer invasion. We have produced a monoclonal antibody (NCC- Lu-632, IgM, k) reactive with an antigenic protein that is upregulated upon enhanced cell movement. The cDNA for the antigen molecule was found to encode a novel isoform of nonmuscle alpha-actinin. This isoform (designated actinin-4) was concentrated in the cytoplasm where cells were sharply extended and in cells migrating and located at the edge of cell clusters, but was absent from focal adhesion plaques or adherens junctions, where the classic isoform (actinin-1) was concentrated. Actinin-4 shifted steadily from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase or actin depolymerization. The cytoplasmic localization of actinin-4 was closely associated with an infiltrative histological phenotype and correlated significantly with a poorer prognosis in 61 cases of breast cancer. These findings suggest that cytoplasmic actinin-4 regulates the actin cytoskeleton and increases cellular motility and that its inactivation by transfer to the nucleus abolishes the metastatic potential of human cancers.

9539768|t|HLA-G expression in melanoma: a way for tumor cells to escape from immunosurveillance.
9539768|a|Considering the well established role of nonclassical HLA-G class I molecules in inhibiting natural killer (NK) cell function, the consequence of abnormal HLA-G expression in malignant cells should be the escape of tumors from immunosurveillance. To examine this hypothesis, we analyzed HLA-G expression and NK sensitivity in human malignant melanoma cells. Our analysis of three melanoma cell lines and ex vivo biopsy demonstrated that (i) IGR and M74 human melanoma cell lines exhibit a high level of HLA-G transcription with differential HLA-G isoform transcription and protein expression patterns, (ii) a higher level of HLA-G transcription ex vivo is detected in a skin melanoma metastasis biopsy compared with a healthy skin fragment from the same individual, and (iii) HLA-G protein isoforms other than membrane-bound HLA-G1 protect IGR from NK lysis. It thus appears of critical importance to consider the specific role of HLA-G expression in tumors in the design of future cancer immunotherapies.

9539796|t|A third member of the synapsin gene family.
9539796|a|Synapsins are a family of neuron-specific synaptic vesicle-associated phosphoproteins that have been implicated in synaptogenesis and in the modulation of neurotransmitter release. In mammals, distinct genes for synapsins I and II have been identified, each of which gives rise to two alternatively spliced isoforms. We have now cloned and characterized a third member of the synapsin gene family, synapsin III, from human DNA. Synapsin III gives rise to at least one protein isoform, designated synapsin IIIa, in several mammalian species. Synapsin IIIa is associated with synaptic vesicles, and its expression appears to be neuron-specific. The primary structure of synapsin IIIa conforms to the domain model previously described for the synapsin family, with domains A, C, and E exhibiting the highest degree of conservation. Synapsin IIIa contains a novel domain, termed domain J, located between domains C and E. The similarities among synapsins I, II, and III in domain organization, neuron-specific expression, and subcellular localization suggest a possible role for synapsin III in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptogenesis. The human synapsin III gene is located on chromosome 22q12-13, which has been identified as a possible schizophrenia susceptibility locus. On the basis of this localization and the well established neurobiological roles of the synapsins, synapsin III represents a candidate gene for schizophrenia.

9547368|t|The relationship between agonist intrinsic activity and the rate of endocytosis of muscarinic receptors in a human neuroblastoma cell line.
9547368|a|The molecular mechanisms underlying the internalization of G protein-coupled receptors are still poorly understood. Normally agonists but not antagonists cause internalization (defined here as a reduction in the number of receptors at the cell surface), suggesting a functional relationship between agonist activity and internalization. In this study we investigated the effects of eight muscarinic ligands on the rate constants for endocytosis and recycling of m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We found that there was a linear correlation between the intrinsic activity of the ligand and its ability to increase the rate constant for endocytosis, suggesting that the same active conformation of the receptor is responsible for stimulating both second messenger generation and receptor endocytosis. In contrast, the rate constant for recycling did not depend on which agonist had triggered receptor endocytosis, suggesting that recycling is a purely constitutive process. Because receptor internalization depends on the rate constants for both endocytosis and recycling, the relationship between internalization and intrinsic activity is nonlinear. In particular, mathematical modeling of receptor trafficking revealed that under certain conditions very small (3% or less) increases in the rate constant for endocytosis are sufficient to cause substantial receptor internalization. An important implication of this analysis is that extremely weak partial agonists (which may in practice be indistinguishable from antagonists) may produce significant receptor internalization.

9600082|t|Non-histone chromosomal proteins HMG1 and 2 enhance ligation reaction of DNA double-strand breaks.
9600082|a|DNA ligase IV in a complex with XRCC4 is responsible for DNA end-joining in repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and V(D)J recombination. We found that non-histone chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) proteins 1 and 2 enhanced the ligation of linearized pUC119 DNA with DNA ligase IV from rat liver nuclear extract. Intra-molecular and inter-molecular ligations of cohesive-ended and blunt-ended DNA were markedly stimulated by HMG1 and 2. Recombinant HMG2-domain A, B, and (A + B) polypeptides were similarly, but non-identically, effective for the stimulation of DSB ligation reaction. Ligation of single-strand breaks (nicks) was only slightly activated by the HMG proteins. The DNA end-binding Ku protein singly or in combination with the catalytic component of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as the DNA-PK holoenzyme was ineffective for the ligation of linearized pUC119 DNA. Although the stimulatory effect of HMG1 and 2 on ligation of DSB in vitro was not specific to DNA ligase IV, these results suggest that HMG1 and 2 are involved in the final ligation step in DNA end-joining processes of DSB repair and V(D)J recombination.

9603950|t|The eukaryotic UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylases. Gene cloning, protein expression, and catalytic mechanism.
9603950|a|A search of the yeast data base for a protein homologous to Escherichia coli UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase yielded UAP1 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase), the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase. The Candida albicans and human homologs were also cloned by screening a C. albicans genomic library and a human testis cDNA library, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that the human UAP1 cDNA was identical to previously reported AGX1. A null mutation of the S. cerevisiae UAP1 (ScUAP1) gene was lethal, and when expressed under the control of ScUAP1 promoter, both C. albicans and Homo sapiens UAP1 (CaUAP1 and HsUAP1) rescued the ScUAP1-deficient S. cerevisiae cells. All the recombinant ScUap1p, CaUap1p, and HsUap1p possessed UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase activities in vitro. The yeast Uap1p utilized N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate as the substrate, and together with Agm1p, it produced UDP-N-acetylglucosamine from N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate. These results demonstrate that the UAP1 genes indeed specify eukaryotic UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase and that phosphomutase reaction precedes uridyltransfer. Sequence comparison with other UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases revealed that amino acid residues, Gly112, Gly114, Thr115, Arg116, Pro122, and Lys123 of ScUap1p are highly conserved in UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases reported to date. Among these amino acids, alanine substitution for Gly112, Arg116, or Lys123 severely diminished the activity, suggesting that Gly112, Arg116, or Lys123 are possible catalytic residues of the enzyme.

9624006|t|Role of Mxi1 in ageing organ systems and the regulation of normal and neoplastic growth.
9624006|a|Mxi1 belongs to the Mad (Mxi1) family of proteins, which function as potent antagonists of Myc oncoproteins. This antagonism relates partly to their ability to compete with Myc for the protein Max and for consensus DNA binding sites and to recruit transcriptional co-repressors. Mad(Mxi1) proteins have been suggested to be essential in cellular growth control and/or in the induction and maintenance of the differentiated state. Consistent with these roles, mxi1 may be the tumour-suppressor gene that resides at region 24-26 of the long arm of chromosome 10. This region is a cancer hotspot, and mutations here may be involved in several cancers, including prostate adenocarcinoma. Here we show that mice lacking Mxi1 exhibit progressive, multisystem abnormalities. These mice also show increased susceptibility to tumorigenesis either following carcinogen treatment or when also deficient in Ink4a. This cancer-prone phenotype may correlate with the enhanced ability of several mxi1-deficient cell types, including prostatic epithelium, to proliferate. Our results show that Mxi1 is involved in the homeostasis of differentiated organ systems, acts as a tumour suppressor in vivo, and engages the Myc network in a functionally relevant manner.

9655184|t|DNA sequence and muscle-specific expression of human sarcosin transcripts.
9655184|a|We have characterized two abundant human cDNAs which, through Northern hybridization analysis, are selectively expressed in human sarcomeric muscle. DNA sequencing was performed and the two cDNAs were found to share sequence identity, with the exception of a 3' UTR extension present on the longer transcript. Our data suggest that the two transcripts are generated through alternative use of two poly(A) addition signals. The cDNAs encode a large open reading frame encompassing at least 435 codons. Through sequence comparisons, both at the DNA and predicted amino acid sequence level, we have been unable to find significant sequence similarity to any other characterized sequence. Consequently, we have termed this novel human sequence sarcosin. Although novel, Southern hybridization analysis demonstrated that the sarcosin sequence has been conserved in several mammalian species.

9662395|t|Identification of the gene responsible for Best macular dystrophy.
9662395|a|Best macular dystrophy (BMD), also known as vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD2; OMIM 153700), is an autosomal dominant form of macular degeneration characterized by an abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin within and beneath the retinal pigment epithelium cells. In pursuit of the disease gene, we limited the minimum genetic region by recombination breakpoint analysis and mapped to this region a novel retina-specific gene (VMD2). Genetic mapping data, identification of five independent disease-specific mutations and expression studies provide evidence that mutations within the candidate gene are a cause of BMD. The 3' UTR of the candidate gene contains a region of antisense complementarity to the 3' UTR of the ferritin heavy-chain gene (FTH1), indicating the possibility of antisense interaction between VMD2 and FTH1 transcripts.

9662397|t|BRCA1 protein is linked to the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex via RNA helicase A.
9662397|a|The breast cancer specific tumour suppressor protein, BRCA1 (refs 1,2), activates transcription when linked with a DNA-binding domain and is a component of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) holoenzyme. We show here that RNA helicase A (RHA) protein links BRCA1 to the holoenzyme complex. The region of BRCA1 which interacts with RHA and, thus, the holoenzyme complex, corresponds to subregions of the BRCT domain of BRCA1 (ref. 9). This interaction was shown to occur in yeast nuclei, and expression in human cells of a truncated RHA molecule which retains binding to BRCA1 inhibited transcriptional activation mediated by the BRCA1 carboxy terminus. These data are the first to identify a specific protein interaction with the BRCA1 C-terminal domain and are consistent with the model that BRCA1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator.

9662398|t|Total colourblindness is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the cone photoreceptor cGMP-gated cation channel.
9662398|a|Total colourblindness (OMIM 216900), also referred to as rod monochromacy (RM) or complete achromatopsia, is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited and congenital disorder characterized by photophobia, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus and the complete inability to discriminate between colours. Electroretinographic recordings show that in RM, rod photoreceptor function is normal, whereas cone photoreceptor responses are absent. The locus for RM has been mapped to chromosome 2q11 (ref. 2), however the gene underlying RM has not yet been identified. Recently, a suitable candidate gene, CNGA3, encoding the alpha-subunit of the cone photoreceptor cGMP-gated cation channel, a key component of the phototransduction pathway, has been cloned and assigned to human chromosome 2q11 (refs 3,4). We report the identification of missense mutations in CNGA3 in five families with RM. Homozygous mutations are present in two families, whereas the remaining families show compound heterozygous mutations. In all cases, the segregation pattern of the mutations is consistent with the autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease and all mutations affect amino acids that are highly conserved among cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNG) in various species. This is the first report of a colour vision disorder caused by defects other than mutations in the cone pigment genes, and implies at least in this instance a common genetic basis for phototransduction in the three different cone photoreceptors of the human retina.

9662399|a|The locus for the incomplete form of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2) maps to a 1.1-Mb region in Xp11.23 between markers DXS722 and DXS255. We identified a retina-specific calcium channel alpha1-subunit gene (CACNA1F) in this region, consisting of 48 exons encoding 1966 amino acids and showing high homology to L-type calcium channel alpha1-subunits. Mutation analysis in 13 families with CSNB2 revealed nine different mutations in 10 families, including three nonsense and one frameshift mutation. These data indicate that aberrations in a voltage-gated calcium channel, presumably causing a decrease in neurotransmitter release from photoreceptor presynaptic terminals, are a frequent cause of CSNB2.

9700164|t|ZW10 helps recruit dynactin and dynein to the kinetochore.
9700164|a|Mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster zw10 gene, which encodes a conserved, essential kinetochore component, abolish the ability of dynein to localize to kinetochores. Several similarities between the behavior of ZW10 protein and dynein further support a role for ZW10 in the recruitment of dynein to the kinetochore: (a) in response to bipolar tension across the chromosomes, both proteins mostly leave the kinetochore at metaphase, when their association with the spindle becomes apparent; (b) ZW10 and dynein both bind to functional neocentromeres of structurally acentric minichromosomes; and (c) the localization of both ZW10 and dynein to the kinetochore is abolished in cells mutant for the gene rough deal. ZW10's role in the recruitment of dynein to the kinetochore is likely to be reasonably direct, because dynamitin, the p50 subunit of the dynactin complex, interacts with ZW10 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Since in zw10 mutants no defects in chromosome behavior are observed before anaphase onset, our results suggest that dynein at the kinetochore is essential for neither microtubule capture nor congression to the metaphase plate. Instead, dynein's role at the kinetochore is more likely to be involved in the coordination of chromosome separation and/or poleward movement at anaphase onset.

9766636|t|The IFN-inducible nucleoprotein IFI 16 is expressed in cells of the monocyte lineage, but is rapidly and markedly down-regulated in other myeloid precursor populations.
9766636|a|IFI 16 is an interferon-inducible nucleoprotein expressed by human monocytes. IFI 16 and a related mouse protein, p202, control cellular proliferation by binding and modulating the functions of cell cycle regulatory factors including p53 and the retinoblastoma gene product, pRb. In this study, we examined IFI 16 expression in myeloid precursor cells cultured in vitro in colony-forming assays using granulocyte (G-) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-) colony-stimulating factor (CSF). IFI 16 was expressed in 100% of CD34+ cells isolated from human bone marrow. When the CD34+ cells were induced to differentiate, two sub-populations of cells were identified by two-color cytofluorography: the CD14+ (monocytoid) cells all expressed IFI 16, whereas the CD14- (polymorphonuclear precursor) cells did not. The strongest expression of IFI 16 was in the cells staining brightest for CD14, whereas depletion of CD14+ monocytoid cells from mixed monocytic/granulocytic cultures largely abolished IFI 16-stained cells. Furthermore, in eight independent colony-forming assays, the number of IFI 16+ cells correlated closely with the numbers of monocyte precursors identified morphologically (R2 = 0.99), but was unrelated to the numbers of myelocytes, promyelocytes, and metamyelocytes; nor was IFI 16 expressed by erythroid or eosinophil precursors. We conclude that IFI 16 is expressed in CD34+ and monocytoid daughter cells, but is rapidly and markedly down-regulated at the corresponding stages of polymorphonuclear and erythroid development. This differential expression of IFI 16 in myeloid precursor subpopulations and its perceived molecular properties are consistent with a possible role in regulating myelopoiesis.

9766643|t|A novel candidate oncogene, MCT-1, is involved in cell cycle progression.
9766643|a|Using the arbitrarily primed-PCR (AP-PCR) assay to detect genetic abnormalities that occur in a panel of lymphoid cell lines, we identified an amplified stretch of genomic DNA that contained a putative open reading frame. Northern blot analysis with this genomic clone revealed widespread low level expression in normal human tissue. The full cDNA sequence was obtained with no significant homology to any known genes in the genome database. We termed this novel gene with multiple copies in a T-cell malignancy as MCT-1. MCT-1 was localized to the long arm of chromosome Xq22-24 by flourescence in situ hybridization analysis. Although there was no significant homology at the primary sequence level, there was a limited degree of amino acid homology with a domain of cyclin H that appears to specify protein-protein complexes. This relationship between MCT-1 and cyclin H implied a potential role for MCT-1 in cell cycle regulation. Overexpression of MCT-1 increased the proliferative rate of cells by decreasing the length of the G1 phase without a reciprocal increase in the S and G2-M phases. Recent work has established the role of cell cycle regulatory molecules in the development of certain human malignancies. Therefore, we investigated the transforming ability of MCT-1 overexpression using soft agar growth assays and demonstrated that only MCT-1-overexpressing cells were able to establish colonies. Taken together, MCT-1 is a novel candidate oncogene with homology to a protein-protein binding domain of cyclin H.

9792917|t|Identification of a principal mRNA species for human 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoform (AKR1C3) that exhibits high prostaglandin D2 11-ketoreductase activity.
9792917|a|Human 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase exists in four isoforms, which belong to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and are named AKR1C1-AKR1C4. The properties of AKR1C3 have not been fully characterized compared to the other isoforms. In addition, a cDNA that shows more than 99% homology with AKR1C3 cDNA has been cloned from human myeloblasts. We have here expressed and purified a recombinant enzyme (designated as DBDH) from this cDNA. DBDH oxidized xenobiotic alicyclic alcohols and 3alpha- or 17beta-hydroxy-5beta-androstanes, and catalyzed the reversible conversion between prostaglandin D2 and 9alpha,11beta-prostaglandin F2 more efficiently than that of 3alpha- or 17beta-hydroxysteroids:the respective Km values were 0.6 and 6.8 microM, and kcat/Km values were about 1,000 min-1.mM-1. Anti-inflammatory drugs highly inhibited the enzyme. The recombinant AKR1C3 prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of DBDH also showed the same properties as the wild-type DBDH. Analyses of expression of mRNAs for DBDH and AKR1C3 by reverse transcription-PCR indicated that only one mRNA species for DBDH is expressed in 33 human specimens of liver, kidney, lung, brain, heart, spleen, adrenal gland, small intestine, placenta, prostate, and testis. These results suggest that AKR1C3 acts as prostaglandin D2 11-ketoreductase, and that its principal gene in the human has a coding region represented by DBDH cDNA.

9862446|t|Identification of a retinoic acid responsive aldoketoreductase expressed in HL60 leukaemic cells.
9862446|a|Neutrophil and monocyte differentiation can be induced in HL60 leukaemia cells by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3), respectively, whose differentiating effects can be enhanced by exposure to 'anti-inflammatory agents' and steroids. We have provided evidence that this potentiation is via inhibition of the activity of an enzyme of the aldoketoreductase (AKR) family, but had failed to identify expression of known AKRs in HL60 cells. In this study, we have identified a previously unclassified aldoketoreductase family member (termed HAKR e) that is expressed in HL60 cells. HAKR e is dramatically and transiently up-regulated in HL60 cells within 24 h of exposure to ATRA, further supporting the proposition that a member(s) of this family of enzymes play(s) a role in controlling cell growth and/or differentiation.

9930991|t|Overexpression and functional characterization of kinin receptors reveal subtype-specific phosphorylation.
9930991|a|G protein-coupled receptors such as the receptors for bradykinin are present in low copy numbers in most natural cells. To overcome the problems associated with the analysis of these receptors at the protein level, we used highly efficient expression systems such as the baculovirus/insect cell system. However, the structural and functional statuses of recombinant receptors have often remained elusive. We have expressed the two types of human kinin receptors, B1 and B2, in Sf9 cells. Both receptors are found on the surface of infected cells where they display the same pharmacological profiles as their cognate receptors of native cells. The functional analysis of kinin receptors coupled to the intracellular signaling pathways of Sf9 cells revealed differential patterns of ligand-induced phosphorylation for the two kinin receptors. The B1 receptor failed to undergo ligand-induced phosphorylation. However the B2 receptor showed selective phosphorylation of a minor 38 kDa band and lack of phosphorylation of a dominant 33 kDa band, indicating that only a fraction of the receptor protein is functionally linked to the kinase pathway. A striking discrepancy between the number of binding sites and the amount of receptor protein per cell (molar ratio of 1:20 to 1:1000) indicated that a significant portion of kinin receptors is associated with the intracellular compartments of Sf9 cells. Pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the heterogeneity of recombinant receptors is not due to proteolytic processing but likely reflects incomplete or lacking N-glycosylation. We conclude that the baculovirus/Sf9 system is suitable for the recombinant expression and functional analysis of kinin receptors though limitations of the system have to be considered.

9931460|t|Isolation of hMRE11B: failure to complement yeast mre11 defects due to species-specific protein interactions.
9931460|a|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MRE11 gene plays an important role in meiotic recombination, mitotic DNA repair and telomere maintenance. We present the isolation of hMRE11B cDNA from a human HeLa cell cDNA library as an MRE11 homolog. Compared to the previously identified hMRE11, hMRE11B contains an additional 84bp sequence that results in a 28 amino-acid insertion close to the C-terminus. The expression pattern of hMRE11B in different tissues shows the presence of two mRNA species of approx. 2.6 and 7.5kb. Overexpression of hMRE11B does not complement the alkylation sensitivity of the mre11 null and temperature-sensitive mutant strains. In this study, we examine factors that may explain this lack of complementation. First, both Northern and Western analyses rule out the lack of hMRE11B transcription and/or translation in yeast. Second, we demonstrate that hMre11B, like the yeast Mre11 protein, dimerizes in vivo in a yeast two-hybrid system. This dimerization requires the C-terminal one-third of hMre11B protein, which includes the 28 amino acids absent in hMre11. However, hMre11B does not interact with Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2. Hence, the lack of protein-protein interaction between hMre11B and the yeast Mre11, Rad50, and Xrs2 may explain the inability of hMRE11B to complement the yeast mre11 mutants. We rule out the hypothesis that the lack of interaction and, in turn of complementation, is due to the absence of sequence homology at the C-terminal domain of hMre11B compared to the yeast Mre11. Instead, we propose that the C-terminus of hMre11B participates in protein-protein interaction and functions in a species-specific manner.

9931490|t|XCE, a new member of the endothelin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase family, is preferentially expressed in the CNS.
9931490|a|In the present study, we have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel member of the family of zinc metallopeptidases that includes neutral endopeptidase and endothelin-converting enzyme. The predicted amino-acid sequence of this enzyme, termed XCE, consists of 775 amino-acids with a single putative membrane-spanning region, an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 59 residues, and a large luminal domain that contains a characteristic zinc-binding motif. Western blot analysis of cells stably expressing this new metallopeptidase revealed a glycosylated protein of approximately 95 kDa. XCE mRNA was found to be predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, sympathetic ganglia and in uterine subepithelial cells. In the rat and human CNS, a very specific pattern of neuronal labelling (in presumptive cholinergic interneurons of basal ganglia, basal forebrain neurons, as well as brainstem and spinal cord motoneurons) was detected by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The enzyme substrate, as yet unidentified, might be found among the numerous neuropeptide transmitters which are colocalized with acetylcholine in these neurons.

9857230|t|Cytotoxicity of Fas ligand against lymphoma cells with radiation-induced Fas antigen.
9857230|a|Fas antigen, also termed APO-1 or CD95, is a transmembrane protein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily which mediates apoptosis upon oligomerization. The Fas/Fas ligand system is considered to be a key regulator of apoptosis. Recently, we have demonstrated that Fas antigen expression is induced by low-dose irradiation of some types of lymphomas, and we also demonstrated that irradiation-induced Fas antigen expression increased with the passage of time until peaking at 48 h after irradiation in CML-C1, CML-C2, DL-40, and DL-95 cell lines. In this study, we also examined the potential cytotoxicity of Fas ligand peptide against several types of lymphoma/leukemia cell lines that showed induction of Fas antigen expression under irradiation. Flow cytometry analysis was performed at 6, 24 and 48 h after irradiation. Samples (1 x10(6) cells/ml) from irradiated and non-irradiated cells of each cell line were incubated with or without 5 microg/ml of Fas ligand peptide for 2 h at 37 degrees C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) in air. The killing effect of Fas ligand against cell lines of CML-C1, DL-40, and DL-95 were clearly identified as the percentage of cells with Fas antigen expression induced by irradiation. Concerning HD-70 cell line, for which soluble Fas antigen has been identified, the killing effects were clearly observed in samples pre-treated with PBS washings. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a possible application of the Fas/Fas ligand system in treatment of certain types of malignancies in which Fas antigen is inducible by irradiation.

11781689|t|Haplotype analysis in Icelandic and Finnish BRCA2 999del5 breast cancer families.
11781689|a|The 999del5 mutation is the single, strong BRCA2 founder mutation in Iceland and the most common BRCA1/2 founder mutation in Finland. To evaluate the origin and time since spreading of the 999del5 mutation in Iceland and in Finland, we constructed haplotypes with polymorphic markers within and flanking the BRCA2 gene in a set of 18 Icelandic and 10 Finnish 999del5 breast cancer families. All Icelandic families analysed shared a common core haplotype of about 1.7 cM. The common ancestors for the Icelandic families studied were estimated to trace back to 340-1000 years, not excluding the possibility that the mutation was brought to Iceland during the settlement of the country. Analysis of the Finnish families revealed two distinct haplotypes. A rare one, found in three families in the old settlement region in southwestern Finland, shared a four-marker (0.5 cM) core haplotype with the Icelandic 999del5 haplotype. A distinct approximately 6 cM haplotype was shared by seven 999del5 Finnish families estimated to have a common ancestry 140-300 years ago. These families cluster in two geographical regions in Finland, in the very same area as those with the rare haplotype and also in the most eastern, late settlement region of Finland. The results may indicate a common ancient origin for the 999del5 mutation in Iceland and in Finland, but distinct mutational events cannot be ruled out. The surprising finding of the same mutation in two completely different haplotypes in a sparsely populated area in Finland may suggest gene conversion.

11854171|t|KRIT1 association with the integrin-binding protein ICAP-1: a new direction in the elucidation of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM1) pathogenesis.
11854171|a|Mutations in KRIT1, a protein initially identified based on a yeast two-hybrid interaction with the RAS-family GTPase RAP1A, are responsible for the development of the inherited vascular disorder cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM1). As the function of the KRIT1 protein and its role in CCM pathogenesis remain unknown, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens to identify additional protein binding partners. A fragment containing the N-terminal 272 amino acid residues of KRIT1, a region lacking similarity to any known protein upon database searches, was used as bait. From parallel screens of human fetal brain and HeLa cDNA libraries, we obtained multiple independent isolates of human integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1 (ICAP-1) as interacting clones. The interaction of KRIT1 and ICAP-1 was confirmed by GST-KRIT1 trapping of endogenous ICAP-1 from 293T cells. The alpha isoform of ICAP-1 is a 200 amino acid serine/threonine-rich phosphoprotein which binds the cytoplasmic tail of beta1 integrins. We show that mutagenesis of the N-terminal KRIT1 NPXY amino acid sequence, a motif critical for ICAP-1 binding to beta1 integrin molecules, completely abrogates the KRIT1/ICAP-1 interaction. The interaction between ICAP-1 and KRIT1, and the presence of a FERM domain in the latter, suggest that KRIT1 might be involved in the bidirectional signaling between integrin molecules and the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, these data suggest that KRIT1 might affect cell adhesion processes via integrin signaling in CCM1 pathogenesis.

11875050|t|Mutations in the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IMPDH1) cause the RP10 form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.
11875050|a|Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is a heterogeneous set of progressive retinopathies caused by several distinct genes. One locus, the RP10 form of adRP, maps to human chromosome 7q31.1 and may account for 5-10% of adRP cases among Americans and Europeans. We identified two American families with the RP10 form of adRP by linkage mapping and used these families to reduce the linkage interval to 3.45 Mb between the flanking markers D7S686 and RP-STR8. Sequence and transcript analysis identified 54 independent genes within this region, at least 10 of which are retinal-expressed and thus candidates for the RP10 gene. A screen of retinal transcripts comparing retinas from normal mice to retinas from crx-/crx- knockout mice (with poorly differentiated photoreceptors) demonstrated a 6-fold reduction in one candidate, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1; EC 1.1.1.205). Since many of the genes known to cause retinitis pigmentosa are under CRX control in photoreceptors, IMPDH1 became a high-priority candidate for mutation screening. DNA sequencing of affected individuals from the two American RP10 families revealed a GAC-->AAC transition in codon 226 substituting an asparagine for an aspartic acid in both families. The identical mutation was also found in a British RP10 family. The Asp226Asn missense mutation is present in all affected individuals tested and absent from unaffected controls. The aspartic acid at codon 226 is conserved in all IMPDH genes, in all species examined, including bacteria, suggesting that this mutation is highly deleterious. Subsequent screening of probands from 60 other adRP families revealed an additional family with this mutation, confirming its association with retinitis pigmentosa and the relatively high frequency of this mutation. Another IMPDH1 substitution, Val268Ile, was also observed in this cohort of patients but not in controls. IMPDH1 is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme, functioning as a homotetramer, which catalyzed the rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. As such, it plays an important role in cyclic nucleoside metabolism within photoreceptors. Several classes of drugs are known to affect IMPDH isoenzymes, including nucleotide and NAD analogs, suggesting that small-molecule therapy may be available, one day, for RP10 patients.

11909764|t|Lead induced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes of exposed workers: role of reactive oxygen species and protein kinase C.
11909764|a|Lead and lead compounds play a significant role in modern industry; a wide variety of population is at risk of occupational exposure and lead is suspected to be a human carcinogen. The biochemical and molecular mechanisms of lead toxicity are poorly understood, but emerging data suggest that some of the effects of lead may be due to its interference with calcium in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and/or through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Many of these results are conducted in vitro on cell lines or ex vivo on human lymphocytes treated in vitro. We, therefore, performed a study on the induction of DNA damage, using the alkaline comet assay, in lymphocytes of battery plant workers. To elucidate in vivo the mechanism(s) responsible for this effect, we determined ROS production, and glutathione (GSH) levels in living cells using the fluorescent probe (2',7'-dichlorofluorescein and monochlorobimane, respectively). Subcellular fractions were obtained from sonicated lymphocytes; cytosolic and membrane expression of PKC isoforms (alpha, and zeta) was evaluated after electrophoresis by immunoblot analysis. The results indicate that lead-exposed workers have significantly elevated levels of DNA breaks compared to the unexposed group. A multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that the most common confounding factors (smoking, drinking and age) have no synergistic effects with lead-exposure on the comet parameters or on GSH levels and ROS production. The logistic regression analysis distinguishing the exposed and non-exposed indicates that only GSH with tail moment are selected as significant risk factors. There is a significant positive correlation with ROS production and negative correlation with GSH levels. The content of PKC alpha in cytosol and membranes is decreased 40% (indicating a down-regulation of protein), whereas PKC zeta isoform is not modified in an evident manner. Our results suggest that lead-exposure induces an increase of DNA breakage with an alternate cellular redox state and a significant down-regulation of PKC alpha, suggesting that this metal may act as a tumor promoter.

11966400|t|The pharmacogenetics of NAT: structural aspects.
11966400|a|Arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs) catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to arylhydrazines and to arylamine drugs and carcinogens or to their N-hydroxylated metabolites. NAT plays an important role in detoxification and metabolic activation of xenobiotics and was first identified as the enzyme responsible for inactivation of the antitubercular drug isoniazid, an arylhydrazine. The rate of inactivation was polymorphically distributed in the population: the first example of interindividual pharmacogenetic variation. Polymorphism in NAT activity is primarily due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of NAT genes. NAT enzymes are widely distributed in eukaryotes and genome sequences have revealed many homologous members of this enzyme family in prokaryotes. The structures of S almonella typhimurium and Mycobacterium smegmatis NATs have been determined, revealing a unique fold in which a catalytic triad (Cys-His-Asp) forms the active site. Determination of prokaryotic and eukaryotic NAT structures could lead to a better understanding of their role in xenobiotics and endogenous metabolism.

11973627|t|Inherited and de novo mutations in sporadic cases of DYT1-dystonia.
11973627|a|A study of Danish probands with primary torsion dystonia is presented. The probands were examined clinically and biochemically to exclude secondary dystonia. Mutation analyses for the GAG-deletion in the DYT1 gene were performed on 107 probands; and the mutation was detected in three. All three probands had the classical phenotype of DYT1-dystonia, but only one had a family history of dystonia. The other two probands had, obviously, sporadic DYT1-dystonia, one of which was caused by a de novo mutation, while the other one had a parent being an asymptomatic carrier. De novo mutations in the DYT1 gene are seldom reported although independent founder mutations are known to have occurred. The frequency of DYT1-dystonia was low in our study even though several probands had early onset generalised dystonia. None of the probands in our study with other types of dystonia had the GAG-deletion as reported in other studies. The difficulties in genetic counselling concerning the heterogeneity of dystonia exemplified by DYT1-dystonia are outlined.

12007217|t|The IARC TP53 database: new online mutation analysis and recommendations to users.
12007217|a|Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are frequent in most human cancers. Comparison of the mutation patterns in different cancers may reveal clues on the natural history of the disease. Over the past 10 years, several databases of TP53 mutations have been developed. The most extensive of these databases is maintained and developed at the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The database compiles all mutations (somatic and inherited), as well as polymorphisms, that have been reported in the published literature since 1989. The IARC TP53 mutation dataset is the largest dataset available on the variations of any human gene. The database is available at www.iarc.fr/P53/. In this paper, we describe recent developments of the database. These developments include restructuring of the database, which is now patient-centered, with more detailed annotations on the patient (carcinogen exposure, virus infection, genetic background). In addition, a new on-line application to retrieve somatic mutation data and analyze mutation patterns is now available. We also discuss limitations on the use of the database and provide recommendations to users.

12052141|t|Human flavin-containing monooxygenase (form 3): polymorphisms and variations in chemical metabolism.
12052141|a|The human flavin-containing monooxygenases catalyze the oxygenation of nucleophilic heteroatom-containing drugs, xenobiotics and endogenous materials. Evidence for six forms of the FMO gene exist but it is FMO form 3 (FMO3) that is the prominent form in adult human liver that is likely to be associated with the bulk of FMO-mediated metabolism. An understanding of the substrate specificity of human FMO3 is beginning to emerge and several examples of drugs and chemicals extensively metabolized by FMO3 have been reported. Expression of FMO3 is species- and tissue-specific, but unlike human cytochrome P450 (CYP450), mammalian FMO3 does not appear to be inducible. Interindividual variation in FMO3-dependent metabolism of drugs, chemicals and endogenous materials is therefore more likely to be due to genetic and not environmental effects. Certain mutations of the human FMO3 gene have been associated with abnormal N-oxygenation of trimethylamine. Deficient N-oxygenation of trimethylamine results in a condition called trimethylaminuria. Some treatment strategies for this inborn error of metabolism are discussed. Other common variants of the FMO3 gene including E158K, V257M and E308G have been observed. It is possible that allelic variation of human FMO3 causes abnormal metabolism of chemicals and has clinical implications for human drug metabolism, but this is an understudied area. Human FMO3 allelic variation may eventually be shown to contribute to interindividual and interethnic variability in FMO3-mediated metabolism. Human FMO3 may be another example of an environmental gene that participates in a protective mechanism to help shield humans from potentially toxic exposure to chemicals. Heterogeneity in the relative frequencies of single and multiple site alleles, haplotypes and genotypes of the human FMO3 amongst various ethnic groups suggests population differences.

12205109|a|A large family with dominantly inherited rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, premature arthropathy, and development of phalangeal epiphyseal dysplasia, resulting in brachydactyly was linked to COL2A1, the gene encoding proalpha1(II) collagen. Mutational analysis of the gene by exon sequencing identified a novel mutation in the C-propeptide region of the molecule. The glycine to aspartic acid change occurred in a region that is highly conserved in all fibrillar collagen molecules. The resulting phenotype does not fit easily into pre-existing subgroups of the type II collagenopathies, which includes spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and the Kniest, Strudwick, and Stickler dysplasias.

12215838|t|Haplotype study of West European and North African Unverricht-Lundborg chromosomes: evidence for a few founder mutations.
12215838|a|Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) is a progressive myoclonus epilepsy common in Finland and North Africa, and less common in Western Europe. ULD is mostly caused by expansion of a dodecamer repeat in the cystatin B gene ( CSTB) promoter. We performed a haplotype study of ULD chromosomes (ULDc) with the repeat expansion. We included 48 West European Caucasian (WEC) and 47 North African (NA) ULDc. We analysed eight markers flanking CSTB(GT10-D21S1890-D21S1885-D21S2040-D21S1259- CSTB-D21S1912-PFKL-D21S171) and one intragenic variant in the CSTB 3' UTR (A2575G). We observed a founder effect in most of the NA ULD patients, as 61.7% of the NA ULDc (29/47) shared the same haplotype, A1 (1-1-A-1-6-7), for markers D21S1885-D21S2040-A2575G-D21S1259-D21S1912-PFKL. Moreover, if we considered only the markers D21S1885, D21S2040, A2575G and D21S1259, 43 of the 47 NA ULDc shared the same alleles 1-1-A-1, haplotype A. As previously shown, the WEC ULDc were heterogeneous. However, the Baltic haplotype, A3 (5-1-1-A-1-1), was observed in ten WEC ULDc (20.8%) and the CSTB 3'UTR variant, which we called the Alps variant, was observed in 17 ULDc (35.4%). Finally, as almost all NA patients, like Scandinavian patients, were of the haplotype A, we assumed that there was an ancient common founder effect in NA and Baltic ULD patients. We estimated that the putative most recent common ancestral ULD carrier with this haplotype A must have existed about 2,500 years ago (100-150 generations). Finally, this work provides evidence for the existence of only a small number of founder mutations in ULD.

12220456|t|Three novel mutations of the PKD1 gene in Korean patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
12220456|a|Mutations at the PKD1 locus account for 85% of cases of the common genetic disorder called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Screening for mutations of the PKD1 gene is complicated by the genomic structure of the 5'-duplicated region encoding 75% of the gene. To date, more than 90 mutations of the PKD1 gene have been reported in the European and American populations, and relatively little information is available concerning the pattern of mutations present in the Asian populations. We looked for mutations of the PKD1 gene in 51 unrelated Korean ADPKD patients, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primer pairs located in the 3' single-copy region of the PKD1 gene and by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. We found three novel mutations, a G to A substitution at nucleotide 11012 (G3601S), a C to A substitution at nucleotide 11312 (Q3701X), and a C to T substitution at nucleotide 12971 (P4254S), and a single polymorphism involving a G to C substitution at nucleotide 11470 (L3753L). These mutations were not found in control individuals, and no other mutations in the 3' single-copy region of the PKD1 gene of patients with these mutations were observed. In particular, P4254S segregated with the disease phenotype. The clinical data of affected individuals from this study, and of previously reported Korean PKD1 mutations, showed that patients with frameshift or nonsense mutations were more prone to develop end-stage renal failure than those with missense mutations. Our findings indicate that many different PKD1 mutations are likely to be responsible for ADPKD in the Korean population, as in the Western population.

12384774|t|Evidence for a founder effect for pseudoxanthoma elasticum in the Afrikaner population of South Africa.
12384774|a|Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a heritable elastic tissue disorder recently shown to be attributable to mutations in the ABCC6 ( MRP6) gene. Whereas PXE has been identified in all ethnic groups studied to date, the prevalence of this disease in various populations is uncertain, although often assumed to be similar. A notable exception however is the prevalence of PXE among South African Afrikaners. A previous report has suggested that a founder effect may explain the higher prevalence of PXE in Afrikaners, a European-derived population that first settled in South Africa in the 17th century. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed haplotype and mutational analysis of DNA from 24 South African families of Afrikaner, British and Indian descent. Among the 17 Afrikaner families studied, three common haplotypes and six different disease-causing variants were identified. Three of these mutant alleles were missense variants, two were nonsense mutations and one was a single base-pair insertion. The most common variant accounted for 53% of the PXE alleles, whereas other mutant alleles appeared at lower frequencies ranging from 3% to 12%. Haplotype analysis of the Afrikaner families showed that the three most frequent mutations were identical-by-descent, indicating a founder origin of PXE in this population.

12442272|t|D90A-SOD1 mediated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a single founder for all cases with evidence for a Cis-acting disease modifier in the recessive haplotype.
12442272|a|More than 100 different heterozygous mutations in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Uniquely, D90A-SOD1 has been identified in recessive, dominant and apparently sporadic pedigrees. The phenotype of homozygotes is stereotyped with an extended survival, whereas that of affected heterozygotes varies. The frequency of D90A-SOD1 is 50 times higher in Scandinavia (2.5%) than elsewhere, though ALS prevalence is not raised there. Our earlier study indicated separate founders for recessive and dominant/sporadic ALS and we proposed a disease-modifying factor linked to the recessive mutation. Here we have doubled our sample set and employed novel markers to characterise the mutation's origin and localise any modifying factor. Linkage disequilibrium analysis indicates that D90A homozygotes and heterozygotes share a rare haplotype and are all descended from a single ancient founder (alpha 0.974) c.895 generations ago. Homozygotes arose subsequently only c.63 generations ago (alpha 0.878). Recombination has reduced the region shared by recessive kindreds to 97-265 kb around SOD1, excluding all neighbouring genes. We propose that a cis-acting regulatory polymorphism has arisen close to D90A-SOD1 in the recessive founder, which decreases ALS susceptibility in heterozygotes and slows disease progression.

In this study, we define an SCN5A mutation, S1103Y, in a white family associated with syncope, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden death. A very recent study reported the same mutation in 13.2% of African Americans, but not in the white population. Our study shows that mutation S1103Y does exist in the white population, and it is associated with a considerable risk of syncope, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden death in this population.

12471593|t|Common sequence variants of the macrophage scavenger receptor 1 gene are associated with prostate cancer risk.
12471593|a|Rare germline mutations of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) gene were reported to be associated with prostate cancer risk in families with hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) and in patients with non-HPC (Xu et al. 2002). To further evaluate the role of MSR1 in prostate cancer susceptibility, at Johns Hopkins Hospital, we studied five common variants of MSR1 in 301 patients with non-HPC who underwent prostate cancer treatment and in 250 control subjects who participated in prostate cancer-screening programs and had normal digital rectal examination and PSA levels (<4 ng/ml). Significantly different allele frequencies between case subjects and control subjects were observed for each of the five variants (P value range.01-.04). Haplotype analyses provided consistent findings, with a significant difference in the haplotype frequencies from a global score test (P=.01). Because the haplotype that is associated with the increased risk for prostate cancer did not harbor any of the known rare mutations, it appears that the observed association of common variants and prostate cancer risk are independent of the effect of the known rare mutations. These results consistently suggest that MSR1 may play an important role in prostate carcinogenesis.

12749065|t|Subcortical band heterotopia with simplified gyral pattern and syndactyly.
12749065|a|We describe a girl with an unusual form of subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) and a complex malformation syndrome. SBH had an irregular inner margin, organized in contiguous fascicles of migrating neurons, sometimes giving the appearance of many small contiguous gyri. The true cortex had decreased thickness and showed a simplified gyral pattern with decreased number of gyri, which were usually of increased width, and shallow sulci. The cerebellum was hypoplastic. Additional features included epicanthal folds, hypertelorism, small nose with hypoplastic nares, bilateral syndactyly of the toes, pulmonary valve stenosis, atrial and ventricular septal defects. At the age of 1 year the patient had severe developmental delay and epilepsy. Chromosome studies and mutation analysis of the DCX and LIS1 genes gave negative results. This observation delineates a new multiple congenital abnormalities mental retardation syndrome and confirms genetic heterogeneity of SBH.

13679998|t|Lack of association between the G protein beta3 subunit gene and essential hypertension in Chinese: a case-control and a family-based study.
13679998|a|A C825T polymorphism of the gene encoding the G protein beta3 subunit (GNB3) is associated with enhanced G protein activity and increased intracellular signal transduction. The 825T allele has been implicated in the development of hypertension in some ethnic groups, especially in whites. Studies in Asians and blacks are more controversial, and little information is available on this polymorphism in the susceptibility to hypertension in the Chinese population. Furthermore, the inconsistency between studies may be due to genetic heterogeneity of the population selected and/or the lack of statistical power. We investigated the relationship of this polymorphism with hypertension in two independent northern Chinese populations using both a case-control and a family-based study design. The GNB3 C825T polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion. In the case-control study which included 585 hypertensive case subjects and 580 normotensive control subjects there was no significant association between the polymorphism and hypertension status or blood pressure levels. The lack of association was confirmed by the results obtained in 181 hypertensive families using both transmission disequilibrium test and sib transmission disequilibrium test. No preferential transmission was observed for the GNB3 825T allele to the affected subjects. Furthermore, there was no significant association between the polymorphism and body mass index in the case-control study. Therefore our work does not provide evidence in favor of GNB3 C825T being a candidate gene for conferring genetic susceptibility to hypertension or obesity in northern Chinese population.

14508509|t|Gene-gene interaction between the monoamine oxidase A gene and solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, noradrenalin) member 2 gene in anorexia nervosa (restrictive subtype).
14508509|a|We earlier found an association between anorexia nervosa (AN) restrictive subtype (AN-R) and an inserted sequence within the NETpPR, a polymorphic region located in the promoter of the solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, noradrenalin) member 2 (SLC6A2) gene. To further examine the noradrenergic system in AN-R we performed an association study with a functional polymorphism (MAOA-uVNTR) in the promoter of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene. Since monoamine oxidase A metabolises noradrenalin, a positive association with the MAOA gene would be biologically plausible. The transmission disequilibrium test and 95 trios/duos (AN-R females+biological parents) showed the main effect of the longer, more transcriptionally active form of the MAOA-uVNTR (MAOA-L) to be statistically non-significant (McNemar's chi(2)=1.4, df=1, P=0.238, odds ratio: 1.4, 95% CI 0.8-2.7). A case-control approach supported this finding. We then stratified the MAOA-uVNTR TDT data according to the (a) NETpPR genotype of the AN-R females, and (b) NETpPR allele transmitted from NETpPR-S4/L4 heterozygous mothers. In both cases, contingency table analysis revealed previously unreported gene-gene interaction between the MAOA and SLC6A2 genes (P=0.019 and 0.019, respectively). Receiving an MAOA-L allele more than doubles the risk for developing AN-R, conditional on an individual also being a NETpPR-L4 homozygote (stratum-specific odds ratio: 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-6.0). These results suggest important involvement of the noradrenergic system in the biological underpinnings of AN-R.

14571269|t|Evidence for a QTL on chromosome 19 influencing LDL cholesterol levels in the general population.
14571269|a|The genetic basis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with its complex etiology is still largely elusive. Plasma levels of lipids and apolipoproteins are among the major quantitative risk factors for CVD and are well-established intermediate traits that may be more accessible to genetic dissection than clinical CVD end points. Chromosome 19 harbors multiple genes that have been suggested to play a role in lipid metabolism and previous studies indicated the presence of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for cholesterol levels in genetic isolates. To establish the relevance of genetic variation at chromosome 19 for plasma levels of lipids and apolipoproteins in the general, out-bred Caucasian population, we performed a linkage study in four independent samples, including adolescent Dutch twins and adult Dutch, Swedish and Australian twins totaling 493 dizygotic twin pairs. The average spacing of short-tandem-repeat markers was 6-8 cM. In the three adult twin samples, we found consistent evidence for linkage of chromosome 19 with LDL cholesterol levels (maximum LOD scores of 4.5, 1.7 and 2.1 in the Dutch, Swedish and Australian sample, respectively); no indication for linkage was observed in the adolescent Dutch twin sample. The QTL effects in the three adult samples were not significantly different and a simultaneous analysis of the samples increased the maximum LOD score to 5.7 at 60 cM pter. Bivariate analyses indicated that the putative LDL-C QTL also contributed to the variance in ApoB levels, consistent with the high genetic correlation between these phenotypes. Our study provides strong evidence for the presence of a QTL on chromosome 19 with a major effect on LDL-C plasma levels in outbred Caucasian populations.

14610350|t|A 3.4-kbp transcript of ZNF331 is solely expressed in follicular thyroid adenomas.
14610350|a|Translocations involving chromosomal region 19q13 are a frequent finding in follicular adenomas of the thyroid and might represent the most frequent type of structural aberration in human epithelial tumors. By positional cloning, a putative candidate gene, ZNF331 (formerly RITA) located close to the breakpoint was identified. Recently, aberrant expression of ZNF331 has been described in two cell lines of follicular thyroid adenomas with aberrations in 19q13 indicating an involvement of ZNF331 in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, knowledge about structure and expression of ZNF331 is limited. We performed RACE-PCR and genomic sequence analyses to gain a deeper insight into its molecular structure. To elucidate ZNF331 expression patterns we performed Northern blot analyses on various normal tissues as well as on thyroid carcinoma and adenoma cell lines. Herein, unique expression of a 3.4-kbp transcript is described in thyroid adenoma cell lines with 19q13 aberrations, which was not detected either in normal tissues or in thyroid carcinoma cell lines.

14613971|t|Developmentally-programmed FMRP expression in oligodendrocytes: a potential role of FMRP in regulating translation in oligodendroglia progenitors.
14613971|a|The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is a selective RNA-binding protein whose function is implicated in regulating protein synthesis of its mRNA targets. The lack of FMRP leads to abnormal synapse development in the brain and impaired learning/memory. Although FMRP is predominantly expressed in neurons of the adult brain, whether FMRP also functions in glia during early development remains elusive, since expression of FMRP in glia has not been rigorously examined. This is an important question because recent studies revealed important roles of glia in synaptic development. Here we report that in addition to the observed neuronal expression, FMRP expression is detected in oligodendroglia progenitor cells (OPCs), immature oligodendrocytes and oligodendroglia cell lines, where it interacts with a subgroup of oligodendrocyte-specific mRNAs, including the myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNA. FMRP expression gradually declines as oligodendrocytes differentiate in vitro and in the developing brain. The decline of FMRP expression during oligodendrocyte differentiation is associated with a vigorous up-regulation of the MBP protein. In addition, we show that the MBP 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) is necessary and sufficient for binding FMRP, and mediates translation inhibition of a reporter gene by FMRP specifically in oligodendrocytes. These results support the hypothesis that FMRP may participate in regulating translation of its bound mRNAs in oligodendroglia during early brain development.

14644354|t|Propofol anesthesia in children does not induce sister chromatid exchanges in lymphocytes.
14644354|a|BACKGROUND: Propofol is frequently used for general anesthesia in children although little is known about possible genotoxic effects in humans. We investigated the formation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in metaphase chromosomes of T-lymphocytes of children as a marker for possible genotoxocity following total intravenous anesthesia with propofol for minor surgical procedures. METHODS: 40 children ASA classification I-III were included (ASA I n=34, ASA II n=5, ASA III n=1) in the study. Anesthesia was induced by propofol (3mg/kg) and alfentanil. Succinylcholine or rocuronium were administered for muscle relaxation. After tracheal intubation anesthesia was maintained by continuous propofol infusion at 12 mg/(kgh). Blood samples were drawn before induction and after termination of anesthesia. Following a 72 h cell culture period, 25 T-lymphocyte metaphases per blood sample for all children were analyzed for SCE frequencies. RESULTS: Total intravenous anesthesia with propofol on children did not influence SCE rates in metaphase chromosomes of T-lymphocytes. No SCE differences could be detected between blood samples before initiation and after termination of anesthesia (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Slightly elevated SCE rates were obtained in T-lymphocytes of girls compared to boys, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol anesthesia under the chosen conditions did not induce the formation of SCE in children in vivo. No genotoxic effect of a short term exposure to propofol during pediatric anesthesia had been observed.

14722915|t|Y-chromosomal microsatellite mutation rates: differences in mutation rate between and within loci.
14722915|a|Precise estimates of mutation rates at Y-chromosomal microsatellite STR (short tandem repeat) loci make an important basis for paternity diagnostics and dating of Y chromosome lineage origins. There are indications of considerable locus mutation rate variability between (inter-) and within (intra-) loci. We have studied nine Y-STR loci-DYS19, DYS389I/II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS385, and DYS388-in 1,766 father-son pairs of confirmed paternity (a total of 15,894 meioses). Five biallelic markers were also analyzed in the fathers-Tat, YAP, 12f2, SRY1532, and 92R7-defining haplogroups 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 16, respectively. A total of 36 fragment length mutations were observed: 24 gains (22 single-step, two double-step) and 12 single-step losses. Thus, there was a significant surplus of gains (p=0.045). Overall, the mutation rate was positively correlated to STR repeat length and there was a significant relative excess of losses in long alleles and gains in short alleles (p=0.043). In contrast to the situation in autosomal STR loci and in MSY-1, no noteworthy correlation between mutation rate and the father's age at the child's birth was observed. We observed significant interlocus differences in Y-STR mutation rates (p<0.01). The number of observed mutations ranged from zero in DYS392 to eight in DYS391 and DYS390. We have also demonstrated obvious differences in mutation rates between the haplogroups studied (p=0.024), a phenomenon that is a reflection of the dependence of mutation rate on allele size. Our study has thus demonstrated the necessity of not only locus-specific, but even allele-specific, mutation rate estimates for forensic and population genetic purposes, and provides a considerable basis for such estimates.

14722929|t|Low frequency of deafness-associated GJB2 variants in Kenya and Sudan and novel GJB2 variants.
14722929|a|A large proportion of non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness (NSARD) in many populations is caused by variants of the GJB2 gene. Here, the frequency of GJB2 variants was studied in 406 and 183 apparently unrelated children from Kenya and Sudan, respectively, with mostly severe to profound non-syndromic deafness. Nine (2.2 %) Kenyan and 12 (6.6 %) of the Sudanese children only were carriers of variants within the coding sequence of the GJB2 gene. Variants in the 5'-adjacent region were detected in further 115 individuals. A total of 10 novel variants was recognized, among them four variants in the adjacent 5'-region of the GJB2 coding exon 2 (g.3318-6T>A, g.3318-15C>T, g.3318-34C>T, g.3318-35T>G), a 6 base-pair deletion (g.3455_3460del [p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu]), a variant leading to a stop codon (g.3512C>A [p.Tyr65X]), synonymous variants (g.3395C>T [p.Thr26], g.3503C>T [p.Asn62], g.3627A>C [p.Arg104]), and one non-synonymous variant (g.3816C>A [p.Val167Met]). In addition, the previously described variants g.3352delG (commonly designated 30delG or 35 delG), g.3426G>A [p.Val37Ile], g.3697G>A [p.Arg127His], g.3774G>A [p.Val153Ile], and g.3795G>A [p.Gly160Ser] were identified. With the exception of g.3318-34C>T and g.3352delG, all variants occurred heterozygously. For most of the variants identified in the Kenyan and Sudanese study population, a causative association with NSARD appears to be unlikely. Compared to many other ethnic groups, deafness-associated variants of the coding region of GJB2 are rare in Sudan and Kenya, suggesting a role of other genetic, or epigenetic factors as a cause for deafness in these countries.

14755448|t|Clinical features of psychotic disorders and polymorphisms in HT2A, DRD2, DRD4, SLC6A3 (DAT1), and BDNF: a family based association study.
14755448|a|Schizophrenia is clinically heterogeneous and multidimensional, but it is not known whether this is due to etiological heterogeneity. Previous studies have not consistently reported association between any specific polymorphisms and clinical features of schizophrenia, and have primarily used case-control designs. We tested for the presence of association between clinical features and polymorphisms in the genes for the serotonin 2A receptor (HT2A), dopamine receptor types 2 and 4, dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Two hundred seventy pedigrees were ascertained on the basis of having two or more members with schizophrenia or poor outcome schizoaffective disorder. Diagnoses were made using a structured interview based on the SCID. All patients were rated on the major symptoms of schizophrenia scale (MSSS), integrating clinical and course features throughout the course of illness. Factor analysis revealed positive, negative, and affective symptom factors. The program QTDT was used to implement a family-based test of association for quantitative traits, controlling for age and sex. We found suggestive evidence of association between the His452Tyr polymorphism in HT2A and affective symptoms (P = 0.02), the 172-bp allele of BDNF and negative symptoms (P = 0.04), and the 480-bp allele in SLC6A3 (= DAT1) and negative symptoms (P = 0.04). As total of 19 alleles were tested, we cannot rule out false positives. However, given prior evidence of involvement of the proteins encoded by these genes in psychopathology, our results suggest that more attention should be focused on the impact of these alleles on clinical features of schizophrenia.

14976162|t|Genomic evidence for recent positive selection at the human MDR1 gene locus.
14976162|a|The MDR1 multidrug transporter regulates the traffic of drugs, peptides and xenobiotics into the body as well as sensitive tissues like the brain, germ cells and the developing fetus. Hence, it may influence an individual's response to drugs as well as his/her susceptibility to complex diseases in which environmental factors, especially xenobiotics, play a role. Polymorphisms within this gene, especially single-nucleotide polymorphism e26/3435(C/T), have been variously associated with differences in MDR1 expression, function, drug response and disease susceptibility. Here, we report the detailed characterization of the haplotype and linkage disequilibrium architecture of the entire 200 kb of the MDR1 gene in five world populations, namely, Chinese, Malays, Indians, Caucasians and African-Americans. We observed varied haplotype diversity across the entire gene in the different populations. The major haplotype mh5, which contains the subhaplotype e12/1236T-e21/2677T-e26/3435T, is highly represented among the four non-African populations, while mh7, which contains the subhaplotype e12/1236C-e21/2677G-e26/3435C, accounts for over a third of African-American chromosomes. These observations are inconsistent with a simple population evolution model, but instead are suggestive of recent historical events that have maintained such long range linkage disequilibrium. Using a modified long-range haplotype test, we found statistically significant evidence of recent positive selection for the e21/2677T and e26/3435T alleles in the Chinese population, and for the e26/3435T allele in the Malay population. Interestingly, we also detected evidence for positive selection of the alternative allele e26/3435C in the African-American population. These data suggest that independent mutational events may have occurred on the mh5 and mh7 haplotypes of the MDR1 gene to confer positive selection in the non-African and African-American populations, respectively.

15099351|a|Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is at a locus for autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, and recent data indicate that the PCSK9 gene is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis.

In this study, DNA sequencing of the 12 exons of the PCSK9 gene has been performed in 51 Norwegian subjects with a clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia where mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene and mutation R3500Q in the apolipoprotein B-100 gene had been excluded. Two novel missense mutations were detected in the catalytic subdomain of the PCSK9 gene. Two patients were heterozygotes for D374Y, and one patient was a double heterozygote for D374Y and N157K. D374Y segregated with hypercholesterolemia in the two former families where family members were available for study. Our findings support the notion that mutations in the PCSK9 gene cause autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia.

15106122|t|Disruption of contactin 4 (CNTN4) results in developmental delay and other features of 3p deletion syndrome.
15106122|a|3p deletion syndrome is a rare contiguous-gene disorder involving the loss of the telomeric portion of the short arm of chromosome 3 and characterized by developmental delay, growth retardation, and dysmorphic features. All reported cases have involved, at a minimum, the deletion of chromosome 3 telomeric to the band 3p25.3. Despite the presence of several genes in this region that are involved in neural development, a causative relationship between a particular transcript and the observed clinical manifestations has remained elusive. We have identified a child with characteristic physical features of 3p deletion syndrome and both verbal and nonverbal developmental delay who carries a de novo balanced translocation involving chromosomes 3 and 10. Fine mapping of this rearrangement demonstrates that the translocation breakpoint on chromosome 3 falls within the recently identified minimal candidate region for 3p deletion syndrome and disrupts the Contactin 4 (CNTN4) mRNA transcript at 3p26.2-3p26.3. This transcript (also known as BIG-2) is a member of the immunoglobulin super family of neuronal cell adhesion molecules involved in axon growth, guidance, and fasciculation in the central nervous system (CNS). Our results demonstrate the association of CNTN4 disruption with the 3p deletion syndrome phenotype and strongly suggest a causal relationship. These findings point to an important role for CNTN4 in normal and abnormal CNS development.

15116316|t|Offspring gender ratio and the rate of recurrent spontaneous miscarriages in jewish women at high risk for breast/ovarian cancer.
15116316|a|BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations are associated with an increased breast/ovarian cancer risk. Offspring gender ratios may be skewed against male births in BRCA1 mutation carriers. In addition, the lack of viable homozygous BRCA1/BRCA2-mutation carriers implies that recurrent miscarriages may be associated with homozygous fetuses. Jewish Israeli high-risk women who were tested for being carriers of the predominant BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in Jewish high-risk families were analyzed for the sex of offspring and the rate of spontaneous miscarriages. Overall, 817 women participated: 393 BRCA1/BRCA2-mutation carriers (229 with breast/ovarian cancer) and 424 high-risk noncarriers (208 with breast/ovarian cancer). No differences between the male-to-female offspring ratios of all study groups were noted. Among mutation carriers, the offspring male-to-female ratio was 0.97 (444 : 460), and among mutation carriers with cancer it was 0.92 (262 : 284). Similarly, no offspring gender skewing was noted among high-risk noncarriers, regardless of health status. The rates of three or more spontaneous miscarriages among participants with at least one live birth were 4.37% (15/343) among mutation carriers and 3% (12/401) among high-risk women (P = not significant). In conclusion, the offspring gender ratio is similar in high-risk Jewish families and in the general population. The issue of the rate of recurrent miscarriages in high-risk Jewish women is unresolved.

15128701|t|Corticosteroid pharmacogenetics: association of sequence variants in CRHR1 with improved lung function in asthmatics treated with inhaled corticosteroids.
15128701|a|Corticosteroids mediate a variety of immunological actions and are commonly utilized in the treatment of a wide range of diseases. Unfortunately, therapy with this class of medications is associated with a large proportion of non-responders and significant side effects. Inhaled corticosteroids are the most commonly used asthma controller therapy. However, asthmatic response to corticosteroids also varies widely between individuals. We investigated the genetic contribution to the variation in response to inhaled corticosteroid therapy in asthma. The association of longitudinal change in lung function and single nucleotide polymorphisms from candidate genes crucial to the biologic actions of corticosteroids were evaluated in three independent asthmatic clinical trial populations utilizing inhaled corticosteroids as the primary therapy in at least one treatment arm. Variation in one gene, corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) was consistently associated with enhanced response to therapy in each of our three populations. Individuals homozygous for the variants of interest manifested a doubling to quadrupling of the lung function response to corticosteroids compared with lack of the variants (P-values ranging from 0.006 to 0.025 for our three asthmatic populations). As the primary receptor mediating the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone, which regulates endogenous cortisol levels, CRHR1 plays a pivotal, pleiotropic role in steroid biology. These data indicate that genetic variants in CRHR1 have pharmacogenetic effects influencing asthmatic response to corticosteroids, provide a rationale for predicting therapeutic response in asthma and other corticosteroid-treated diseases, and suggests this gene pathway as a potential novel therapeutic target.

15241479|t|A double cryptic chromosome imbalance is an important factor to explain phenotypic variability in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.
15241479|a|A total of five Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) patient with a 4p16.3 de novo microdeletion was referred because of genotype-phenotype inconsistencies, first explained as phenotypic variability of the WHS. The actual deletion size was found to be about 12 Mb in three patients, 5 Mb in another one and 20 Mb in the last one, leading us to hypothesize the presence of an extrachromosome segment on the deleted 4p. A der(4)(4qter --> p16.1::8p23 --> pter) chromosome, resulting from an unbalanced de novo translocation was, in fact, detected in four patients and a der(4)(4qter --> q32::4p15.3 --> qter) in the last. Unbalanced t(4;8) translocations were maternal in origin, the rec(4p;4q) was paternal. With the purpose of verifying frequency and specificity of this phenomenon, we investigated yet another group of 20 WHS patients with de novo large deletions (n = 13) or microdeletions (n = 7) and with apparently straightforward genotype-phenotype correlations. The rearrangement was paternal in origin, and occurred as a single anomaly in 19 out of 20 patients. In the remaining patient, the deleted chromosome 4 was maternally derived and consisted of a der(4)(4qter --> 4p16.3::8p23 --> 8pter). In conclusions, we observed that 20% (5/25) of de novo WHS-associated rearrangements were maternal in origin and 80% (20/25) were paternal. All the maternally derived rearrangements were de novo unbalanced t(4;8) translocations and showed specific clinical phenotypes. Paternally derived rearrangements were usually isolated deletions. It can be inferred that a double, cryptic chromosome imbalance is an important factor for phenotypic variability in WHS. It acts either by masking the actual deletion size or by doubling a quantitative change of the genome.

15241482|t|Paraoxonase 1 polymorphisms and survival.
15241482|a|The antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) has previously been suggested to confer protection against coronary heart disease (CHD), one of the main causes of death in the Western world. Two coding polymorphisms, 55M/L and 192Q/R, and a promoter variant, -107C/T, has been extensively studied with respect to susceptibility to CHD. In this study, we have investigated the impact of these three polymorphisms on mortality using a sample of 1932 Danish individuals aged 47-93 years, previously used in gene-longevity studies. A cross-sectional study comparing the genotype distribution of the three polymorphisms separately as well as the haplotype distribution in different age groups did not reveal any difference. However, a longitudinal follow-up study on survival in the same sample indicated that 192RR homozygotes have a poorer survival compared to QQ homozygotes (hazard rate: 1.38, P = 0.04). We hereafter used an independent sample of 541 Danish individuals from the oldest cohort and confirmed the initial findings (hazard rate: 1.38, P = 0.09). In both samples, the effect was most pronounced in women. Using self-reported data on ischemic heart disease to evaluate the impact of the PON 192Q/R polymorphism on susceptibility to CHD, we found only a nonsignificant trend of 192RR homozygosity in women being a risk factor. Our results thus indicates that PON1 192RR homozygosity is associated with increased mortality in women in the second half of life and that this increased mortality is possibly related to CHD severity and survival after CHD rather than susceptibility to development of CHD.

15252723|t|Trisomy 1 in a case of a missed abortion.
15252723|a|Most chromosomal trisomies lead to miscarriages. In all trisomies, trisomy 1 is the most rare case. We herein present a patient who demonstrated a gestational sac and a yolk sac on transvaginal ultrasound. However, at 53 days of gestation, the pregnancy was lost with a diagnosis of a blighted ovum. A D_C was recommended and performed. A cytogenetic analysis from chorionic villi demonstrated a 47,XX,+1 chromosome complement in all 100 cells. Regarding full trisomy 1, there has only been one case report of a preembryo and two case reports in a clinically recognized pregnancy to date.

15371903|t|CFTR mutation distribution among U.S. Hispanic and African American individuals: evaluation in cystic fibrosis patient and carrier screening populations.
15371903|a|PURPOSE: We reviewed CFTR mutation distribution among Hispanic and African American individuals referred for CF carrier screening and compared mutation frequencies to those derived from CF patient samples. METHODS: Results from CFTR mutation analyses received from January 2001 through September 2003, were analyzed for four populations: Hispanic individuals with a CF diagnosis (n = 159) or carrier screening indication (n = 15,333) and African American individuals with a CF diagnosis (n = 108) or carrier screening indication (n = 8,973). All samples were tested for the same 87 mutation panel. RESULTS: In the Hispanic population, 42 mutations were identified: 30 in the patient population (77.5% detection rate) and 33 among carrier screening referrals. Five mutations not included in the ACMG/ACOG carrier screening panel (3876delA, W1089X, R1066C, S549N, 1949del84) accounted for 7.55% detection in patients and 5.58% among carriers. Among African American referrals, 33 different mutations were identified: 21 in the patient population (74.4% detection) and 23 in the carrier screening population. Together, A559T and 711+5G>A were observed at a detection rate of 3.71% in CF patients and 6.38% in carriers. The mutation distribution seen in both the carrier screening populations reflected an increased frequency of mutations with variable expression such as D1152H, R117H, and L206W. CONCLUSIONS: A detailed analysis of CFTR mutation distribution in the Hispanic and African American patient and carrier screening populations demonstrates that a diverse group of mutations is most appropriate for diagnostic and carrier screening in these populations. To best serve the increasingly diverse U.S. population, ethnic-specific mutations should be included in mutation panels.

15459975|t|Fine mapping and identification of a candidate gene SSH1 in disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis.
15459975|a|Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is an uncommon autosomal dominant chronic keratinization disorder, characterized by multiple superficial keratotic lesions surrounded by a slightly raised keratotic border. Thus far, although two loci for DSAP have been identified, the genetic basis and pathogenesis of this disorder have not been elucidated yet. In this study, we performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in three Chinese affected families and localized the gene in an 8.0 cM interval defined by D12S330 and D12S354 on chromosome 12. Upon screening 30 candidate genes, we identified a missense mutation, p.Ser63Asn in SSH1 in one family, a frameshift mutation, p.Ser19CysfsX24 in an alternative variant (isoform f) of SSH1 in another family, and a frameshift mutation, p.Pro27ProfsX54 in the same alternative variant in one non-familial case with DSAP. SSH1 encodes a phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in actin dynamics. Our data suggested that cytoskeleton disorganization in epidermal cells is likely associated with the pathogenesis of DSAP.

15480879|t|Alternative splicing in the N-terminus of Alzheimer's presenilin 1.
15480879|a|Presenilin 1 (PS1) is mutated in the majority of familial cases of Alzheimer disease (AD). Although it is clear that PS1 is involved in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the exact function of PS1 is still elusive. Human presenilin 1 (PS1) is alternatively spliced, resulting in the presence or absence of a four-amino acid motif, VRSQ, in the PS1 N-terminus. In human tissues, both isoforms are expressed. Here we report that mouse and rat only express the longer PS1 isoform. The presence of this motif introduces a potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase C. Because the splice occurs in the region of PS1 that we have previously shown to bind to rabGDI, this might provide a regulatory mechanism for this interaction. Our data show that the -VRSQ isoform binds rabGDI, but the +VRSQ does not. Moreover, mutation of the putatively phosphorylated threonine in PS1 disrupts the binding to rabGDI, showing its importance for the interaction. To our knowledge this is the first study showing a functional difference between PS1 splice variants. The possible consequences for APP processing and the pathogenesis of AD are discussed.

15523499|t|Haplotype structure of the beta adrenergic receptor genes in US Caucasians and African Americans.
15523499|a|The beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) are G protein-coupled receptors activated by epinephrine and norepinephrine and are involved in a variety of their physiological functions. Previously, three beta-AR genes (ADRB1, ADRB2 and ADRB3) were resequenced, identifying polymorphisms that were used in genetic association studies of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. These studies have produced intriguing but inconsistent results, potentially because the known functional variants: ADRB1 Arg389Gly and Gly49Ser, ADRB2 Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, and ADRB3 Arg64Trp provided an incomplete picture of the total functional diversity at these genes. Therefore, we created marker panels for each beta-AR gene that included the known functional markers and also other markers evenly spaced and with sufficient density to identify haplotype block structure and to maximize haplotype diversity. A total of 27 markers were genotyped in 96 US Caucasians and 96 African Americans. In both populations and for each gene, a single block with little evidence of historical recombination was observed. For each gene, haplotype captured most of the information content of each functional locus, even if that locus was not genotyped, and presumably haplotype would capture the signal from unknown functional loci whose alleles are of moderate abundance. This study demonstrates the utility of using beta-AR gene haplotype maps and marker panels as tools for linkage studies on beta-AR function.

15530539|t|Cis-acting transmission of genomic instability.
15530539|a|Genomic instability is a highly pleiotropic phenotype, which may reflect a variety of underlying mechanisms. Destabilization has been shown in some cases to involve mutational alteration or inactivation of trans-acting cellular factors, for example, p53 or mismatch repair functions. However, aspects of instability are not well explained by mutational inactivation of trans-acting factors, and other epigenetic and cis-acting mechanisms have recently been proposed. The trans and cis models result in divergent predictions for the distribution of instability-associated genetic alterations within the genome, and for the inheritance of genomic instability among sibling sub-clones of unstable parents. These predictions have been tested in this study primarily by tracking the karyotypic distribution of chromosomal rearrangements in clones and sub-clones exhibiting radiation-induced genomic instability; inheritance of mutator phenotypes was also analyzed. The results indicate that genomic instability is unevenly transmitted to sibling sub-clones, that chromosomal rearrangements within unstable clones are non-randomly distributed throughout the karyotype, and that the majority of chromosomal rearrangements associated with instability affect trisomic chromosomal segments. Observations of instability in trisomic regions suggests that in addition to promoting further alterations in chromosomal number, aneuploidy can affect the recovery of structural rearrangements. In summary, these findings cannot be fully explained by invoking a homogeneously distributed factor acting in trans, but do provide support for previous suggestions that genomic instability may in part be driven by a cis-acting mechanism.

15583840|t|Tumor associated antigen recognition by autologous serum in patients with breast cancer.
15583840|a|Breast cancer accounts for 30-40% of all deaths from cancers in females. In an effort to identify tumor associated antigens that may be useful for immunotherapy, we utilized serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) technique to identify breast cancer-associated antigens. SEREX screening of cDNA expression libraries derived from 3 breast cancer patients identified a total of 88 positive clones (bcg-1 to bcg-88), including 27 hitherto unknown sequences. The cDNA sequences and mRNA expression patterns were characterized. Seroreactivity of the SEREX clones were determined in sera from 75 breast cancer patients, 75 colon cancer patients, and 25 healthy donors. Expression analysis on a cDNA panel from 17 different normal tissues by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed tissue restricted mRNA expression of 2 of the 27 unknown antigens. Bcg-72 is expressed only in breast, prostate and thymus, while bcg-84 is expressed at moderate levels in testis, spleen and breast. The other 25 unknown antigens were expressed in most other tissues. Serologic assay revealed that 7 out of the 88 clones showed reactivity to at least one serum from either 75 breast or 75 colon cancer patients. These clones did not react with sera from a panel of 25 healthy adult individuals. Our results demonstrate the utility of the SEREX approach for the identification of potential tumor associated antigens in human breast cancer.

15689448|t|Automated genomic sequence analysis of the three collagen VI genes: applications to Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy.
15689448|a|INTRODUCTION: Mutations in the genes encoding collagen VI (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) cause Bethlem myopathy (BM) and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD). BM is a relatively mild dominantly inherited disorder with proximal weakness and distal joint contractures. UCMD is an autosomal recessive condition causing severe muscle weakness with proximal joint contractures and distal hyperlaxity. METHODS: We developed a method for rapid direct sequence analysis of all 107 coding exons of the COL6 genes using single condition amplification/internal primer (SCAIP) sequencing. We have sequenced all three COL6 genes from genomic DNA in 79 patients with UCMD or BM. RESULTS: We found putative mutations in one of the COL6 genes in 62% of patients. This more than doubles the number of identified COL6 mutations. Most of these changes are consistent with straightforward autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance. However, some patients showed changes in more than one of the COL6 genes, and our results suggest that some UCMD patients may have dominantly acting mutations rather than recessive disease. DISCUSSION: Our findings may explain some or all of the cases of UCMD that are unlinked to the COL6 loci under a recessive model. The large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms which we generated in the course of this work may be of importance in determining the major phenotypic variability seen in this group of disorders.

15748645|t|Photochemoprevention of ultraviolet B signaling and photocarcinogenesis.
15748645|a|Exposure to solar radiation, particularly its ultraviolet (UV) B component, has a variety of harmful effects on human health. Some of these effects include sunburn cell formation, basal and squamous cell cancers, melanoma, cataracts, photoaging of the skin, and immune suppression. Amongst these various adverse effects of UV radiation, skin cancer is of the greatest concern. Over the years, changes in lifestyle has led to a significant increase in the amount of UV radiation that people receive, and this consequently has led to a surge in the incidence of skin cancer. The development of skin cancer is a complex multistage phenomenon involving three distinct stages exemplified by initiation, promotion and progression stages. Each of these stages is mediated via alterations in various cellular, biochemical, and molecular changes. Initiation, the first step in the carcinogenesis process is essentially an irreversible step in which genetic alterations occur in genes that ultimately leads to DNA modification and fixation of mutation. Tumor promotion is the essential process in cancer development involving clonal expansion of initiated cells giving rise to pre-malignant and then to malignant lesions, essentially by alterations in signal transduction pathways. Tumor progression involves the conversion of pre-malignant and malignant lesions into an invasive and potentially metastatic malignant tumor. All these processes for skin cancer development involve stimulation of DNA synthesis, DNA damage and proliferation, inflammation, immunosuppression, epidermal hyperplasia, cell cycle dysregulation, depletion of antioxidant defenses, impairment of signal transduction pathways, induction of cyclooxygenase, increase in prostaglandin synthesis, and induction of ornithine decarboxylase. Photochemoprevention has been appreciated as a viable approach to reduce the occurrence of skin cancer and in recent years, the use of agents, especially botanical antioxidants, present in the common diet and beverages consumed by human population have gained considerable attention as photochemopreventive agents for human use. Many such agents have also found a place in skin care products. Although this is more common in oriental countries, its popularity is significantly growing in western countries. In this article, we have summarized the available information of laboratory studies on UVB-mediated signaling that can be exploited as targets for photochemoprevention. We suggest that the use of skin care products supplemented with proven chemopreventive agents in conjunction with the use of sunscreens along with educational efforts may be an effective strategy for reducing UV-induced photodamage and skin cancer in humans. The mechanistic basis for the use of such products is discussed.

15823919|t|Molecular genetic and ocular findings in patients with holt-oram syndrome.
15823919|a|PURPOSE: The autosomal dominant Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is characterized by upper limb and cardiac septal defects. Mutations of the TBX5 gene have been identified as the underlying gene defect in HOS. Embryonic expression of TBX5 has been found in the human retina. This is the first report of ocular findings in two unrelated families with mutations in the TBX5 gene. METHODS: Six living persons affected with HOS and 10 unaffected family members were subjected to mutation analysis and complete ophthalmological examination, including electrophysiological examinations (EOG and flash ERG). RESULTS: A heterozygous single base-pain substitution in exon 5 (408C --> A) was detected in all affected patients. All examined affected patents were ophthalmological asymptomatic with normal EOG. A scotopic elongated b-wave latency was found in affected family members who were older than 35 years. The ERG was normal in the young patients. CONCLUSIONS: Haploinsufficiency of TBX5 alters the dorsal-ventral polarity in developing eye vesicles without amy detected functional loss in human. Slight ERG abnormalities later in life may be a result of changes induced by the inner ganglion cell layer in the inner nuclear layer.

15834508|t|Low RET mutation frequency and polymorphism analysis of the RET and EDNRB genes in patients with Hirschsprung disease in Taiwan.
15834508|a|Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital intestinal aganglionosis, is a relatively common disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the nerve plexuses of the lower digestive tract, resulting in intestinal obstruction in neonates. Mutations in genes of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) signaling pathways have been shown to be associated in HSCR patients. In this study, we collected genomic DNA samples from 55 HSCR patients in central Taiwan and analyzed the coding regions of the RET and EDNRB genes by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. In the 55 patients, an A to G transition was detected in two (identical twin brothers). The mutation was at the end of RET exon 19 at codon 1062 (Y1062C), a reported critical site for the signaling pathways. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in exons 2, 7, 11, 13, and 15 of RET and exon 4 of EDNRB in the HSCR patients or controls were detected. The differences between patients and controls in allele distribution of the five RET polymorphic sites were statistically significant. The most frequent genotype encompassing exons 2 and 13 SNPs (the polymorphic sites with the highest percentage of heterozygotes) was AA/GG in patients, which was different from the AG/GT in the normal controls. Transmission disequilibrium was observed in exons 2, 7, and 13, indicating nonrandom association of the susceptibility alleles with the disease in the patients. This study represents the first comprehensive genetic analysis of HSCR disease in Taiwan.

15838180|t|Superimposing polymorphism: the case of a point mutation within a polymorphic Alu insertion.
15838180|a|The COL3A1 Alu insertion is a member of the AluY subfamily. It has been found to be absent in non-human primates and polymorphic in worldwide human populations. The integration of the element into the human genome seems to have preceded the initial migration(s) of anatomically modern humans out of the African continent. Although the insertion has been detected in populations from all the continents, its highest frequency values are located within sub-Saharan Africa. The sequence alignment of the COL3A1 insertion from several African individuals revealed a bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the downstream terminus of the element's poly-A tract. Once discovered, a selective PCR procedure was designed to determine the frequency of both alleles in 19 worldwide populations. The A-allele in this binary SNP experiences a clinal increase in the eastward direction from Africa to Southeast Asia and Mongolia, reaching fixation in the two latter regions. The T variant, on the other hand, exhibits a westward clinal increase outside of Africa, with its lowest frequency in Asia and achieving fixation in northern Europe. The presence of this internal SNP extends the usefulness provided by the polymorphic Alu insertion (PAI). It is possible that superimposing polymorphisms like this one found in the COL3A1 locus may accentuate signals from genetic drift events allowing for visualization of recent dispersal patterns.

15860362|t|Burkitt-type acute leukemia in a patient with B-prolymphocytic leukemia: evidence for a common origin.
15860362|a|Burkitt-type acute leukemia cells were present in the bone marrow of a patient with B-prolymphocytic leukemia diagnosed from peripheral blood cell morphology. Immunophenotype analysis confirmed morphological patterns. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed an identical t(8;22)(q24;q21) with MYC locus rearrangement in blood and bone marrow cells, with additional chromosome abnormalities in the bone marrow. In addition, the loss of one copy of the TP53 gene and identical IGH DNA clonal rearrangements were shown with FISH and polymerase chain reaction analysis respectively in the two types of leukemic cells. These data indicated the common origin of the two coexisting leukemias and are the first example of such occurrence in a leukemic patient.

15864130|t|Haplotypes of variants in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase1A9 and 1A1 genes.
15864130|a|OBJECTIVES: Nine different functional UGT1A enzymes are generated from a single UGT1A gene by alternative splicing, with each enzyme having a unique exon 1. SN-38, the active metabolite of the anticancer agent irinotecan, is metabolized by both UGT1A1 and UGT1A9. We aim to characterize the UGT1A9-UGT1A1 haplotypes in Asians and Caucasians and gain insights on their functional consequences. METHODS: Asian and Caucasian individuals were genotyped for UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 variants. RESULTS: A higher frequency of the UGT1A9 -118T10 allele was observed in Asians compared to Caucasians, while the -275T>A and -2152C>T variants were relatively uncommon in Caucasians and not found in Asians. The strongest linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed between the UGT1A1 -53 and -3156 and between the UGT1A9 -275 and -2152 loci. Lower LD was observed between the -118 UGT1A9 variant and the UGT1A1 variants. Fourteen UGT1A9-UGT1A1 haplotypes were found in Asians, seven of them found to be shared by both populations. Common UGT1A9-UGT1A1 diplotypes were defined, and a difference was observed across the SN-38 glucuronidation rates in Caucasian livers stratified by diplotypes. CONCLUSION: This study for the first time described common UGT1A9-UGT1A1 haplotypes, highlighting important ethnic differences between Asians and Caucasians. If the functional effect of these haplotypes can be confirmed, this haplotypic information would be applicable to the correct design of prospective clinical studies of irinotecan, as well as of other drugs primarily metabolized by both UGT1A1 and UGT1A9.

15899389|t|Identification of a transcriptionally active hVH-5 pseudogene on 10q22.2.
15899389|a|Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important regulators of a vast number of biological functions that affect life and death of eukaryotic cells and are tightly regulated by the concerted action of several phosphatases. Among these is the human homologue of vaccinia virus H1 phosphatase gene clone 5 (hVH-5) product, which dephosphorylates and thus inhibits members of the MAPK family. Here, we analyzed hVH-5 transcripts in mammary carcinoma cell lines and discovered a sequence with 88% similarity to hVH-5 transcripts. Because this variant of hVH-5 lacked intronic sequences in its genomic structure, we suggest it might be a processed pseudogene of hVH-5. psihVH-5 transcripts were detected in human peripheral tissues as well as in 11 of 14 breast cancer cell lines. In respect to the normal hVH-5 gene, the pseudogene contains several point mutations and a frame shift due to the deletion of 2 bases that would lead to the truncation of the putative psihVH-5 product.

15970799|t|Functional characterization of SLCO1B1 (OATP-C) variants, SLCO1B1*5, SLCO1B1*15 and SLCO1B1*15+C1007G, by using transient expression systems of HeLa and HEK293 cells.
15970799|a|OBJECTIVES: SLCO1B1*5 and SLCO1B1*15 have been reported to reduce the clearance of pravastatin in healthy volunteers. However, there remains controversy in the effects of SLCO1B1*5 on the activity of OATP1B1 in vitro. In addition, the effect of SLCO1B1*15 on the function of OATP1B1 has not been studied using cDNA-expression systems. Object of the present study was to study the influence of SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G, a novel haplotype found in a patient with pravastatin-induced myopathy, on the functional properties of OATP1B1 by transient expression systems of HEK293 and HeLa cells using endogenous conjugates and statins as substrates. METHODS: Transporting assays for endogenous substrates were performed using tritium labeled estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide and estrone-3-sulfate. Quantitation of pravastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin and simvastatin were carried out using HPLC tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The transporting activities of cells expressing SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G decreased significantly but those of SLCO1B1*1b, *1a+C1007G and *1b+C1007G were not altered for all of the substrates tested except for simvastatin. Kinetic analysis of pravastatin and atorvastatin showed that Km values were not altered but Vmax values decreased significantly in cells expressing SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G. Immunocytochemical study showed that SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G proteins are localized not only at the plasma membrane but also in the intracellular space. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that 521T>C, existing commonly in SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G, is the key single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that determines the functional properties of SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G allelic proteins and that decreased activities of these variant proteins are mainly caused by a sorting error produced by this SNP.

16021854|t|The effect of exogenous estradiol treatment on the mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors in cultured human oviduct mucosal cells.
16021854|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate the responses of cultured oviduct mucosal cells to exogenous estradiol treatment in regulating the mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors. METHODS: The mucosal layer of the ampullary regions of the human oviduct was isolated and cultured with (study groups) or without (control group) the addition of exogenous estradiol in five different concentrations. Semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed on the oviduct mucosal cells before and after the 6-day culture. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the mRNA expression of VEGF and its receptors, both KDR and flt-1, between the five study groups and the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA expression of VEGF and its receptors is not altered by exogenous estradiol treatment in cultured oviduct. This helps to explain the mechanism of temporal regulation of VEGF in human oviduct, which reaches the peak level in the peri-ovulatory stage when both the serum estradiol and gonadotropins concentrations are high.

16047583|t|Luteal phase serum cell-free DNA as a marker of failed pregnancy after assisted reproductive technology.
16047583|a|PURPOSE: DNA-damaging factors have been reported in patients that failed to achieve pregnancy after assisted reproductive technologies (ART). The hypothesis was that increased circulating cell-free DNA released by damaged cells could predict unfavorable conditions leading to failed ART treatment. The objective was to compare the relative concentrations of cell-free DNA in the luteal phase sera of nonpregnant versus pregnant patients. METHODS: Frozen-thawed sera (30 IVF cases) were obtained 1 week after embryo transfer. There were 16 pregnant and 14 nonpregnant cases and controls consisting of male sera (n = 8 cases). Modified isocratic capillary electrophoresis was performed and the images analyzed for cell-free DNA. RESULTS: Circulating cell-free DNA were identified in the sera of all patients. The serum concentrations of high (12 kb) and low (1 kb) molecular weight cell-free DNA were similar for both nonpregnant and pregnant patients. Male control sera had higher cell-free DNA concentrations compared with females. Evaluation of sera from a control case showed no fluctuations in cell-free DNA concentrations throughout specific days of the menstrual cycle. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support the use of the luteal phase cell-free DNA concentration as a marker for failed pregnancies. The equal concentrations of high and low molecular weight cell-free DNA and ladder band-like gel patterns suggested cell apoptosis as the source of DNA.

16114047|t|Acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome: report of a child with phenotypic overlap with ulnar-mammary syndrome and a new mutation in TP63.
16114047|a|We report on a new patient with clinical findings consistent with acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome. The child had sparse hair, extensive freckling, lacrimal duct stenosis, oligodontia, dystrophic nails, reduced sweating, and bilateral athelia. Examination of his hands showed ulnar ray hypoplasia with bilateral fifth finger brachydactyly and camptodactyly. He also had surgical repair of an imperforate anus. Mutation analysis of TP63 showed a single nucleotide substitution, c.G518A, predicting a novel missense mutation, p.V114M in exon 4. This is the third mutation to be reported in TP63 in ADULT syndrome.

16158428|t|Delineation of the clinical phenotype associated with OPHN1 mutations based on the clinical and neuropsychological evaluation of three families.
16158428|a|Recent reports have demonstrated that mutations in the OPHN1 gene were responsible for a syndromic rather than non-specific mental retardation. Abnormalities of the posterior fossa with cerebellar hypoplasia have been demonstrated in all male patients reported to date. We report here a new family with X-linked mental retardation due to mutation in OPHN1 and present unpublished data about two families previously reported, concerning the facial and psychological phenotype of affected males and carrier females. Our study confirms that cerebellar hypoplasia is a hallmark of this syndrome. In addition, affected males display facial similarities that can help the diagnosis. Most carrier females have mild mental retardation and subtle facial changes.

16179221|t|Application of a comprehensive subtelomere array in clinical diagnosis of mental retardation.
16179221|a|In 2-8% of patients with mental retardation, small copy number changes in the subtelomeric region are thought to be the underlying cause. As detection of these genomic rearrangements is labour intensive using FISH, we constructed and validated a high-density BAC/PAC array covering the first 5 Mb of all subtelomeric regions and applied it in our routine screening of patients with idiopathic mental retardation for submicroscopic telomeric rearrangements. The present study shows the efficiency of this comprehensive subtelomere array in detecting terminal deletions and duplications but also small interstitial subtelomeric rearrangements, starting from small amounts of DNA. With our array, the size of the affected segments, at least those smaller than 5 Mb, can be determined simultaneously in the same experiment. In the first 100 patient samples analysed in our diagnostic practice by the use of this comprehensive telomere array, we found three patients with deletions in 3p, 10q and 15q, respectively, four patients with duplications in 9p, 12p, 21q and Xp, respectively, and one patient with a del 6q/dup 16q. The patients with del 3p and 10q and dup 12p had interstitial rearrangements that would have been missed with techniques using one probe per subtelomeric region chosen close to the telomere.

16247291|t|NSD1 analysis for Sotos syndrome: insights and perspectives from the clinical laboratory.
16247291|a|PURPOSE: Sotos syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized primarily by overgrowth, developmental delay, and a characteristic facial gestalt. Defects in the NSD1 gene are present in approximately 80% of patients with Sotos syndrome. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of NSD1 abnormalities in patients referred to a clinical laboratory for testing and to identify clinical criteria that distinguish between patients with and without NSD1 abnormalities. METHODS: Deletion or mutation analysis of the NSD1 gene was performed on 435 patients referred to our clinical genetics laboratory. Detailed clinical information was obtained on 86 patients with and without NSD1 abnormalities, and a clinical checklist was developed to help distinguish between these two groups of patients. RESULTS: Abnormalities of the NSD1 gene were identified in 55 patients, including 9 deletions and 46 mutations. Thus, in the clinical laboratory setting, deletions were found in 2% and mutations in 21% of samples analyzed, because not all patients had both tests. Thirty-three previously unreported mutations in the NSD1 gene were identified. Clinical features typically associated with Sotos syndrome were not found to be significantly different between individuals with and without NSD1 abnormalities. The clinical checklist developed included poor feeding, increased body mass index, and enlarged cerebral ventricles, in addition to the typical clinical features of Sotos syndrome, and was able to distinguish between the two groups with 80% sensitivity and 70% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The dramatic decrease in the frequency of finding NSD1 abnormalities in the clinical laboratory is likely because of the heterogeneity of the patient population. Our experience from a diagnostic laboratory can help guide clinicians in deciding for whom NSD1 genetic analysis is indicated.

16271961|t|Rarity of IgH translocations in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.
16271961|a|Comparatively little is known of the cytogenetics of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). This is primarily due to the low proliferation of the clonal B cells, which precludes conventional karyotyping in many cases. Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene at 14q32 are characteristic of many B-cell lymphomas and myelomas. Initial reports suggested that the t(9;14) was characteristic of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (the underlying pathological diagnosis in WM), but subsequent studies have failed to confirm the uniqueness of the translocation. To clarify this, we examined 69 cases of WM with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and failed to demonstrate an IgH translocation in 67 (97%). We conclude that IGH translocations are not a feature of WM, and the implications of this finding are discussed.

16273295|t|IL-1 receptor antagonist attenuates MAP kinase/AP-1 activation and MMP1 expression in UVA-irradiated human fibroblasts induced by culture medium from UVB-irradiated human skin keratinocytes.
16273295|a|Solar UV light comprises UVB wavelengths (290-320 nm) and UVA wavelengths (320-400 nm). UVB radiation reaches the epidermis and, to a lesser extent, the upper part of the dermis, while UVA radiation penetrates more deeply into human skin. Existing studies have demonstrated that UV-irradiated epidermal keratinocytes release cytokines that indirectly promote MMP-1 production in dermal fibroblasts. In this study, we first investigated the effect of IL-1 on MAPK activity, c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA expression, and MMP-1 and MMP-2 production in UVA-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts. The results showed that UVA irradiation dose-dependently increased MMP-1 but not MMP-2 production in human skin fibroblasts. IL-1alpha and IL-1beta promoted MMP-1 but not MMP-2 production in UVA-irradiated fibroblasts. Both IL-1alpha and IL-1beta activated MAP kinase, significantly elevating c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA expression. We then investigated the indirect effect of UVB-irradiated keratinocyte culture medium on MMP-1 production in UVA-irradiated primary cultured human dermal fibroblasts and the effect of IL-1Ra. The results showed that cell culture medium from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes increased MMP-1 production in UVA-irradiated fibroblasts, and IL-1Ra dose-dependently inhibited MMP-1 production. IL-1Ra dose-dependently inhibited c-Jun mRNA expression of fibroblasts with no significant effect on c-Fos mRNA expression. These results demonstrate that UVB-irradiated keratinocytes promoted MMP-1 production in UVA-irradiated fibroblasts in a paracrine manner while IL-1Ra reduced MMP-1 production through inhibiting c-Jun mRNA expression. Collectively, our data suggest that IL-1 plays an important role in the dermal collagen degradation associated with UV-induced premature aging of the skin and IL-1Ra may be applied for the prevention and treatment of photoaging.

16319131|t|Temporal and parental-specific expression of imprinted genes in a newly derived Chinese human embryonic stem cell line and embryoid bodies.
16319131|a|Although the study of imprinted genes in human development is very important, little is known about their expression and regulation in the early differentiation of human tissues due to lack of an appropriate model. In this study, a Chinese human embryonic stem (hES) cell line, SHhES1, was derived and fully characterized. Expression profiles of human imprinted genes were determined by Affymetrix Oligo micro-array in undifferentiated SHhES1 cells and SHhES1-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) at day 3, 8, 13 and 18. Thirty-two known human imprinted genes were detected in undifferentiated ES cells. Significantly, differential expression was found in nine genes at different stages of EB formation. Expression profile changes were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in SHhES1 cells as well as in another independently derived hES cell line, HUES-7. In addition, the monoallelic expressions of four imprinted genes were examined in three different passages of undifferentiated ES cells and EBs of both hES cell lines. The monoallelic expressions of imprinted genes, H19, PEG10, NDNL1 and KCNQ1 were maintained in both undifferentiated hES cells and derived EBs. More importantly, with the availability of maternal peripheral blood lymphocyte sample, we demonstrated that the maternal expression of KCNQ1 and the paternal expression of NDNL1 and PEG10 were maintained in SHhES1 cells. These data provide the first demonstration that the parental-specific expression of imprinted genes is stable in EBs after extensive differentiation, also indicating that in vitro fertilization protocol does not disrupt the parental monoallelic expression of the imprinted genes examined.

16339195|t|A comparison of folic acid deficiency-induced genomic instability in lymphocytes of breast cancer patients and normal non-cancer controls from a Chinese population in Yunnan.
16339195|a|We hypothesized that the genomic response to folate deficiency might be different between breast cancer cases and healthy subjects. To test this hypothesis, we performed a comprehensive study on the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of in vitro folic acid (FA) deficiency on primary human lymphocytes from 19 breast cancer patients and 20 age-matched healthy females from Yunnan, China using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. Lymphocytes from the volunteers were cultured in RPMI1640 medium containing 30, 120 or 240 nM FA for 9 days. The results showed that 30 nM FA was associated with increased frequencies of micronucleated binucleated cell (MNed BNC), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB), nuclear buds (BUD), apoptosis (APO) and necrosis (NEC) relative to 120 and 240 nM FA (P<0.001) in lymphocytes of case and control groups in vitro, however there were no significant differences between the 120 and 240 nM FA within each sampling group. The case group showed significantly higher frequencies of MNed BNC than control at 120 and 240 nM FA (P<0.05-0.001) but not at 30 nM FA (P=0.052). NEC was significantly higher in breast cancer group than control at all concentrations of FA (P<0.005). FA concentration explained 60, 39, 39, 52 and 71% of the variance of MNed BNC, NPB, BUD, APO and NEC, respectively compared with breast cancer status which only explained 6 and 7% of the variance of MNed BNC and NEC(Two way ANOVA, P<0.0001). Difference of difference analysis showed that breast cancer cases were not abnormally sensitive to the genome-damaging effect of folate deficiency. We concluded that (i) increased concentrations of FA abolished the genome-damaging effect of FA deficiency in lymphocytes of both breast cancer patients and controls to a similar extent and (ii) FA concentration is much more important than breast cancer status in determining genomic instability and cell death.

16391555|t|Evaluating the role of the 620W allele of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22 in Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis.
16391555|a|The 620W allele of PTPN22 has been associated with susceptibility to several different forms of chronic inflammatory disease, including Type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). We set out to explore its possible role in two other inflammatory diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS) and Crohn's disease (CD). In our cohort of 496 MS trios from the United Kingdom, we observed reduced transmission of the PTPN22 620W allele. The CD sample consisted of 169 trios as well as 249 cases of CD with their 207 matched control subjects collected in the province of Quebec, Canada; there was also no evidence of association between the PTPN22 620W allele and susceptibility for CD. Pooled analyses combining our data with published data assessed a total of 1496 cases of MS and 1019 cases of CD but demonstrated no evidence of association with either disease. Given the modest odds ratios of known risk alleles for inflammatory diseases, these analyses do not exclude a role for the PTPN22 allele in susceptibility to CD or MS, but they do suggest that such a putative role would probably be more modest than that reported so far in T1D, RA, SLE, and AIT.

16412238|t|Peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor-gamma deficiency in a Canadian kindred with familial partial lipodystrophy type 3 (FPLD3).
16412238|a|BACKGROUND: Familial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan) type 3 (FPLD3, Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] 604367) results from heterozygous mutations in PPARG encoding peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. Both dominant-negative and haploinsufficiency mechanisms have been suggested for this condition. METHODS: We present a Canadian FPLD3 kindred with an affected mother who had loss of fat on arms and legs, but no increase in facial, neck, suprascapular or abdominal fat. She had profound insulin resistance, diabetes, severe hypertriglyceridemia and relapsing pancreatitis, while her pre-pubescent daughter had normal fat distribution but elevated plasma triglycerides and C-peptide and depressed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. RESULTS: The mother and daughter were each heterozygous for PPARG nonsense mutation Y355X, whose protein product in vitro was transcriptionally inactive with no dominant-negative activity against the wild-type receptor. In addition the mutant protein appeared to be markedly unstable. CONCLUSION: Taken together with previous studies of human PPARG mutations, these findings suggest that PPAR-gamma deficiency due either to haploinsufficiency or to substantial activity loss due to dominant negative interference of the normal allele product's function can each contribute to the FPLD3 phenotype.

16463024|t|The TNFalpha receptor TNFRSF1A and genes encoding the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel ENaC as modulators in cystic fibrosis.
16463024|a|The CFTR mutations in cystic fibrosis (CF) lead to ion transport anomalities which predispose to chronic infection and inflammation of CF airways as the major determinants for morbidity and mortality in CF. Discordant clinical phenotypes of siblings with identical CFTR mutations and the large variability of clinical manifestations of patients who are homozygous for the most common mutation F508del suggest that both environment and genes other than CFTR contribute substantially to CF disease. The prime candidates for genetic modifiers in CF are elements of host defence such as the TNFalpha receptor and of ion transport such as the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel ENaC, both of which are encoded side by side on 12p13 (TNFRSF1A, SCNN1A) and 16p12 (SCNN1B, SCNN1G). Thirty-seven families with F508del-CFTR homozygous siblings exhibiting extreme clinical phenotypes that had been selected from the 467 pairs of the European CF Twin and Sibling Study were genotyped at 12p13 and 16p12 markers. The ENaC was identified as a modulator of CF by transmission disequilibrium at SCNN1G and association with CF phenotype intrapair discordance at SCNN1B. Family-based and case-control analyses and sequencing of SCNN1A and TNFRSF1A uncovered an association of the TNFRSF1A intron 1 haplotype with disease severity. Carriers of risk haplotypes were underrepresented suggesting a strong impact of both loci on survival. The finding that TNFRSF1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G are clinically relevant modulators of CF disease supports current concepts that the depletion of airway surface liquid and inadequate host inflammatory responses trigger pulmonary disease in CF.

16510324|t|Chiari type I malformation in four unrelated patients affected with Fabry disease.
16510324|a|Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked inborn error of metabolism resulting from the deficient activity of alpha-galactosidase A which leads to the widespread deposition of glycosphingolipids in lysosomes, and to ischemic complications involving kidneys, heart and brain. Among neurological symptoms, strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIA) have been reported. A 30-year-old male patient, with FD, was referred to us for evaluation of a sudden episode of dizziness, with disequilibrium, and diplopia, in agreement with the diagnosis of a TIA. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no cerebrovascular involvement but revealed the presence of Chiari type I malformation (CMI). We subsequently performed head MRI in a cohort of 44 consecutive hemizygous male patients and seven heterozygous females affected with FD, and identified three additional cases (two males and one female) of CMI. Whether the association is coincidental or not will need further studies but our data suggest that CMI should be ruled out in all Fabry patients.

16525709|t|Fibrin sealant promotes migration and proliferation of human articular chondrocytes: possible involvement of thrombin and protease-activated receptors.
16525709|a|Fibrin sealant (FS), a biological adhesive material, has been recently recommended as an adjunct in autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). While FS has been shown to possess osteoinductive potential, little is known about its effects on chondrogenic cells. In this study, we assessed the bioactivity of FS (Tisseel) on the migration and proliferation of human articular chondrocytes in vitro. Using a co-culture assay to mimic matrix-induced ACI (MACI), chondrocytes were found to migrate from collagen membranes towards FS within 12 h of culture, with significant migratory activity evident by 24 h. In addition, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation experiments revealed that thrombin, the active component of the tissue glue, stimulated chondrocyte proliferation, with maximal efficacy observed at 48 h post-stimulation (1-10 U/ml). In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these thrombin-induced effects, we examined the expression and activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs), established thrombin receptors. Using a combination of RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, all four PARs were detected in human chondrocytes, with PAR-1 being the major isoform expressed. Moreover, thrombin and a PAR-1, but not other PAR-isotype-specific peptide agonists, were found to induce rapid intracellular Ca2+ responses in human chondrocytes in calcium mobilization assays. Together, these data demonstrate that FS supports both the migration and proliferation of human chondrocytes. We propose that these effects are mediated, at least in part, via thrombin-induced PAR-1 signalling in human chondrocytes.

16525711|t|WISP-2 expression in human salivary gland tumors.
16525711|a|This study was designed to disclose detailed genetic mechanisms in salivary gland tumors (SGTs) for development of novel independent marker. We constructed an in-house cDNA microarray carrying 2,201 cDNA clones derived from SGT and oral squamous cell carcinoma cDNA libraries. Four cell lines that originated from the SGT-derived cell lines were analyzed using this microarray system. The genes identified by our microarray system were further analyzed at the mRNA or protein expression level in other types of human cancer cell lines and clinical samples (ten normal salivary glands [NSGs], eleven pleomorphic adenomas, ten adenoid cystic carcinomas and three adenocarcinomas). Two up-regulated genes and six down-regulated genes were identified in common when compared with the control RNA. Of the up-regulated genes, WISP-2, which plays an important role in breast carcinogenesis, was selected for further analyses. We found a higher expression of the WISP-2 gene in the SGT-derived cell lines compared with other types of human cancer cell lines. Furthermore, WISP-2 mRNA and protein expression levels in NSGs were significantly higher than those in SGTs. These results suggest that WISP-2 could be a reliable independent marker and that down-regulation or loss of the WISP-2 gene may be associated with the development of SGTs.

16526029|t|Evaluation of RGS4 as a candidate gene for schizophrenia.
16526029|a|Several studies have suggested that the regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) may be a positional and functional candidate gene for schizophrenia. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located at the promoter region (SNP4 and SNP7) and the intron 1 (SNP18) of RGS4 have been verified in different ethnic groups. Positive results have been reported in these SNPs with different numbers of SNP combinatory haplotypes. In this study, these three SNP markers were genotyped in 218 schizophrenia pedigrees of Taiwan (864 individuals) for association analysis. Among these three SNPs, neither SNP4, SNP7, SNP18 has shown significant association with schizophrenia in single locus association analysis, nor any compositions of the three SNP haplotypes has shown significantly associations with the DSM-IV diagnosed schizophrenia. Our results fail to support the RGS4 as a candidate gene for schizophrenia when evaluated from these three SNP markers.

16541406|t|Distinct patterns of germ-line deletions in MLH1 and MSH2: the implication of Alu repetitive element in the genetic etiology of Lynch syndrome (HNPCC).
16541406|a|A relatively high frequency of germ-line genomic rearrangements in MLH1 and MSH2 has been reported among Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC) patients from different ethnic populations. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we characterized the DNA breakpoints of 11 germ-line deletions, six for MLH1 and five for MSH2. Distinct deletion patterns were found for the two genes. The five cases of MSH2 deletions result exclusively from intragenic unequal recombination mediated by repetitive Alu sequences. In contrast, five out of the six MLH1 deletions are due to recombinations involving sequences of no significant homology (P=0.015). A detailed analysis of the DNA breakpoints in the two genes, previously characterized by other groups, validated the observation that Alu-mediated unequal recombination is the main type of deletion in MSH2 (n=34), but not in MLH1 (n=21) (P<0.0001). Plotting the distribution of known DNA breakpoints among the introns of the two genes showed that, the highest breakpoint density is co-localized with the highest Alu density. Our study suggests that Alu is a promoting factor for the genomic recombinations in both MLH1 and MSH2, and the local Alu density may be involved in shaping the deletion pattern.

16611040|t|Gene therapy for cystic fibrosis airway disease- is clinical success imminent?
16611040|a|Cystic fibrosis (CF) was one of the first inherited disorders for which gene therapy was seriously considered as a realistic option for treatment, and as such, it has long provided a paradigm for gene therapy of inherited diseases. However, despite the cloning of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene in 1989, over 15 years later a practical gene therapy for CF has not eventuated. There are a number of reasons for this, and analysis of the specific issues that have delayed the successful development of gene therapy for CF also provides general insights into the practical complexities involved in the development of gene therapy for inherited disorders. The issues which have prevented the application of gene therapy for CF to date include the lack of suitable gene delivery technologies, the complexities of the interactions between the host and vector, the biology of the lung airways, and the nature of the pathology found in individuals with CF. We will discuss the history of CF gene therapy with specific reference to these and other issues that pre-occupy the field at present: namely, the question of what vectors appear to be suitable for airway gene delivery in CF, what cells must be targeted, how airway epithelium defences can be overcome or eluded to allow efficient gene delivery, how to ensure safe and long-term transgene expression and the need to identify relevant surrogate success measures that can be used to assess the outcome of gene therapy in CF patients.

16648377|t|Mutations responsible for Larsen syndrome cluster in the FLNB protein.
16648377|a|BACKGROUND: A gene for Larsen syndrome was recently described, and mutations were reported in five cases. OBJECTIVE: To test whether mutations in this gene, FLNB, could explain the disease in our independent collection of sporadic and dominant Larsen syndrome cases; and to test whether mutations occurred in a non-random pattern. RESULTS: Missense mutations were found in each of five cases. Four of the five were new; one was reported in a sporadic case in the original Larsen syndrome study of five cases. All mutations from the two studies were compiled. Clustered mutations were observed within three filamin B protein domains: the calponin homology 2 domain, repeat 14, and repeat 15. This suggested that as few as five (of the total of 46) coding exons of FLNB could be screened to detect Larsen syndrome mutations. Four of these exons were screened in a sixth (sporadic) case and a previously reported G1691S substitution mutation detected. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in FLNB may be responsible for all cases of Larsen syndrome. They appear to occur in specific functional domains of the filamin B protein. This should simplify diagnostic screening of the FLNB gene. Analyses in larger patient series are warranted to quantify this. The study confirmed the extreme variability in clinical presentation and the presence of unaffected carriers. A molecular screen would be valuable for diagnosis and genetic counselling.

16688748|t|Array-based comparative genomic hybridization facilitates identification of breakpoints of a novel der(1)t(1;18)(p36.3;q23)dn in a child presenting with mental retardation.
16688748|a|Monosomy of distal 1p36 represents the most common terminal deletion in humans and results in one of the most frequently diagnosed mental retardation syndromes. This deletion is considered a contiguous gene deletion syndrome, and has been shown to vary in deletion sizes that contribute to the spectrum of phenotypic anomalies seen in patients with monosomy 1p36. We report on an 8-year-old female with characteristics of the monosomy 1p36 syndrome who demonstrated a novel der(1)t(1;18)(p36.3;q23). Initial G-banded karyotype analysis revealed a deleted chromosome 1, with a breakpoint within 1p36.3. Subsequent FISH and array-based comparative genomic hybridization not only confirmed and partially characterized the deletion of chromosome 1p36.3, but also uncovered distal trisomy for 18q23. In this patient, the duplicated 18q23 is translocated onto the deleted 1p36.3 region, suggesting telomere capture. Molecular characterization of this novel der(1)t(1;18)(p36.3;q23), guided by our clinical array-comparative genomic hybridization, demonstrated a 3.2 Mb terminal deletion of chromosome 1p36.3 and a 200 kb duplication of 18q23 onto the deleted 1p36.3, presumably stabilizing the deleted chromosome 1. DNA sequence analysis around the breakpoints demonstrated no homology, and therefore this telomere capture of distal 18q is apparently the result of a non-homologous recombination. Partial trisomy for 18q23 has not been previously reported. The importance of mapping the breakpoints of all balanced and unbalanced translocations found in the clinical laboratory, when phenotypic abnormalities are found, is discussed.

16691587|t|Clinical and molecular characterization of individuals with 18p deletion: a genotype-phenotype correlation.
16691587|a|The deletion 18p syndrome is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities. The medical problems are mental and postnatal growth retardation, and sometimes malformations of the heart and brain. The individuals have some typical features, which might be easy to overlook and which are: ptosis, strabismus, hypertelorism, broad flat nose, micrognathia, big and low set ears. The aims of present study were to clinically and molecularly characterize the syndrome further in seven subjects with de novo 18p deletions and to perform genotype-phenotype correlation. All seven subjects had terminal deletions and no interstitial deletion was observed with subtelomeric FISH analyses. To define the extent of the 18p deletions and the parental origin of the deletion microsatellite- and FISH analyses were performed on genomic DNA and on lymphoblastoid cell lines of the study participants. Totally 19 chromosomes, 18 specific polymorphic microsatellite markers, and 5 BAC clones were used. The results revealed that the deletions were located in the centromeric region at 18p11.1 in four of the seven subjects. In the remaining three the breakpoints were located distal to 18p11.1 (18p11.21-p11.22). Four of the individuals had a paternal and three a maternal origin of the deletion. Genotype-phenotype correlation of the seven subjects suggests a correlation between the extent of the deleted region and the mental development. All the four children with a deletion in the centromeric region at 18p11.1 had a mental retardation (MR). Two of the three children with a more distal breakpoint (distal 18p11.21) had a normal mental development and one had a border-line mental retardation. There might be a critical region for the mental retardation located between 18p11.1 and 18p11.21. The children with a breakpoint at 18p11.1 had all a broad face, which was observed in only one of those with a more distal breakpoint, otherwise no genotype-phenotype correlation of the features was observed.

16691619|t|Split-hand/split-foot malformation 3 (SHFM3) at 10q24, development of rapid diagnostic methods and gene expression from the region.
16691619|a|Split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM, also called ectrodactyly) is a clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous group of limb malformations. Several SHFM loci have been mapped, including SHFM1 (7q21), SHFM2 (Xq26), SHFM3 (10q24), SHFM4 (3q27) and SHFM5 (2q31). To date, mutations in a gene (TP63) have only been identified for SHFM4. SHFM3 has been shown by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to be caused by an approximately 500 kb DNA rearrangement at 10q24. This region contains a number of candidate genes for SHFM3, though which gene(s) is (are) involved in the pathogenesis of SHFM3 is not known. Our aim in this study was to improve the diagnosis of SHFM3, and to begin to understand which genes are involved in SHFM3. Here we show, using two different techniques, FISH and quantitative PCR that SHFM3 is caused by a minimal 325 kb duplication containing only two genes (BTRC and POLL). The data presented provide improved methods for diagnosis and begin to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of SHFM3. Expression analysis of 13 candidate genes within and flanking the duplicated region shows that BTRC (present in three copies) and SUFU (present in two copies) are overexpressed in SHFM3 patients compared to controls. Our data suggest that SHFM3 may be caused by overexpression of BTRC and SUFU, both of which are involved in beta-catenin signalling.

16737910|t|Identification of the nuclear localization motif in the ETV6 (TEL) protein.
16737910|a|ETV6, or Translocation-Ets-Leukemia (TEL), is an ETS family transcriptional repressor that is essential for establishing hematopoiesis in neonatal bone marrow, and is frequently a target of chromosomal translocations in human cancer. ETV6 is predominantly a nuclear phosphoprotein that represses transcription by binding directly to the promoters of target genes. The nuclear localization mechanism of ETV6, however, is not well understood. In this report, we provide evidence that a nuclear localization signal (NLS) exists in the C-terminal region of ETV6. ETV6 proteins with mutations outside of amino acids 332-452 localize to the nucleus, whereas proteins with mutations within amino acids 332-452 remain in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, when a fragment of ETV6 comprised of amino acids 332-452 was fused to cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase protein, the fusion protein was able to enter the nucleus. These results strongly indicate that residues 332-452 mediate nuclear localization of ETV6.

16786513|t|McArdle disease: the mutation spectrum of PYGM in a large Italian cohort.
16786513|a|Deficiency of the muscle isozyme of glycogen phosphorylase is causative of McArdle disease or Glycogen storage disease type V (GSD-V), the most common autosomal recessive disorder of glycogen metabolism. The typical clinical presentation is characterized by exercise intolerance with cramps, and recurrent myoglobinuria. To date, 46 mutations in the PYGM gene have been detected in GSD-V patients. We report the mutational spectrum in 68 Italian patients. We identified 30 different mutations in the PYGM gene, including 19 mutations that have not been reported previously. The novel mutations include: eight missense mutations (c.475G>A, p.G159R; c.689C>G, p.P230R; c.1094C>T, p.A365E; c.1151C>A, p.A384D; c.1182C>T, p.R428C; c.1471C>T, p.R491C; c.2444A>C, p.D815A; c.2477G>C, p.W826S), two nonsense mutations (c.1475G>A, p.W492X; c.1627A>T, p.K543X), five splice site mutations (c.855 +1G>C; c.1092 +1G>A; c. 1093-1G>T; c.1239 +1G>A; c.2380 +1G>A), and four deletions (c.715_717delGTC, p.V239del; c.304delA, p.N102DfsX4; c.1970_2177del, p.V657_G726; c.2113_2114delGG, p.G705RfsX16). Whereas we confirmed lack of direct correlation between the clinical phenotype and the genotype, we also found that the so-called 'common mutation' (p.R50X) accounted for about 43% of alleles in our cohort and that no population-related mutations are clearly identified in Italian patients.

17006606|t|A polymorphism of C-to-T substitution at -31 IL1B is associated with the risk of advanced gastric adenocarcinoma in a Japanese population.
17006606|a|Proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms have been demonstrated to associate with gastric cancer risk, of which IL1B-31T/C and -511C/T changes have been well investigated due to the possibility that they may alter the IL1B transcription. The signal transduction target upon interleukin 1 beta (IL1beta) stimulation, the nuclear factor of kappa B (NFkappaB) activation, supports cancer development, signal transduction in which is mediated by FS-7 cell-associated cell surface antigen (FAS) signaling. Based on recent papers describing the prognostic roles of the polymorphisms and the NFkappaB functions on cancer development, we sought to determine if Japanese gastric cancer patients were affected by the IL1B -31/-511 and FAS-670 polymorphisms. A case-control study was conducted on incident gastric adenocarcinoma patients (n=271) and age-gender frequency-matched control subjects (n=271). We observed strong linkage disequilibrium between the T allele at -511 and the C allele at -31 and between the C allele at -511 and the T allele at -31 in IL1B in both the cases and controls (R (2)=0.94). Neither IL1B-31, -511 nor FAS-670 polymorphisms showed significantly different risks of gastric adenocarcinoma. Though FAS-670 polymorphisms did not show any significant difference, the proportion of subjects with IL1B-31TT (or IL1B-511CC) increased according to stage (trend P=0.019). In particular, subjects with stage IV had a two times higher probability of having either IL1B-31TT (or IL1B-511CC) genotype compared with stage I subjects. These observations suggest that IL1B-31TT and IL1B-511CC are associated with disease progression.

17033686|t|A two base pair deletion in the PQBP1 gene is associated with microphthalmia, microcephaly, and mental retardation.
17033686|a|X-linked mental retardation has been traditionally divided into syndromic (S-XLMR) and non-syndromic forms (NS-XLMR), although the borderlines between these phenotypes begin to vanish and mutations in a single gene, for example PQBP1, can cause S-XLMR as well as NS-XLMR. Here, we report two maternal cousins with an apparently X-linked phenotype of mental retardation (MR), microphthalmia, choroid coloboma, microcephaly, renal hypoplasia, and spastic paraplegia. By multipoint linkage analysis with markers spanning the entire X-chromosome we mapped the disease locus to a 28-Mb interval between Xp11.4 and Xq12, including the BCOR gene. A missense mutation in BCOR was described in a family with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome, a phenotype showing substantial overlapping features with that described in the two cousins. However, no mutation in the BCOR gene was found in both patients. Subsequent mutation analysis of PQBP1, located within the delineated linkage interval in Xp11.23, revealed a 2-bp deletion, c.461_462delAG, that cosegregated with the disease. Notably, the same mutation is associated with the Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome, another form of S-XLMR. Haplotype analysis suggests a germline mosaicism of the 2-bp deletion in the maternal grandmother of both affected individuals. In summary, our findings demonstrate for the first time that mutations in PQBP1 are associated with an S-XLMR phenotype including microphthalmia, thereby further extending the clinical spectrum of phenotypes associated with PQBP1 mutations.

17036344|t|A case surviving for over a year of renal tubular dysgenesis with compound heterozygous angiotensinogen gene mutations.
17036344|a|Renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD) is a developmental abnormality of the renal proximal tubules found in patients with Potter syndrome. We report a female newborn with RTD who has survived for more than 18 months. Infusions of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the early neonatal period were effective in raising and maintaining her blood pressure. Peritoneal dialysis was required until the appearance of spontaneous urination at 29 days after birth. Histopathological examinations of the kidney revealed dilated renal tubular lumina and foamy columnar epithelial cells in the renal tubules. Endocrinological studies showed a discrepancy between low plasma renin activity (<0.1 ng/ml/hr) and high active renin concentration (135,000 pg/ml), suggesting an aberration in the renin substrate, angiotensinogen. Direct sequencing analysis revealed two novel mutations in the coding region of the angiotensinogen gene (AGT): a nonsense mutation in exon 2 (c.604C > T) and a frameshift deletion at nucleotide 1290 in exon 5 (c.1290delT). The mutations were in the compound heterozygous state, because each parent had each mutation. These findings suggest that angiotensinogen deficiency is one of the causes of RTD. A treatment of the condition with FFP may help to promote long survival.

17160890|t|Functional variants in the promoter region of Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) and susceptibility to schizophrenia.
17160890|a|The chitinase 3-like 1 gene (CHI3L1) is abnormally expressed in the hippocampus of subjects with schizophrenia and may be involved in the cellular response to various environmental events that are reported to increase the risk of schizophrenia. Here, we provide evidence that the functional variants at the CHI3L1 locus influence the genetic risk of schizophrenia. First, using case-control and transmission/disequilibrium-test (TDT) methodologies, we detected a significant association between schizophrenia and haplotypes within the promoter region of CHI3L1 in two independent cohorts of Chinese individuals. Second, the at-risk CCC haplotype (P=.00058 and .0018 in case-control and TDT studies, respectively) revealed lower transcriptional activity (P=2.2 x 10(-7)) and was associated with lower expression (P=3.1 x 10(-5)) compared with neutral and protective haplotypes. Third, we found that an allele of SNP4 (rs4950928), the tagging SNP of CCC, impaired the MYC/MAX-regulated transcriptional activation of CHI3L1 by altering the transcriptional-factor consensus sequences, and this may be responsible for the decreased expression of the CCC haplotype. In contrast, the protective TTG haplotype was associated with a high level of CHI3L1 expression. Our findings identify CHI3L1 as a potential schizophrenia-susceptibility gene and suggest that the genes involved in the biological response to adverse environmental conditions are likely to play roles in the predisposition to schizophrenia.

17160896|t|Orofacial cleft risk is increased with maternal smoking and specific detoxification-gene variants.
17160896|a|Maternal smoking is a recognized risk factor for orofacial clefts. Maternal or fetal pharmacogenetic variants are plausible modulators of this risk. In this work, we studied 5,427 DNA samples, including 1,244 from subjects in Denmark and Iowa with facial clefting and 4,183 from parents, siblings, or unrelated population controls. We examined 25 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 16 genes in pathways for detoxification of components of cigarette smoke, to look for evidence of gene-environment interactions. For genes identified as related to oral clefting, we studied gene-expression profiles in fetal development in the relevant tissues and time intervals. Maternal smoking was a significant risk factor for clefting and showed dosage effects, in both the Danish and Iowan data. Suggestive effects of variants in the fetal NAT2 and CYP1A1 genes were observed in both the Iowan and the Danish participants. In an expanded case set, NAT2 continued to show significant overtransmission of an allele to the fetus, with a final P value of .00003. There was an interaction between maternal smoking and fetal inheritance of a GSTT1-null deletion, seen in both the Danish (P=.03) and Iowan (P=.002) studies, with a Fisher's combined P value of <.001, which remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Gene-expression analysis demonstrated expression of GSTT1 in human embryonic craniofacial tissues during the relevant developmental interval. This study benefited from two large samples, involving independent populations, that provided substantial power and a framework for future studies that could identify a susceptible population for preventive health care.

17185386|t|Families with the risk allele of DISC1 reveal a link between schizophrenia and another component of the same molecular pathway, NDE1.
17185386|a|We have previously reported a robust association between an allelic haplotype of 'Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1' (DISC1) and schizophrenia in a nationwide collection of Finnish schizophrenia families. This specific DISC1 allele was later identified to associate with visual working memory, selectively in males. DISC1 association to schizophrenia has since been replicated in multiple independent study samples from different populations. In this study, we conditioned our sample of Finnish families for the presence of the Finnish tentative risk allele for DISC1 and re-analyzed our genome-wide scan data of 443 markers on the basis of this stratification. Two additional loci displayed an evidence of linkage (LOD > 3) and included a locus on 16p13, proximal to the gene encoding NDE1, which has been shown to biologically interact with DISC1. Although none of the observed linkages remained significant after multiple test correction through simulation, further analysis of NDE1 revealed an association between a tag-haplotype and schizophrenia (P = 0.00046) specific to females, which proved to be significant (P = 0.011) after multiple test correction. Our finding would support the concept that initial gene findings in multifactorial diseases will assist in the identification of other components of complex genetic etiology. Notably, this and other converging lines of evidence underline the importance of DISC1-related functional pathways in the etiology of schizophrenia.

17221874|t|Townes-Brocks syndrome: twenty novel SALL1 mutations in sporadic and familial cases and refinement of the SALL1 hot spot region.
17221874|a|Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) is an autosomal dominant malformation syndrome characterized by renal, anal, ear, and thumb anomalies caused by SALL1 mutations. To date, 36 SALL1 mutations have been described in TBS patients. All but three of those, namely p.R276X, p.S372X, and c.1404dupG, have been found only in single families thereby preventing phenotype-genotype correlations. Here we present 20 novel mutations (12 short deletions, five short duplications, three nonsense mutations) in 20 unrelated families. We delineate the phenotypes and report previously unknown ocular manifestations, i.e. congenital cataracts with unilateral microphthalmia. We show that 46 out of the now 56 SALL1 mutations are located between the coding regions for the glutamine-rich domain mediating SALL protein interactions and 65 bp 3' of the coding region for the first double zinc finger domain, narrowing the SALL1 mutational hotspot region to a stretch of 802 bp within exon 2. Of note, only two SALL1 mutations would result in truncated proteins without the glutamine-rich domain, one of which is reported here. The latter is associated with anal, ear, hand, and renal manifestations, indicating that the glutamine-rich domain is not required for typical TBS.

17223398|t|A 6Mb deletion in band 2q22 due to a complex chromosome rearrangement associated with severe psychomotor retardation, microcephaly and distinctive dysmorphic facial features.
17223398|a|High-resolution analyses of complex chromosome rearrangements (CCR) have demonstrated in individuals with abnormal phenotypes that not all seemingly balanced CCRs based on G-banding are completely balanced at breakpoint level. Here we report on an apparently balanced de novo CCR involving chromosomes 2, 3 and 5 present in a 6-month-old girl. She was referred for genetic evaluation because of severe psychomotor retardation, distinctive dysmorphic features and microcephaly. A 1Mb resolution array-CGH analysis of DNA from the patient revealed a deletion of about 6Mb for chromosome 2. FISH analysis showed that the deletion interval found in band 2q22 mapped at the translocation breakpoint, and that the ZFHX1B gene, which is known to be involved in the Mowat-Wilson syndrome, is located within the deletion interval. To our knowledge this is the first case of a complex chromosomal rearrangement associated with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. Our data illustrate the important role for high-resolution investigation of apparently balanced chromosome rearrangements in patients with unexplained psychomotor retardation and/or other clinical features, and should contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in chromosome rearrangement.

17267816|t|Overexpression of DNA polymerase beta results in an increased rate of frameshift mutations during base excision repair.
17267816|a|DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta) is important for the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Overexpression of Pol beta is frequently found in cancer cells and is thought to be associated with tumorigenesis. In this study, we examined BER fidelity in extracts derived from a human lymphoblastoid cell line that over expresses Pol beta compared to normal control cells. Using an in vitro mutagenesis assay, we found an increased rate of frameshift mutations arising during DNA repair in whole-cell extracts derived from the Pol beta-overexpressing cells. We demonstrate that the addition of excess Pol beta to a control cell extract enhances the mutagenic potential of the extract. Furthermore, using cell extracts and purified Pol beta, we demonstrate that the mechanism of frameshift formation involves slippage of Pol beta during the one-nucleotide gap-filling step of BER and that this slippage is fixed by strand-displacement synthesis stimulated by an excess of Pol beta.

17277899|t|Polymorphic Alu insertions and the genetic structure of Iberian Basques.
17277899|a|Eight Alu sequences (ACE, TPA25, PV92, APO, FXIIIB, D1, A25 and B65) were analyzed in two samples from Navarre and Guipuzcoa provinces (Basque Country, Spain). Alu data for other European, Caucasus and North African populations were compiled from the literature for comparison purposes to assess the genetic relationships of the Basques in a broader geographic context. Results of both MDS plot and AMOVA revealed spatial heterogeneity among these three population clusters clearly defined by geography. On the contrary, no substantial genetic heterogeneity was found between the Basque samples, or between Basques and other Europeans (excluding Caucasus populations). Moreover, the genetic information obtained from Alu data conflicts with hypotheses linking the origin of Basques with populations from North Africa (Berbers) or from the Caucasus region (Georgia). In order to explain the reduced genetic heterogeneity detected by Alu insertions among Basque subpopulations, values of the Wright's F(ST )statistic were estimated for both Alu markers and a set of short tandem repeats (STRs) in terms of two geographical scales: (1) the Basque Country, (2) Europe (including Basques). In the Basque area, estimates of Wahlund's effect for both genetic markers showed no statistical difference between Basque subpopulations. However, when this analysis was performed on a European scale, F(ST) values were significantly higher for Alu insertions than for STR alleles. From these results, we suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of the Basque gene pool identified in previous polymorphism studies is relatively recent and probably caused by a differential process of genetic admixture with non-Basque neighboring populations modulated by the effect of a linguistic barrier to random mating.

17304050|t|Genotype/phenotype correlation in 325 individuals referred for a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex in the United States.
17304050|a|Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder marked by hamartoma growth in multiple organ systems. We performed mutational analyses on 325 individuals with definite tuberous sclerosis complex diagnostic status. We identified mutations in 72% (199/257) of de novo and 77% (53/68) of familial cases, with 17% of mutations in the TSC1 gene and 50% in the TSC2 gene. There were 4% unclassified variants and 29% with no mutation identified. Genotype/phenotype analyses of all observed tuberous sclerosis complex findings in probands were performed, including several clinical features not analyzed in two previous large studies. We showed that patients with TSC2 mutations have significantly more hypomelanotic macules and learning disability in contrast to those with TSC1 mutations, findings not noted in previous studies. We also observed results consistent with two similar studies suggesting that individuals with mutations in TSC2 have more severe symptoms. On performing meta-analyses of our data and the other two largest studies in the literature, we found significant correlations for several features that individual studies did not have sufficient power to conclude. Male patients showed more frequent neurologic and eye symptoms, renal cysts, and ungual fibromas. Correlating genotypes with phenotypes should facilitate the disease management of tuberous sclerosis complex.

17304550|t|Disruption of a synaptotagmin (SYT14) associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities.
17304550|a|We report cytogenetic and molecular studies of a de novo, apparently balanced t(1;3)(q32.1;q25.1) identified in a 12-year-old female (designated DGAP128) with cerebral atrophy, macrocephaly seizures, and developmental delay. A combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis demonstrated disruption of a synaptotagmin gene (SYT14) at the 1q32 breakpoint. Expression of SYT14 in human brain was confirmed using Northern analysis. Because members of the synaptotagmin family of proteins function as sensors that link changes in calcium levels with a variety of biological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone-responsiveness, SYT14 is an intriguing candidate gene for the abnormal development in this child. This is the first known constitutional rearrangement of SYT14, and further systematic genetic analysis and clinical studies of DGAP128 may offer unique insights into the role of SYT14 in neurodevelopment.

17318851|t|Interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) contribute to human tooth agenesis.
17318851|a|Phenotypic characteristics expressed in syndromes give clues to the factors involved in the cause of isolated forms of the same defects. We investigated two genes responsible for craniofacial syndromes, FGFR1 and IRF6, in a collection of families with isolated tooth agenesis. Cheek swab samples were obtained for DNA analysis from 116 case/parent trios. Probands had at least one developmentally missing tooth, excluding third molars. In addition, we studied 89 cases and 50 controls from Ohio to replicate any positive findings. Genotyping was performed by kinetic polymerase chain-reaction or TaqMan assays. Linkage disequilibrium analysis and transmission distortion of the marker alleles were performed. The same variants in the IRF6 gene that are associated with isolated orofacial clefts are also associated with human tooth agenesis (rs861019, P = 0.058; rs17015215-V274I, P = 0.0006; rs7802, P = 0.004). Mutations in IRF6 cause Van der Woude and popliteal pterygium syndromes. The craniofacial phenotypic characteristics of these syndromes include oral clefts and preferential tooth agenesis of incisors and premolars, besides pits on the lower lips. Also it appears that preferential premolar agenesis is associated with FGFR1 (P = 0.014) and IRF6 (P = 0.002) markers. There were statistically significant data suggesting that IRF6 interacts not only with MSX1 (P = 0.001), but also with TGFA (P = 0.03).

17345627|t|Over-expression of BMP4 and BMP5 in a child with axial skeletal malformations and heterotopic ossification: a new syndrome.
17345627|a|Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a highly conserved class of signaling molecules that induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation in vivo. Dysregulated expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is found in the cells of patients who have fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a genetic disorder of axial and appendicular skeletal malformation and progressive heterotopic ossification. Loss of function mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein 5 (bmp5) gene leading to under-expression of BMP5 cause the murine short ear syndrome, characterized by small malformed ears and a broad range of axial skeletal malformations. We found features reminiscent of both the short ear mouse and FOP in a child with malformed external ears, multiple malformations of the axial skeleton, and progressive heterotopic ossification in the neck and back. We examined BMP mRNA expression in transformed lymphocytes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and protein expression by ELISA assays and immunohistochemistry. Elevated levels of BMP4 and BMP5 mRNA and protein were detected in the patient's cells while levels of BMP2 mRNA were unchanged. Our data suggest that dysregulated expression of BMP4 and BMP5 genes is associated with an array of human axial skeletal abnormalities similar to the short ear mouse and FOP.

17503474|t|Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of A2BP1/FOX1 as a candidate gene for autism.
17503474|a|Cytogenetic imbalances are increasingly being realized as causes of autism. Here, we report a de novo translocation between the short arms of chromosomes 15 and 16 in a female with autism, epilepsy, and global developmental delay. FISH analysis identified a cryptic deletion of approximately 160 kb at the boundary of the first exon and first intron of the 1.7 Mb ataxin-2 binding protein-1 (A2BP1) gene, also called FOX1. Quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis verified a deletion of exon 1 in the 5' promoter region of the A2BP1 gene. Reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) showed reduced mRNA expression in the individual's lymphocytes, demonstrating the functional consequence of the deletion. A2BP1 codes for a brain-expressed RNA binding or splicing factor. Because of emerging evidence in the role of RNA processing and gene regulation in pervasive developmental disorders, we performed further screening of A2BP1 in additional individuals with autism from the Autism Genetics Resource Exchange (AGRE) collection. Twenty-seven SNPs were genotyped across A2BP1 in 206 parent-child trios and two regions showed association at P < or = 0.008 level. No additional deletions or clear mutations were identified in 88 probands by re-sequencing of all exons and surrounding intronic regions or quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) of exon 1. Although only nominal association was observed, and no obvious causal mutations were identified, these results suggest that A2BP1 may affect susceptibility or cause autism in a subset of patients. Further investigations in a larger sample may provide additional information regarding the involvement of this gene in the autistic phenotype.

17557928|a|The interferon regulatory factor 5 gene (IRF5) has been shown to play a crucial role in harmful immune responses by induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Functional genetic variants associated with increased IRF5 expression of specific isoforms are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and it is possible that they may also predispose to other autoimmune disorders. We tested the association of two IRF5 SNPs, correlated with IRF5 expression and SLE risk, in 947 nuclear family trios type 1 diabetes (T1D) using the transmission disequilibrium test. Our results suggest that the functional IRF5 variations do not confer an obvious risk for T1D.

17627763|t|Single nucleotide polymorphisms of cytokine genes in the healthy Slovak population.
17627763|a|Cytokines are molecules that control and modulate the activities of numerous target cells via binding to specific receptors. The observed differences in the cytokine production among individuals can be, at least partially, explained by gene polymorphisms. Several cytokine gene polymorphisms have been identified to play a role in susceptibility to various diseases, including autoimmune, infectious, allergic or cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the current study was to determine allele and genotype frequencies of 22 polymorphisms in 13 cytokine genes in the healthy Slovak population and to compare them with data available from six populations from Central and Southern Europe. A polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers was used to genotype polymorphisms within genes encoding IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1R, IL-1RA, IL-4Ralpha, IL-12, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 in a sample of 140 unrelated Slovak subjects. The allelic distribution of all polymorphisms in the Slovak population was very close to that in the geographically and historically closest populations in Central Europe--the Czech and the Polish. However, several differences were found between the Slovak and four populations from Southern Europe. The obtained data represent a basis for further studies on association of cytokine gene polymorphisms with some diseases.

17636360|t|Identifying haplotype block structure using an ancestor-derived model.
17636360|a|Recently, haplotype-based association studies have become popular for detecting disease-related or drug-response-associated genes. In these studies, it has been gradually recognized that a haplotype block structure is important. A rational and automatic method for identifying the haplotype block structure from SNP data has been desired. We have developed a new method using an ancestor-derived model and the minimum description length principle. The proposed method was applied to real data on the TAP2 gene in which a recombination hotspot was previously reported in human sperm data. The proposed method could identify an appropriate haplotype block structure, while existing methods failed. The performance of the proposed method was also investigated in a simulation study. The proposed method presented a better performance in real data analysis and the simulation study than existing methods. The proposed method was powerful from the viewpoint of hotspot sensitivity and was robust to mutation except at the edge of a sequence.

17702016|t|A microduplication of CBP in a patient with mental retardation and a congenital heart defect.
17702016|a|Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is a well-characterized genetic syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of CBP in a majority of individuals. In 10% of cases a microdeletion in 16p13.3 affecting CBP is detected. We report on a patient with a de novo 345-480 kb micro-duplication the region, encompassing only CBP and TRAP1. This boy presented with various minor physical anomalies, moderate mental retardation, and an atrial septal defect, but none of the other typical characteristics of the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, such as the broad thumbs and first toes or facial characteristics. This finding implicates CBP as one of the causative genes for the trisomy 16p13 syndrome, and indicates this is a contiguous gene syndrome.

17854670|t|Myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma showing t(2;6)(q31;p21.3) as a sole cytogenetic abnormality.
17854670|a|Myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma (MIFS) is a rare, low-grade sarcoma characterized by distinctive, large, and bizarre Reed--Sternberg--like cells associated with an intense inflammatory infiltrate. The biology of MIFS is still poorly understood, and only two previous cases had been studied cytogenetically. In the present case, analysis of MIFS in the foot of a 53-year-old man revealed the chromosome translocation t(2;6)(q31;p21.3) as the only cytogenetic abnormality. This finding is distinct from the two cases previously reported. Additional studies are needed to verify whether any of these chromosome rearrangements are involved recurrently in MIFS.

17877751|t|Identities, frequencies and origins of TMC1 mutations causing DFNB7/B11 deafness in Pakistan.
17877751|a|Non-syndromic deafness is genetically heterogeneous. We previously reported that mutations of transmembrane channel-like gene 1 (TMC1) cause non-syndromic recessive deafness at the DFNB7/B11 locus on chromosome 9q13-q21 in nine Pakistani families. The goal of this study was to define the identities, origins and frequencies of TMC1 mutations in an expanded cohort of 557 large Pakistani families segregating recessive deafness. We screened affected family members for homozygosity at short-tandem repeats flanking known autosomal recessive (DFNB) deafness loci, followed by TMC1 sequence analysis in families segregating deafness linked to DFNB7/B11. We identified 10 new families segregating DFNB7/B11 deafness and TMC1 mutations, including three novel alleles. Overall, 9 different TMC1 mutations account for deafness in 19 (3.4%) of the 557 Pakistani families. A single mutation, p.R34X, causes deafness in 10 (1.8%) of the families. Genotype analysis of p.R34X-linked markers indicates that it arose from a common founder. We also detected p.R34X among normal control samples of African-American and northern European origins, raising the possibility that p.R34X and other mutations of TMC1 are prevalent contributors to the genetic load of deafness across a variety of populations and continents.

17885622|t|Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic basis for partial protection against alcoholism in Asians, heterozygous for the variant ALDH2*2 gene allele.
17885622|a|OBJECTIVES: It has been well documented that although homozygosity of the variant aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) gene allele, ALDH2*2, in Asians almost fully protects against alcoholism, the heterozygosity only affords a partial protection to varying degrees. The full protection against alcoholism has been ascribed to the low-amount of alcohol hypersensitivity accompanied by a prolonged and large accumulation of acetaldehyde in blood (Peng et al. Pharmacogenetics 1999; 9:463-476). The physiological basis for the partial protection, however, remains unclear. METHODS: To address this question, we recruited a total of 32 adult Han Chinese men, matched by age, body-mass index, and nutritional state from a population base of 404 men. The subjects were divided into 3 combinatorial genotypic groups of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and ALDH, that is, ALDH2*1/*1-ADH1B*1/*1-ADH1C*1/*1 (n=8), ALDH2*1/*1-ADH1B*2/*2-ADH1C*1/*1 (n=8), and ALDH2*1/*2-ADH1B*2/*2-ADH1C*1/*1 (n=16). Following a moderate dose of ethanol (0.5 g/kg body weight), blood ethanol/acetaldehyde/acetate concentrations, cardiac and extracranial/intracranial arterial hemodynamic parameters, as well as self-rated subjective sensations, were measured for 130 min. RESULTS: Heterozygotic ALDH2*1/*2 subjects were found to be strikingly responsive to the moderate amount of alcohol, as evidenced by the prominent cardiovascular effects as well as subjective perceptions of general discomfort for as long as 2 h following ingestion. The ADH1B polymorphisms did not appear to correlate with the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that acetaldehyde, rather than ethanol or acetate, is primarily responsible for the observed alcohol sensitivity reactions and suggest that substantially lower accumulation of blood acetaldehyde in the heterozygotes significantly reduces the aversion reaction to low amounts of alcohol that permits other biological as well as environmental factors to facilitate drinking and the according risk for the disease.

17889706|t|Identification of rare variants in the hLIMD1 gene in breast cancer.
17889706|a|The hLIMD1 gene is located at chromosome 3p21 and was identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene using an elimination test assay. Chromosome 3p21 loci are frequently deleted in a number of cancers, including breast. The 3p21.3 locus harbors a number of tumor suppressor candidates, including LIMD1, a member of the ZYXIN family of genes. LIMD1 directly interacts with RB and is thought to play a role in suppressing tumor growth. To investigate whether mutations in the LIMD1 gene could potentially be involved in breast cancer, we used single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis on DNA from 235 breast cancers and 95 controls. We identified four novel coding region alterations, including two amino acid substitutions at positions 255 and 302. The two remaining novel variants were found at amino acid positions 246 and 647 and encoded silent alterations. The rare Ser255Arg variant was identified in only sporadic breast tumors (2/165 tumors). Some ZYXIN proteins are phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases, and the Ser255Arg change is located in a region phosphorylated on serine residues. Together, the data suggest that this variant may warrant further characterization.

17910067|t|Kidney failure in Townes-Brocks syndrome: an under recognized phenomenon?
17910067|a|Though uncommon, kidney malformations are described in several cases of Townes-Brocks syndrome. By contrast, kidney failure has been reported as the presenting feature of Townes-Brocks syndrome on only one occasion. While the SALL1 gene, mutations of which result in the Townes-Brocks phenotype, is expressed in the developing kidney, the absence of other corroborative reports of kidney failure presenting in affected individuals suggests that the solitary observation of kidney failure is as likely due to chance as to causal association. In now reporting a further instance of this association, we review the literature, demonstrating that several other instances of kidney failure are in fact known, despite an incomplete dataset. These findings suggest that kidney failure may be a constituent element of the natural history of Townes-Brocks syndrome and raise the possible benefits of longitudinal survey for progressive kidney impairment in patients with this syndrome.

17990063|t|Clinical and molecular characterization of Italian patients affected by Cohen syndrome.
17990063|a|Cohen syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with variability in the clinical manifestations, characterized by developmental delay, visual disability, facial dysmorphisms and intermittent neutropenia. We described a cohort of 10 patients affected by Cohen syndrome from nine Italian families ranging from 5 to 52 years at assessment. Characteristic age related facial changes were well documented. Visual anomalies, namely retinopathy and myopia, were present in 9/10 patients (retinopathy in 9/10 and myopia in 8/10). Truncal obesity has been described in all patients older than 6 years (8/8). DNA samples from all patients were analyzed for mutations in COH1 by DHPLC. We detected 15 COH1 alterations most of them were truncating mutations, only one being a missense change. Partial gene deletions have been found in two families. Most mutations were private. Two were already reported in the literature just once. A single base deletion leading to p.T3708fs3769, never reported before, was found in three apparently unrelated families deriving from a restricted area of the Veneto's lowland, between Padova town and Tagliamento river, in heterozygous state. Given the geographical conformation of this region, which is neither geographically or culturally isolated, a recent origin of the mutation could be hypothesized.

18000905|t|Regional analysis on the occurrence of oral clefts in South America.
18000905|a|The aim of this work was to search for unequal birth prevalence rates (BPRs) of cleft lip +/- cleft palate (CL/P), and cleft palate only (CPO), among different geographic areas in South America, and to analyze phenotypic characteristics and associated risk factors in each identified cluster. Included were 5,128 CL/P cases, 1,745 CPO cases, and 3,712 controls (like-sexed, non-malformed liveborn infant, born immediately after a malformed one, in the same hospital), over 4,199,630 consecutive births. They were ascertained between 1967 and 2004, in 190 maternity hospitals of the ECLAMC (Estudio Colaborativo Latinoamericano de Malformaciones Congenitas) network, in 102 cities of all 10 South American countries. Non-predefined geographical areas with significantly unusual cleft BPRs were identified with Kulldorf and Nagarwalla's spatial scan statistic, employing number of cases and births, and exact location of each hospital. Expected values were cleft BPRs registered for the entire ECLAMC hospital network. Syndromic and non-syndromic clefts were considered for cluster analysis, and phenotypic characterization, while only non-syndromic for risk factor analysis. Seven clusters for CL/P, and four for CPO, with unusual BPRs were identified. CL/P cases in high BPR areas were more severe than elsewhere in the sample, similar to a previous ECLAMC report on microtia. For CL/P, high BPR clusters were associated with high altitude above sea level, Amerindian ancestry, and low socioeconomic strata; low BPR clusters showed association with African Black ancestry. Advanced maternal age, a recognized risk factor for CPO, was also associated with the only identified geographic cluster for CPO.

18063669|t|Evidence that common variation in NEDD9 is associated with susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
18063669|a|Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative disorders and in both diseases susceptibility is known to be influenced by genes. We set out to identify novel susceptibility genes for LOAD by performing a large scale, multi-tiered association study testing 4692 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). We identified a SNP within a putative transcription factor binding site in the NEDD9 gene (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated), that shows good evidence of association with disease risk in four out of five LOAD samples [N = 3521, P = 5.38x10(-6), odds ratio (OR) = 1.38 (1.20-1.59)] and in addition, we observed a similar pattern of association in two PD sample sets [N = 1464, P = 0.0145, OR =1.31 (1.05-1.62)]. In exploring a potential mechanism for the association, we observed that expression of NEDD9 and APOE show a strong inverse correlation in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's cases. These data implicate NEDD9 as a novel susceptibility gene for LOAD and possibly PD.

18075470|t|Association between caffeine intake and risk of Parkinson's disease among fast and slow metabolizers.
18075470|a|INTRODUCTION: Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP 1A2) is responsible for more than 90% of caffeine clearance. A polymorphic variant of CYP1A2 (-163C>A) (rs762551) is associated with high CYP1A2 inducibility. Both caffeine and its main metabolite, paraxanthine, may be neuroprotective. The association between caffeine intake and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in fast and slow caffeine metabolizers has not been compared. OBJECTIVE: In a case-control study, we analyzed the relationship between caffeine intake and risk of PD in both fast and slow caffeine metabolizers. METHODS: All the study participants were recruited prospectively, and interviewed for information on the amount and duration of caffeine intake. Genotyping of the CYP1A2 variant was carried out using the allelic discrimination method. RESULTS: Out of 1000 participants who were initially screened, 886 consisting of 418 PD and 468 race, sex and age matched controls were included. No evidence existed to suggest any association between CYP1A2 and the onset of PD (P=0.08). A significant association was seen between caffeine intake and the onset of PD (P=2.01x10(-5)), with the odds ratio for moderate and high drinkers at 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50-1.00] and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65), respectively against the low drinkers. Multivariate analysis revealed no evidence of any interaction effects of caffeine with CYP1A2 (P=0.956). CONCLUSION: The association between caffeine intake and risk of PD was similarly observed in both fast and slow caffeine metabolizers, supporting experimental evidence in animal models that both caffeine and its major metabolite, paraxanthine, are neuroprotective.

18179903|t|Mutation analysis of CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, and RAPSN genes in multiple pterygium syndrome/fetal akinesia patients.
18179903|a|Multiple pterygium syndromes (MPS) comprise a group of multiple congenital anomaly disorders characterized by webbing (pterygia) of the neck, elbows, and/or knees and joint contractures (arthrogryposis). MPS are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous but are traditionally divided into prenatally lethal and nonlethal (Escobar) types. Previously, we and others reported that recessive mutations in the embryonal acetylcholine receptor g subunit (CHRNG) can cause both lethal and nonlethal MPS, thus demonstrating that pterygia resulted from fetal akinesia. We hypothesized that mutations in acetylcholine receptor-related genes might also result in a MPS/fetal akinesia phenotype and so we analyzed 15 cases of lethal MPS/fetal akinesia without CHRNG mutations for mutations in the CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, and rapsyn (RAPSN) genes. No CHRNA1, CHRNB1, or CHRND mutations were detected, but a homozygous RAPSN frameshift mutation, c.1177-1178delAA, was identified in a family with three children affected with lethal fetal akinesia sequence. Previously, RAPSN mutations have been reported in congenital myasthenia. Functional studies were consistent with the hypothesis that whereas incomplete loss of rapsyn function may cause congenital myasthenia, more severe loss of function can result in a lethal fetal akinesia phenotype.

18203180|t|Paternal deletion 6q24.3: a new congenital anomaly syndrome associated with intrauterine growth failure, early developmental delay and characteristic facial appearance.
18203180|a|Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 are relatively uncommon and to date minimal genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed. We report on three unrelated patients with de novo paternal interstitial deletions of 6q24.3. FISH mapping was used to delineate the minimal region of overlap between these three patients. Although all three patients had different size deletions and different breakpoints, two of the patients shared a 2.5 Mb region of overlap and strikingly similar facial features including a triangular face, frontal bossing with metopic prominence, short and upward-slanting palpebral fissures, asymmetry of upper eyelids, hooded eyelids, shallow orbits, prominent inferior orbital crease, wide mouth, and long and flat philtrum. They also had redundant skin, joint laxity, a small thorax, and early developmental delay. The smallest region of overlap between all three patients was a region of deletion less than 1 Mb; all had a history of IUGR and postnatal short stature without overt radiologic skeletal anomalies. The dysmorphic features, early developmental and growth delay may be due to the hemizygous state for one of the genes in the deleted region of two of the patients or to a long range effect of the deletion on expression of other genes. In addition, since imprinted genes have been reported in this region, paternal deletion of an imprinted gene in all three patients may contribute to the growth phenotype. We propose that this is a new congenital malformation syndrome associated with a paternal deletion of 6q24.3.

18262054|a|We describe a novel germline mutation of BMPR1A in a family with juvenile polyposis and colon cancer. This mutation consists of two consecutive substitutions (735-6 TG>AT) that cause two nonsense mutations (Y245X, G246X), inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, on one parental chromosome. This mutation caused protein truncation, and represents a novel case of consecutive nonsense mutations in human disease.

18366737|t|The FH mutation database: an online database of fumarate hydratase mutations involved in the MCUL (HLRCC) tumor syndrome and congenital fumarase deficiency.
18366737|a|BACKGROUND: Fumarate hydratase (HGNC approved gene symbol - FH), also known as fumarase, is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, involved in fundamental cellular energy production. First described by Zinn et al in 1986, deficiency of FH results in early onset, severe encephalopathy. In 2002, the Multiple Leiomyoma Consortium identified heterozygous germline mutations of FH in patients with multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, (MCUL: OMIM 150800). In some families renal cell cancer also forms a component of the complex and as such has been described as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC: OMIM 605839). The identification of FH as a tumor suppressor was an unexpected finding and following the identification of subunits of succinate dehydrogenase in 2000 and 2001, was only the second description of the involvement of an enzyme of intermediary metabolism in tumorigenesis. DESCRIPTION: The FH mutation database is a part of the TCA cycle gene mutation database (formerly the succinate dehydrogenase gene mutation database) and is based on the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) system. The variants included in the database were derived from the published literature and annotated to conform to current mutation nomenclature. The FH database applies HGVS nomenclature guidelines, and will assist researchers in applying these guidelines when directly submitting new sequence variants online. Since the first molecular characterization of an FH mutation by Bourgeron et al in 1994, a series of reports of both FH deficiency patients and patients with MCUL/HLRRC have described 107 variants, of which 93 are thought to be pathogenic. The most common type of mutation is missense (57%), followed by frameshifts & nonsense (27%), and diverse deletions, insertions and duplications. Here we introduce an online database detailing all reported FH sequence variants. CONCLUSION: The FH mutation database strives to systematically unify all current genetic knowledge of FH variants. We believe that this knowledge will assist clinical geneticists and treating physicians when advising patients and their families, will provide a rapid and convenient resource for research scientists, and may eventually assist in gaining novel insights into FH and its related clinical syndromes.

18406868|t|Genetic heterogeneity by comparative genomic hybridization in BRCAx breast cancers.
18406868|a|The chromosomal changes in eight familial BRCAx breast cancers (i.e., negative for BRCA1 or BRCA2) were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to investigate intratumor heterogeneity. This was the first step in a study of most frequent chromosomal aberrations in BRCAx familial breast cancers. Laser microdissection analysis of paraffin tissue samples was followed by whole-genome amplification. CGH was performed on DNA isolated from two to three different cell groups per case to detect any cytogenetic aberrations in important clones that might have been missed when analyzing DNA extracted from large numbers of cells. The results were compared, to evaluate the influence of tumor heterogeneity on CGH, and the heterogeneity was confirmed comparing CGH with fluorescence in situ hybridization results. Different chromosomal aberrations were detected between adjacent clones within the same section, which highlights the utility of microdissection in addressing the problem of heterogeneity in whole-genome studies. Some chromosomal regions were more frequently altered in the eight BRCAx tumors; loss of 2q, 3p, 3q, 8p, 9p, and 15q and gains of 1p, 4p, 4q, 5p, 6q, 12q, and 19p were the most common. Further studies focusing on specific genes and sequences with more sensitive approaches, such as array-CGH, are warranted to confirm these findings.

18409191|t|The infevers autoinflammatory mutation online registry: update with new genes and functions.
18409191|a|Infevers (Internet Fevers; http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/ISSAID/infevers), a website dedicated to mutations responsible for hereditary autoinflammatory diseases, was created in 2002 and has continued to evolve. This new version includes eight genes; six were already present: MEFV, MVK, TNFRSF1A, NLRP3, NOD2, PSTPIP1, and two are new, LPIN2 and NLRP7. Currently, Infevers contains over 540 sequence variants. Several new database functions were recently instituted. The website now accepts confidential data and complex alleles. For each gene, a newly created menu offers: 1) a tabular list of the variants that can be sorted by several parameters; 2) a gene graph providing a schematic representation of the variants along the gene; 3) statistical analysis of the data according to the phenotype, alteration type, and location of the mutation in the gene; 4) the cDNA and gDNA sequences of each gene, showing the nucleotide changes along the sequence, with a color-based code highlighting the gene domains, the first ATG, and the termination codon; and 5) a "download" menu making all tables and figures available for the users, which, except for the gene graphs, are all automatically generated and updated upon submission of the variants. Finally, the entire database was curated to comply with the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) and HGVS nomenclature guidelines, and wherever necessary, an informative note was provided. Infevers has already proven useful for the scientific community with a mean number of visits per month of 200 in 2002 and 800 in 2007, and its new design will lead to a more comprehensive comparative analysis and interpretation of auto-inflammatory sequence variants.

18466102|t|CYP2E1 polymorphisms and gene-environment interactions in the risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers among Indians.
18466102|a|INTRODUCTION: The CYP2E1 enzyme is responsible for the metabolic activation of several procarcinogens into reactive metabolites that result in carcinogenesis. The genetic polymorphisms that modify these enzymatic activities may be associated with upper aerodigestive tract cancer risk. METHODS: This hospital-based study evaluated CYP2E1*1B, CYP2E1*5B and CYP2E1*6 polymorphisms in 408 histopathologically confirmed cases and 220 population-based controls using PCR-RFLP methods. RESULTS: The multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated no significant differences between groups for all three polymorphisms when analyzed separately. However, the gene-environment interactions analyses revealed significant interactions among tobacco smokers (11-20 pack years), 20-40 pack years and > 40 pack years), regular tobacco chewers and alcoholics carrying CYP2E1*1B mutant genotypes. Similarly, CYP2E1*6 polymorphisms resulted in significant interactions among tobacco smokers (> 40 pack years) and regular tobacco chewers on the multiplicative scale. CONCLUSION: The significant gene-environment interactions observed for CYP2E1*1B and CYP2E1*6 polymorphic genotypes may confer a substantial risk for upper aerodigestive tract cancers among Indians.

18487244|t|Depletion of mitochondrial DNA in fibroblast cultures from patients with POLG1 mutations is a consequence of catalytic mutations.
18487244|a|We investigated clinical and cellular phenotypes of 24 children with mutations in the catalytic (alpha) subunit of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gamma polymerase (POLG1). Twenty-one had Alpers syndrome, the commonest severe POLG1 autosomal recessive phenotype, comprising hepatoencephalopathy and often mtDNA depletion. The cellular mtDNA content reflected the genotype more closely than did clinical features. Patients with tissue depletion of mtDNA all had at least one allele with either a missense mutation in a catalytic domain or a nonsense mutation. Four out of 12 patients exhibited a progressive, mosaic pattern of mtDNA depletion in cultured fibroblasts. All these patients had mutations in a catalytic domain in both POLG1 alleles, in either the polymerase or exonuclease domain or both. The tissue mtDNA content of patients who had two linker mutations was normal, and their phenotypes the mildest. Epilepsy and/or movement disorder were major features in all 21. Previous studies have implicated replication stalling as a mechanism for mtDNA depletion. The mosaic cellular depletion that we have demonstrated in cell cultures may be a manifestation of severe replication stalling. One patient with a severe cellular and clinical phenotype was a compound heterozygote with POLG1 mutations in the polymerase and exonuclease domain intrans. This suggests that POLG1 requires both polymerase and 3'-5' exonuclease activity in the same molecule. This is consistent with current functional models for eukaryotic DNA polymerases, which alternate between polymerizing and editing modes, as determined by competition between these two active sites for the 3' end of the DNA.

18521840|t|Identification of novel dyslexia candidate genes through the analysis of a chromosomal deletion.
18521840|a|Dyslexia is the most common childhood learning disorder and it is a significantly heritable trait. At least nine chromosomal loci have been linked to dyslexia, and additional susceptibility loci on other chromosomes have been suggested. Within two of these loci, DYX1C1 (15q21) and ROBO1 (3p12) have recently been proposed as dyslexia candidate genes through the molecular analysis of translocation breakpoints in dyslexic individuals carrying balanced chromosomal translocations. Moreover, genetic association studies have indicated a cluster of five dyslexia candidate genes in another linkage region on chromosome 6p22, although there is currently no consensus about which of these five genes contributes to the genetic susceptibility for dyslexia. In this article, we report the identification of four new dyslexia candidate genes (PCNT, DIP2A, S100B, and PRMT2) on chromosome region 21q22.3 by FISH and SNP microarray analyses of a very small deletion in this region, which cosegregates with dyslexia in a father and his three sons.

18543312|t|Granulin mutations associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration and related disorders: an update.
18543312|a|Mutations in the gene encoding granulin (HUGO gene symbol GRN, also referred to as progranulin, PGRN), located at chromosome 17q21, were recently linked to tau-negative ubiquitin-positive frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLDU). Since then, 63 heterozygous mutations were identified in 163 families worldwide, all leading to loss of functional GRN, implicating a haploinsufficiency mechanism. Together, these mutations explained 5 to 10% of FTLD. The high mutation frequency, however, might still be an underestimation because not all patient samples were examined for all types of loss-of-function mutations and because several variants, including missense mutations, have a yet uncertain pathogenic significance. Although the complete phenotypic spectrum associated with GRN mutations is not yet fully characterized, it was shown that it is highly heterogeneous, suggesting the influence of modifying factors. A role of GRN in neuronal survival was suggested but the exact mechanism by which neurodegeneration and deposition of pathologic brain inclusions occur still has to be clarified.

18648394|t|LDLR promoter variant and exon 14 mutation on the same chromosome are associated with an unusually severe FH phenotype and treatment resistance.
18648394|a|Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common form of autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia, and is caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Heterozygous FH is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and early-onset cardiovascular disease, whereas homozygous FH results in more severe LDL cholesterol elevation with death by 20 years of age. We present here the case of an African-American female FH patient presenting with a myocardial infarction at the age of 48, recurrent angina pectoris and numerous coronary artery stents. Her pretreated LDL cholesterol levels were more typical of a homozygous FH pattern and she was resistant to conventional lipid-lowering treatment, yet her other clinical parameters were not necessarily consistent with homozygous FH. Genetic testing revealed two LDLR variants on the same chromosome: one a novel missense mutation in exon 14 (Cys681Gly) and the other a promoter variant (IVS1-217C>T) previously shown to result in increased LDLR transcription. Disease-associated PCSK9 or APOB mutations were not identified in this individual. Overall, her genetic and clinical profile suggests that enhanced expression of the mutant LDLR allele resulted in a severe phenotype with characteristics of both heterozygous and homozygous FH.

18772193|t|Novel suppressors of alpha-synuclein toxicity identified using yeast.
18772193|a|The mechanism by which the Parkinson's disease-related protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) causes neurodegeneration has not been elucidated. To determine the genes that protect cells from alpha-syn, we used a genetic screen to identify suppressors of the super sensitivity of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing alpha-syn to killing by hydrogen peroxide. Forty genes in ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism, protein biosynthesis, vesicle trafficking and the response to stress were identified. Five of the forty genes--ENT3, IDP3, JEM1, ARG2 and HSP82--ranked highest in their ability to block alpha-syn-induced reactive oxygen species accumulation, and these five genes were characterized in more detail. The deletion of any of these five genes enhanced the toxicity of alpha-syn as judged by growth defects compared with wild-type cells expressing alpha-syn, which indicates that these genes protect cells from alpha-syn. Strikingly, four of the five genes are specific for alpha-syn in that they fail to protect cells from the toxicity of the two inherited mutants A30P or A53T. This finding suggests that alpha-syn causes toxicity to cells through a different pathway than these two inherited mutants. Lastly, overexpression of Ent3p, which is a clathrin adapter protein involved in protein transport between the Golgi and the vacuole, causes alpha-syn to redistribute from the plasma membrane into cytoplasmic vesicular structures. Our interpretation is that Ent3p mediates the transport of alpha-syn to the vacuole for proteolytic degradation. A similar clathrin adaptor protein, epsinR, exists in humans.

18794729|t|Polymorphism of the hepatic influx transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 is associated with increased cholesterol synthesis rate.
18794729|a|We investigated the influence of SLCO1B1 polymorphism on cholesterol synthesis and absorption during baseline, and as affected by statins. In a crossover study, 32 healthy volunteers with different SLCO1B1 genotypes ingested a single dose of fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin. Plasma total cholesterol, and cholesterol synthesis and absorption markers were measured before statin administration and up to 12 h thereafter. The mean fasting baseline plasma desmosterol to cholesterol ratio was 40% higher in participants with the SLCO1B1 c.521CC variant genotype than in those with the c.521TT genotype (P=0.043). The genotype had no significant effect on cholesterol absorption markers. All statins decreased lathosterol and avenasterol to cholesterol ratios, but no significant differences in the response existed between SLCO1B1 genotypes. In conclusion, the low activity SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype is associated with an increased cholesterol synthesis rate. The short-term effects of statins on cholesterol homeostasis were not associated with the SLCO1B1 polymorphism.

18805828|t|Association of a null allele of SPRN with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
18805828|a|BACKGROUND: No susceptibility genes have been identified in human prion disase, apart from the prion protein gene (PRNP). The gene SPRN, encodes Shadoo (Sho, shadow of prion protein) which has protein homology and possible functional links with the prion protein. METHODS: A genetic screen was carried out of the open reading frame of SPRN by direct sequencing in 522 patients with prion disease, including 107 with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), and 861 healthy controls. RESULTS: A common coding variant of SPRN, two further single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and three rare insertion or deletion variants were found. A single base-pair insertion at codon 46, predicted to cause a frameshift and potentially a novel protein, was found in two patients with vCJD but not in controls (p = 0.01). Two linked SNPs, one in intron 1 and the other a missense variant at codon 7, were associated with risk of sporadic CJD (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: These data justify the functional genetic characterisation of SPRN and support the involvement of Shadoo in prion pathobiology.

18951438|t|Locus-specific databases and recommendations to strengthen their contribution to the classification of variants in cancer susceptibility genes.
18951438|a|Locus-specific databases (LSDBs) are curated collections of sequence variants in genes associated with disease. LSDBs of cancer-related genes often serve as a critical resource to researchers, diagnostic laboratories, clinicians, and others in the cancer genetics community. LSDBs are poised to play an important role in disseminating clinical classification of variants. The IARC Working Group on Unclassified Genetic Variants has proposed a new system of five classes of variants in cancer susceptibility genes. However, standards are lacking for reporting and analyzing the multiple data types that assist in classifying variants. By adhering to standards of transparency and consistency in the curation and annotation of data, LSDBs can be critical for organizing our understanding of how genetic variation relates to disease. In this article we discuss how LSDBs can accomplish these goals, using existing databases for BRCA1, BRCA2, MSH2, MLH1, TP53, and CDKN2A to illustrate the progress and remaining challenges in this field. We recommend that: 1) LSDBs should only report a conclusion related to pathogenicity if a consensus has been reached by an expert panel. 2) The system used to classify variants should be standardized. The Working Group encourages use of the five class system described in this issue by Plon and colleagues. 3) Evidence that supports a conclusion should be reported in the database, including sources and criteria used for assignment. 4) Variants should only be classified as pathogenic if more than one type of evidence has been considered. 5) All instances of all variants should be recorded.

18991055|t|Association between polymorphisms in SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, FTO, WFS1, CDKAL1, KCNQ1 and type 2 diabetes in the Korean population.
18991055|a|According to recent genome-wide association studies, a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of the present study was to investigate the association among the polymorphisms of SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, FTO, WFS1, CDKAL1 and KCNQ1 and the risk of T2DM in the Korean population. This study was based on a multicenter case-control study, including 908 patients with T2DM and 502 non-diabetic controls. We genotyped rs13266634, rs1111875, rs10811661, rs4402960, rs8050136, rs734312, rs7754840 and rs2237892 and measured the body weight, body mass index and fasting plasma glucose in all patients and controls. The strongest association was found in a variant of CDKAL1 [rs7754840, odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.50-2.10, p = 5.0 x 10(-11)]. The G allele of rs1111875 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.18-1.72, p = 1.8 x 10(-4)) in HHEX), the T allele of rs10811661 (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.23-1.75, p = 2.1 x 10(-5)) in CDKN2A/B) and the C allele of rs2237892 (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.10-1.56, p = 0.003) in KCNQ1 showed significant associations with T2DM. Rs13266634 (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.00-1.42, p = 0.045) in SLC30A8 showed a nominal association with the risk of T2DM, whereas SNPs in IGF2BP2, FTO and WFS1 were not associated. In conclusion, we have shown that SNPs in HHEX, CDKN2A/B, CDKAL1, KCNQ1 and SLC30A8 confer a risk of T2DM in the Korean population.

19092437|t|Clinical practice and genetic counseling for cystic fibrosis and CFTR-related disorders.
19092437|a|Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-related disorders encompass a disease spectrum from focal male reproductive tract involvement in congenital absence of the vas deferens to multiorgan involvement in classic cystic fibrosis. The reproductive, gastrointestinal, and exocrine manifestations of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator deficiency are correlated with CFTR genotype, whereas the respiratory manifestations that are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis are less predictable. Molecular genetic testing of CFTR has led to new diagnostic strategies and will enable targeting of molecular therapies now in development. Older diagnostic methods that measure sweat chloride and nasal potential difference nonetheless remain important because of their sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen and the genotyping of CFTR alleles are key to newborn screening programs because of low cost. The multiorgan nature of cystic fibrosis leads to a heavy burden of care, thus therapeutic regimens are tailored to the specific manifestations present in each patient. The variability of cystic fibrosis lung disease and the variable expressivity of mild CFTR alleles complicate genetic counseling for this autosomal recessive disorder. Widespread implementation of newborn screening programs among populations with significant cystic fibrosis mutation carrier frequencies is expected to result in increasing demands on genetic counseling resources.

19104840|t|Breakpoint mapping and haplotype analysis of three reciprocal translocations identify a novel recurrent translocation in two unrelated families: t(4;11)(p16.2;p15.4).
19104840|a|The majority of constitutional reciprocal translocations appear to be unique rearrangements arising from independent events. However, a small number of translocations are recurrent, most significantly the t(11;22)(q23;q11). Among large series of translocations there may be multiple independently ascertained cases with the same cytogenetic breakpoints. Some of these could represent additional recurrent rearrangements, alternatively they could be identical by descent (IBD) or have subtly different breakpoints when examined under higher resolution. We have used molecular breakpoint mapping and haplotyping to determine the origin of three pairs of reciprocal constitutional translocations, each with the same cytogenetic breakpoints. FISH mapping showed one pair to have different breakpoints and thus to be distinct rearrangements. Another pair of translocations were IBD with identical breakpoint intervals and highly conserved haplotypes on the derived chromosomes. The third pair, t(4;11)(p16.2;p15.4), had the same breakpoint intervals by aCGH and fosmid mapping but had very different haplotypes, therefore they represent a novel recurrent translocation. Unlike the t(11;22)(q23;q11), the formation of the t(4;11)(p16.2;p15.4) may have involved segmental duplications and sequence homology at the breakpoints. Additional examples of recurrent translocations could be identified if the resources were available to study more translocations using the approaches described here. However, like the t(4;11)(p16.2;p15.4), such translocations are likely to be rare with the t(11;22) remaining the only common recurrent constitutional reciprocal translocation.

19104841|t|Alterations of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 loci in early dysplastic lesions of head and neck: clinical and prognostic implications.
19104841|a|Deletion of chromosomal 3p12.3 was suggested to be associated with dysplastic lesions of head and neck. This region harbors two candidate tumor suppressors ROBO1/DUTT1, ROBO2 and two non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) located at intron 2 of ROBO1/DUTT1. Aim of this study is to understand the role of these genes in development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. A collection of 72 dysplastic lesions and 116 HNSCC samples and two oral cancer cell lines were analyzed for ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 deletion and promoter methylation. ROBO1/DUTT1, ROBO2 and two ncRNAs mRNA expression were analyzed by Q-PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 was performed. Alterations of these genes were correlated with different clinicopathological parameters. High frequency of molecular alterations (deletion/methylation) was seen in ROBO1/DUTT1 than ROBO2. In mild dysplastic lesions both of these genes showed high molecular alterations and remained more or less constant in subsequent stages. Q-PCR analysis showed reduced expression of these genes and the two ncRNAs. In vitro demethylation experiment by 5-aza-dC showed upregulation of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 while the expression of the ncRNAs remained unchanged. Immunohistochemical analysis of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 showed concordance with their mRNA expression and molecular alterations. Poor patients' outcome was predicted in the cases with alteration of ROBO1/DUTT1 along with tobacco addiction and nodal involvement. Our data suggests (a) ROBO1/DUTT1 and the ncRNAs are transcribed from different promoters, and (b) inactivation of ROBO1/DUTT1 could be used as molecular signature for early detection and prognosis of the head and neck cancer.

19124645|t|Familial occurrence of schwannomas and malignant rhabdoid tumour associated with a duplication in SMARCB1.
19124645|a|BACKGROUND: The role of germline and somatic SMARCB1 gene mutations in malignant rhabdoid tumour (MRT) predisposition is well known. Germline SMARCB1 mutations have also recently been identified in a subset of individuals with schwannomatosis. Surprisingly, MRT predisposition and schwannomatosis have never been reported to co-occur in a family. The correlation between genotype and phenotype for mutations in SMARCB1 has not been determined. RESULTS: We have identified a germline 2631 bp duplication that includes exon 6 of SMARCB1 in a unique family with a four generation history of MRT predisposition and schwannomatosis. This duplication segregates with disease in individuals affected with both conditions, linking MRT predisposition and schwannomatosis as components of the same syndrome in this family. CONCLUSION: The unique combination of tumours that result from the duplication described in this report may provide important clues about the mechanisms that influence the phenotype associated with a given SMARCB1 mutation.

19160446|t|P2RX7: A bipolar and unipolar disorder candidate susceptibility gene?
19160446|a|The chromosomal region 12q24 has been previously implicated by linkage studies of both bipolar disorder and unipolar mood disorder and we have reported two pedigrees segregating both bipolar disorder and Darier's disease that show linkage across this region. The gene P2RX7 is located in this chromosomal region and has been recently reported as a susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. The non-synonymous SNP rs2230912 (resulting in amino-acid polymorphism Q460R) showed the strongest association and has been postulated to be pathogenically relevant. We have investigated this gene in a large UK case-control sample (bipolar I disorder N = 687, unipolar recurrent major depression N = 1,036, controls N = 1,204). Neither rs2230912 nor any of 8 other SNPs genotyped across P2RX7 was found to be associated with mood disorder in general, nor specifically with bipolar or unipolar disorder. Further, sequencing of our two chromosome 12-linked bipolar-Darier families showed no evidence of rare variants at P2RX7 that could explain the linkage. Our data do not provide support for rs2230912 or the other polymorphisms studied within the P2RX7 locus, being involved in susceptibility to mood disorders.

19207031|t|Growth hormone dose in growth hormone-deficient adults is not associated with IGF-1 gene polymorphisms.
19207031|a|AIMS: Several SNPs and a microsatellite cytosine-adenine repeat promoter polymorphism of the IGF-1 gene have been reported to be associated with circulating IGF-1 serum concentrations. Variance in IGF-1 concentrations due to genetic variations may affect different response to growth hormone (GH) treatment, resulting in different individually required GH-doses in GH-deficient patients. The aim of this study was to test if the IGF-1 gene polymorphisms are associated with the GH-dose of GH-deficient adults. MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of nine tagging SNPs, five additionally selected SNPs and a cytosine-adenine repeat polymorphism were determined in 133 German adult patients (66 men, 67 women; mean age 45.4 years +/- 13.1 standard deviation; majority Caucasian) with GH-deficiency (GHD) of different origin, derived from the prospective Pfizer International Metabolic Study (KIMS) Pharmacogenetics Study. Patients received GH-treatment for 12 months with finished dose-titration of GH and centralized IGF-1 measurements. GH-dose after 1 year of treatment, IGF-1 concentrations, IGF-1-standard deviation score (SDS), the IGF-1:GH ratio and anthropometric data were analyzed by genotype. RESULTS: Except for rs1019731, which showed a significant difference of IGF-1-SDS by genotypes (p = 0.02), all polymorphisms showed no associations with the GH-doses, IGF-1 concentrations, IGF-1-SDS and IGF-1:GH ratio after adjusting for the confounding variables gender, age and BMI. CONCLUSION: IGF-1 gene polymorphisms were not associated with the responsiveness to exogenous GH in GHD. Therefore, genetic variations of the IGF-1 gene seem not to be major influencing factors of the GH-IGF-axis causing variable response to exogenous GH-treatment.

19208385|t|Osteogenesis imperfecta type III with intracranial hemorrhage and brachydactyly associated with mutations in exon 49 of COL1A2.
19208385|a|Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable bone disorder characterized by fractures with minimal trauma. Intracranial hemorrhage has been reported in a small number of OI patients. Here we describe three patients, a boy (aged 15 years) and two girls (aged 17 and 7 years) with OI type III who suffered intracranial hemorrhage and in addition had brachydactyly and nail hypoplasia. In all of these patients, OI was caused by glycine mutations affecting exon 49 of the COL1A2 gene, which codes for the most carboxy-terminal part of the triple-helical domain of the collagen type I alpha 2 chain. These observations suggest that mutations in this region of the collagen type I alpha 2 chain carry a high risk of abnormal limb development and intracranial bleeding.

19224586|t|Quantitative PCR high-resolution melting (qPCR-HRM) curve analysis, a new approach to simultaneously screen point mutations and large rearrangements: application to MLH1 germline mutations in Lynch syndrome.
19224586|a|Several techniques have been developed to screen mismatch repair (MMR) genes for deleterious mutations. Until now, two different techniques were required to screen for both point mutations and large rearrangements. For the first time, we propose a new approach, called "quantitative PCR (qPCR) high-resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis (qPCR-HRM)," which combines qPCR and HRM to obtain a rapid and cost-effective method suitable for testing a large series of samples. We designed PCR amplicons to scan the MLH1 gene using qPCR HRM. Seventy-six patients were fully scanned in replicate, including 14 wild-type patients and 62 patients with known mutations (57 point mutations and five rearrangements). To validate the detected mutations, we used sequencing and/or hybridization on a dedicated MLH1 array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). All point mutations and rearrangements detected by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC)+multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were successfully detected by qPCR HRM. Three large rearrangements were characterized with the dedicated MLH1 array-CGH. One variant was detected with qPCR HRM in a wild-type patient and was located within the reverse primer. One variant was not detected with qPCR HRM or with dHPLC due to its proximity to a T-stretch. With qPCR HRM, prescreening for point mutations and large rearrangements are performed in one tube and in one step with a single machine, without the need for any automated sequencer in the prescreening process. In replicate, its reagent cost, sensitivity, and specificity are comparable to those of dHPLC+MLPA techniques. However, qPCR HRM outperformed the other techniques in terms of its rapidity and amount of data provided.

19370769|t|SCA-LSVD: a repeat-oriented locus-specific variation database for genotype to phenotype correlations in spinocerebellar ataxias.
19370769|a|Repeat expansion has been implicated in 10 out of 17 candidate genes identified for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs)-commonly referred as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Though genetically distinct, the SCAs share a large number of features that confound their clinical classification. In addition, there is a difference in the prevalence and phenotypic expression of ataxias between different ethnic groups. We have created a new SCA-locus-specific variation database (LSVD) that aims to catalog and integrate information on SCAs associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion (SCA1, SCA 2, SCA 3, SCA 6, SCA 7, SCA 8, SCA 12, SCA 17, Friedreich's ataxia [FRDA], and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA]) from all over the world. The database has been developed using the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) software (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). The database houses detailed information on clinical features, such as age and symptom at onset, mode of inheritance, and genotype information, pertaining to the SCA patients from more than 400 families across India. All the compiled genotype data conforms to the HGVS Nomenclature guidelines. This would be a very useful starting point for understanding the molecular correlates of phenotypes in ataxia-a multilocus disease in which related molecular mechanisms converge to overlapping phenotypes.

19450126|t|Systematic screening for polymorphisms within the UGT1A6 gene in three Chinese populations and function prediction through structural modeling.
19450126|a|AIMS: To date, there have been relatively few studies on the UGT1A6 gene in the Chinese population. The present study was designed to determine the allele frequencies and haplotypes of this gene in the population and predict the candidate functional mutations. MATERIALS & METHODS: We carried out the first systematic screening of polymorphisms of the gene in an SNP analysis involving 1074 Chinese subjects from three ethnic groups, namely Han, Dong and She, using direct sequencing. We identified the putative substrate binding pocket using a homology-modeled structure and produced a practical model for predicting the function of polymorphisms in UGT1A6. RESULTS: A total of six SNPs and 10 mutations were detected including nine known and seven novel ones. The novel mutations were 73G>A (V25I), 89T>G (L30R), 222A>C, 657C>A, 773A>T (D258V), 1040A>G (N347S) and 1467C>T. In addition, we detected, for the first time in the Chinese population, SNPs 105C>T, 627G>T as well as mutations 308C>A (S103X), IVS2+15T>C and 1088C>T (P363L). Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed among 19T>G, 315A>G, 541A>G and 552A>C. There were seven haplotypes whose frequencies were more than 0.01 in one or more of the three ethnic groups. P363L in the C-terminal domain might weaken the binding of cofactor UDPGA to the domain and induce a poor metabolism genotype of UGT1A6. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that genetic polymorphisms in UGT1A6 may contribute to interindividual and intra-ethnic differences. The results should prove helpful in the development of pharmacogenomics in China.

19483196|t|Vascular endothelial growth factor gene polymorphisms as prognostic markers for ocular manifestations in pseudoxanthoma elasticum.
19483196|a|Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a heritable disorder affecting the skin, eyes and cardiovascular system. It is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene and its clinical picture is highly variable. PXE often leads to severe visual impairment due to the development of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). CNV in PXE-associated retinopathy is believed to be mediated by the action of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The objective of the present study was to evaluate a possible impact of variations in the VEGFA gene on ocular manifestations of PXE. For this purpose, we evaluated the distribution of 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter and coding region of the VEGFA gene in DNA samples from 163 German patients affected by PXE and in 163 healthy control subjects. Haplotype analysis of SNPs c.-1540A>C, c.-460C>T, c.-152G>A, c.405C>G, c.674C>T, c.1032C>T, c.4618C>T and c.5092C>A revealed that the haplotype CTGGCCCC was associated with PXE (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.33-3.15, P(corrected) = 0.01). Furthermore, five SNPs showed significant association with severe retinopathy. The most significant single SNP association was c.-460C>T (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.01-7.31, P(corrected) = 0.0003). Logistic regression analysis identified the c.-460T and the c.674C alleles as independent risk factors for development of severe retinopathy. Our findings suggest an involvement of VEGF in the pathogenesis of ocular PXE manifestations. VEGF gene polymorphisms might prove useful as prognostic markers for the development of PXE-associated retinopathy and permit earlier therapeutic intervention in order to prevent loss of central vision, one of the most devastating consequences of this disease.

19508969|t|Hypomorphic mutations in meckelin (MKS3/TMEM67) cause nephronophthisis with liver fibrosis (NPHP11).
19508969|a|BACKGROUND: Nephronophthisis (NPHP), a rare recessive cystic kidney disease, is the most frequent genetic cause of chronic renal failure in children and young adults. Mutations in nine genes (NPHP1-9) have been identified. NPHP can be associated with retinal degeneration (Senior-Loken syndrome), brainstem and cerebellar anomalies (Joubert syndrome), or liver fibrosis. METHODS: To identify a causative gene for the subset of patients with associated liver fibrosis, the authors performed a genome wide linkage search in a consanguineous family with three affected patients using 50K SNP microarrays and homozygosity mapping. RESULTS: The authors obtained a significant maximum parametric LOD (logarithm of odds) score of Z(max) = 3.72 on chromosome 8q22 and identified a homozygous missense mutation in the gene MKS3/TMEM67. When examining a worldwide cohort of 62 independent patients with NPHP and associated liver fibrosis we identified altogether four novel mutations (p.W290L, p.C615R, p.G821S, and p.G821R) in five of them. Mutations of MKS3/TMEM67, found recently in Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) type 3 and Joubert syndrome (JBTS) type 6, are predominantly truncating mutations. In contrast, the mutations detected here in patients with NPHP and associated liver fibrosis are exclusively missense mutations. This suggests that they may represent hypomorphic alleles, leading to a milder phenotype compared with the more severe MKS or JBTS phenotype. Additionally, mutation analysis for MKS3/TMEM67 in 120 patients with JBTS yielded seven different (four novel) mutations in five patients, four of whom also presented with congenital liver fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Hypomorphic MKS3/TMEM67 mutations cause NPHP with liver fibrosis (NPHP11). This is the first report of MKS3 mutations in patients with no vermian agenesis and without neurological signs. Thus NPHP, JBTS, and MKS represent allelic disorders.

19521967|t|The role of the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism in the phenotypic expression of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
19521967|a|Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions and compulsions, and shows considerable phenotypic variability. Family and twin studies have indicated a genetic component in the etiology of OCD, and the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) gene is an important candidate gene for OCD. This study investigates the influence of the functional COMT Val158Met polymorphism on the phenotypic expression of OCD, using an item-level factor-analytic approach in a large sample. The COMT Val158Met variant was genotyped in 373 patients and 462 controls. It was tested whether there was an association between the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and OCD or dimensional phenotypes such as YBOCS severity score, age of onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and six symptom dimensions recently found in a large item-level factor-analytic study [Katerberg et al., submitted]. We further investigated possible sex-specific associations between the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and OCD or dimensional phenotypes. There was a trend for an association of the COMT 158Met allele with OCD in males, and an interaction between the COMT Val158Met genotype and sex on the somatic and sensory phenomena symptom dimension, with females showing lower scores. In conclusion, a dimensional approach seems fruitful in detecting genes of importance for OCD.

19578788|t|UVB radiation induces human lens epithelial cell migration via NADPH oxidase-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases.
19578788|a|Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is one of the important cataract risk factors. The migration of human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) plays a crucial role in the remodeling of lens capsule and cataract formation. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of UV-induced lens cell migration. We found that UVB radiation induces cell migration in cultured human lens epithelial cells. Further, we observed that UVB radiation induces NADPH oxidase activity and ROS generation which are inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium or DPI and antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). In addition, DPI and EGCG also block UVB irradiation-induced MMP-2, and -9 activity and expression and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Collectively, our data suggest that NADPH oxidase may be a major source for the UVB-induced ROS generation, and it plays an essential role in the activation of NF-kappaB, which is involved in the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and cell migration induced by UVB in HELCs. Understanding the cell signaling pathways may constitute potential therapeutic targets in for UVB-induced cataract.

19664744|t|A genome-wide in vitro bacterial-infection screen reveals human variation in the host response associated with inflammatory disease.
19664744|a|Recent progress in cataloguing common genetic variation has made possible genome-wide studies that are beginning to elucidate the causes and consequences of our genetic differences. Approaches that provide a mechanistic understanding of how genetic variants function to alter disease susceptibility and why they were substrates of natural selection would complement other approaches to human-genome analysis. Here we use a novel cell-based screen of bacterial infection to identify human variation in Salmonella-induced cell death. A loss-of-function allele of CARD8, a reported inhibitor of the proinflammatory protease caspase-1, was associated with increased cell death in vitro (p = 0.013). The validity of this association was demonstrated through overexpression of alternative alleles and RNA interference in cells of varying genotype. Comparison of mammalian CARD8 orthologs and examination of variation among different human populations suggest that the increase in infectious-disease burden associated with larger animal groups (i.e., herds and colonies), and possibly human population expansion, may have naturally selected for loss of CARD8. We also find that the loss-of-function CARD8 allele shows a modest association with an increased risk of systemic inflammatory response syndrome in a small study (p = 0.05). Therefore, a by-product of the selected benefit of loss of CARD8 could be increased inflammatory diseases. These results demonstrate the utility of genome-wide cell-based association screens with microbes in the identification of naturally selected variants that can impact human health.

19696792|t|Single nucleotide polymorphism in ABCG2 is associated with irinotecan-induced severe myelosuppression.
19696792|a|Irinotecan is an anti-neoplastic agent that is widely used for treating colorectal and lung cancers, but often causes toxicities such as severe myelosuppression and diarrhea. In this study, we performed a two-stage case-control association study for irinotecan-induced severe myelosuppression (grades 3 and 4). In the first stage, 23 patients who developed severe myelosuppression and 58 patients who did not develop any toxicity were examined for 170 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 genes involved in the metabolism and transport of irinotecan. A total of five SNPs were identified to show the possible association with severe myelosuppression (P(Fisher)<0.01) and were further examined in 7 cases and 20 controls in the second stage of the study. An intronic SNP, rs2622604, in ABCG2 showed P(Fisher)=0.0419 in the second stage and indicated a significant association with severe myelosuppression in the combined study (P(Fisher)=0.000237; P(Corrected)=0.036). Although only limited subjects were investigated, our results suggested that a genetic polymorphism in ABCG2 might alter the transport activity for the drug and elevate the systemic circulation level of irinotecan, leading to severe myelosuppression.

19779499|t|Novel CACNA1S mutation causes autosomal dominant hypokalemic periodic paralysis in a South American family.
19779499|a|Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder, which is characterized by periodic attacks of muscle weakness associated with a decrease in the serum potassium level. A major disease-causing gene for HypoPP has been identified as CACNA1S, which encodes the skeletal muscle calcium channel alpha-subunit with four transmembrane domains (I-IV), each with six transmembrane segments (S1-S6). To date, all CACNA1S mutations identified in HypoPP patients are located within the voltage-sensor S4 segment. In this study we report a novel CACNA1S mutation in a new region of the protein, the S3 segment of domain III. We characterized a four-generation South American family with HypoPP. Genetic analysis identified a novel V876E mutation in all HypoPP patients in the family, but not in normal family members or 160 control people. Clinical analysis indicates that mutation V876E is associated with a severe outcome as characterized by a very early age of onset, complete penetrance and a severe prognosis including death. These results identify a new mutation in CACNA1S and expand the spectrum of CACNA1S mutations associated with HypoPP.

19891556|t|Clopidogrel pharmacogenomics and risk of inadequate platelet inhibition: US FDA recommendations.
19891556|a|Antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel is the current standard of care for coronary artery disease patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention. However, approximately 25% of patients experience a subtherapeutic antiplatelet response. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that undergoes hepatic biotransformation by CYP2C19 into its active metabolite. Several studies have reported that, compared with wild-type individuals, CYP2C19 variant allele carriers exhibit a significantly lower capacity to metabolize clopidogrel into its active metabolite and inhibit platelet activation, and are therefore at significantly higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Consequently, the US FDA has recently changed clopidogrel's prescribing information to highlight the impact of CYP2C19 genotype on clopidogrel pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical response. Future studies remain necessary to develop effective personalized therapeutic strategies for CYP2C19 variant allele carriers and other individuals at risk for clopidogrel nonresponsiveness.

19896957|t|DNA fragmentation in human fibroblasts under extremely low frequency electromagnetic field exposure.
19896957|a|Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) were reported to affect DNA integrity in human cells with evidence based on the Comet assay. These findings were heavily debated for two main reasons; the lack of reproducibility, and the absence of a plausible scientific rationale for how EMFs could damage DNA. Starting out from a replication of the relevant experiments, we performed this study to clarify the existence and explore origin and nature of ELF-EMF induced DNA effects. Our data confirm that intermittent (but not continuous) exposure of human primary fibroblasts to a 50 Hz EMF at a flux density of 1 mT induces a slight but significant increase of DNA fragmentation in the Comet assay, and we provide first evidence for this to be caused by the magnetic rather than the electric field. Moreover, we show that EMF-induced responses in the Comet assay are dependent on cell proliferation, suggesting that processes of DNA replication rather than the DNA itself may be affected. Consistently, the Comet effects correlated with a reduction of actively replicating cells and a concomitant increase of apoptotic cells in exposed cultures, whereas a combined Fpg-Comet test failed to produce evidence for a notable contribution of oxidative DNA base damage. Hence, ELF-EMF induced effects in the Comet assay are reproducible under specific conditions and can be explained by minor disturbances in S-phase processes and occasional triggering of apoptosis rather than by the generation of DNA damage.

19953639|t|Molecular and clinical heterogeneity in CLCN7-dependent osteopetrosis: report of 20 novel mutations.
19953639|a|The "Osteopetroses" are genetic diseases whose clinical picture is caused by a defect in bone resorption by osteoclasts. Three main forms can be distinguished on the basis of severity, age of onset and means of inheritance: the dominant benign, the intermediate and the recessive severe form. While several genes have been involved in the pathogenesis of the different types of osteopetroses, the CLCN7 gene has drawn the attention of many researchers, as mutations within this gene are associated with very different phenotypes. We report here the characterization of 25 unpublished patients which has resulted in the identification of 20 novel mutations, including 11 missense mutations, 6 causing premature termination, 1 small deletion and 2 putative splice site defects. Careful analysis of clinical and molecular data led us to several conclusions. First, intermediate osteopetrosis is not homogeneous, since it can comprise both severe dominant forms with an early onset and recessive ones without central nervous system involvement. Second, the appropriateness of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in CLCN7-dependent ARO patients has to be carefully evaluated and exhaustive CNS examination is strongly suggested, as transplantation can almost completely cure the disease in situations where no primary neurological symptoms are present. Finally, the analysis of this largest cohort of CLCN7-dependent ARO patients together with some ADO II families allowed us to draw preliminary genotype-phenotype correlations suggesting that haploinsufficiency is not the mechanism causing ADO II. The availability of biochemical assays to characterize ClC-7 function will help to confirm this hypothesis.

20031581|t|Association and functional analyses of MEF2A as a susceptibility gene for premature myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease.
20031581|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in the MEF2A gene, coding for a member of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 family of transcription factors, have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (MI). In particular, a 21-bp deletion and 3 missense mutations were demonstrated either to reduce MEF2A transcriptional activity or to impair its nuclear translocation. However, the association of MEF2A with coronary artery disease/MI was not confirmed in other studies. We analyzed the role of MEF2A in the pathogenesis of MI in 2008 Italian patients with premature MI and in 2008 controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mutational screening of exon 8 (containing all so-far reported point mutations) disclosed 5 novel and 2 previously described missense mutations. Microsatellite genotyping and sequencing revealed the presence of the 21-bp deletion (located in exon 12) in 5 cases and in none of the controls. Functional studies on mutant proteins showed no alteration, neither in the transactivating properties (all mutants) nor in the nuclear localization (21-bp deletion). Furthermore, an association analysis performed using 3 microsatellites at the MEF2A locus showed no significant association with MI. These results were confirmed in a replication study performed on an independent Italian population with coronary artery disease. CONCLUSIONS: All together, our data do not support MEF2A as a susceptibility gene for coronary artery disease/MI in the Italian population.

20132244|t|Novel and recurrent p14 mutations in Italian familial melanoma.
20132244|a|CDKN2A and CDK4 are the only known high-penetrant genes conferring proneness to cutaneous melanoma. The CDKN2A locus consists of four exons and encodes several alternate transcripts, two of which are p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), and originate from different open reading frames. Exon 1alpha is specific for p16(INK4a), while exon 1beta characterizes p14(ARF). Most CDKN2A mutations are located in exons 1alpha and 2, while exon 1beta variations have been identified in rare melanoma-prone pedigrees. In a previous study, we investigated 155 Italian melanoma cases, including 94 familial melanomas (FAMs) and 61 sporadic multiple primary melanomas (MPMs), for p16(INK4a)/CDK4 germline alterations and identified 15 p16(INK4a) and 1 CDK4 point mutations. In the present work, we extended our search to p14(ARF) mutations and CDKN2A deletions in the remaining samples. We identified the recurrent g.193+1G> A mutation in two FAM cases, while an additional pedigree displayed the previously undescribed variant g.161G> A. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) screening for copy variations resulted negative in all cases. In Italy, the overall frequency of p14(ARF) mutations is 3.2% in FAM and 0% in sporadic MPM. Re-evaluation of our patients' cohort emphasizes that the chance of identifying CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations in FAM is mainly influenced by the number of affected family members and the presence of one or more MPM cases. Accordingly, mutation rate rises to 61% in selected cases. Further studies are expected in order to investigate CDKN2A rarer mutations, including atypical deletions and inherited epimutations.

20186809|t|Intellectual disability, midface hypoplasia, facial hypotonia, and Alport syndrome are associated with a deletion in Xq22.3.
20186809|a|Alport syndrome with intellectual disability (ID) is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving several genes on Xq22.3 including COL4A5 and ACSL4. We report on a family with two males with this disorder and a Xq22.3 deletion. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and genomic analyses mapped the deletion region to between exon 1 of COL4A5 and exon 12 of ACSL4. The patients' mother has microscopic hematuria and was found to be heterozygous for the Xq22.3 deletion. Analysis using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of lymphoblastoid cell line RNA from an affected male in the family revealed a stable chimeric transcript with the ACSL4 exons 13-17 replaced by a cryptic exon from intron 1 of the COL4A5 gene. A truncated 54 kDa protein was predicted from this transcript but Western blot analysis and ACSL4 enzyme assay both showed functional nullisomy of ACSL4. We also compared the clinical features of the family with three previously reported families with the ACSL4 gene deletion and found that ID with absent or severely delayed speech, midface hypoplasia, and facial hypotonia are consistent features observed in the absence of ACSL4 gene.

20195899|t|Potential liability of reproductive endocrinologists for high order multiple gestation.
20195899|a|BACKGROUND: In light of the recent octuplet birth and the accompanying intensive media coverage, there has been much attention on high order multiple births resulting from assisted reproductive technology. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this commentary is to review 1) the relative contribution of ART to high order multiple gestation and its impact on infant morbidity, mortality, and health care dollar loss; 2) American Society of Reproductive Medicine's guidelines for the number of embryos transferred in ART; and 3) how reproductive endocrinologists can lessen their exposure to litigation by following the ASRM guidelines for the number of embryos transferred and documenting proper informed consent in the medical records. RECOMMENDATIONS: In situations in which the number of embryos transferred is in excess of the ASRM guidelines, justification for deviating from the ASRM guidelines should be justifiable and documented in the medical records.

20401977|t|The human AHR: identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms from six ethnic populations.
20401977|a|BACKGROUND: The effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related dioxin-like chemicals are mediated through binding-dependent activation of the cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The human AHR is a low-affinity receptor relative to most rodents, but some reports suggest that there may be individuals with polymorphic high-affinity receptors, thereby possibly increasing the sensitivity to dioxins in such people. METHODS: Although no polymorphisms have been reported in the ligand binding region of the AHR in the over 100 reported sequences, we sequenced 108 additional human AHR genes in an effort to further identify single single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the open reading frames of the AHR locus. The DNA was sequenced from six ethnic populations that included Japanese, Chinese, European/Caucasian, African-American, South East Asian, and Hispanic. RESULTS: Six exonic SNPs were identified; four had been described as previously reported and two seem to be novel. Four of the SNPs identified lead to amino acid changes in the AHR protein and two of the SNPs lead to synonymous substitutions. An additional four SNPs have been reported elsewhere that were not identified in the current analysis. With these new sequences, more than 200 human AHR gene sequences have been analyzed for SNPs. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a very limited presence of polymorphisms in the core ligand binding region of the human AHR. Other regions, such as the transactivation domain, seem to be slightly more polymorphic in the human population and the impact on functionality should be further examined.

20415560|t|Vitamin E reduces cardiovascular disease in individuals with diabetes mellitus and the haptoglobin 2-2 genotype.
20415560|a|AIMS: Individuals with both diabetes mellitus (DM) and the Haptoglobin (Hp) 2-2 genotype are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. As the antioxidant function of the Hp 2-2 protein is impaired, we sought to test the pharmacogenomic hypothesis that antioxidant vitamin E supplementation would provide cardiovascular protection to Hp 2-2 DM individuals. MATERIALS & METHODS: We determined the Hp genotype on DM participants from two trials (HOPE and ICARE) and assessed the effect of vitamin E by Hp genotype on their common prespecified outcome, the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. Data was analyzed with a fixed-effect model. These results were input into a simulation model, the Evidence Based Medicine Integrator, in order to estimate their long-term implications in a real-world population from Kaiser Permanente (CA, USA). RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the two trials demonstrated a significant overall reduction in the composite end point in Hp 2-2 DM individuals with vitamin E (odds ratio: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.40-0.86; p = 0.006). There was a statistically significant interaction between the Hp genotype and vitamin E on the composite end point. In these trials, Hp typing of 69 DM individuals and treating those with the Hp 2-2 with vitamin E prevented one myocardial infarct, stroke or cardiovascular death. Lifelong administration of vitamin E to Hp 2-2 DM individuals in the Kaiser population would increase their life expectancy by 3 years. CONCLUSION: A pharmacogenomic strategy of screening DM individuals for the Hp genotype and treating those with Hp 2-2 with vitamin E appears to be highly clinically effective.

20428796|t|Effect of the abrogation of TGF-beta1 by antisense oligonucleotides on the expression of TGF-beta-isoforms and their receptors I and II in isolated fibroblasts from keloid scars.
20428796|a|Disequilibrium of dermal wound repair can result in continued accumulation of ECM and excessive scar formation. In susceptible genetically predisposed individuals, keloid formation can be observed. Keloid disease represents a benign dermal fibroproliferative tumor that is unique to humans. TGF-beta is known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease which is still not fully understood. The isoforms TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 have profibrotic properties, whereas TGF-beta3 may have antifibrotic functions. TGF-beta exerts its influence by binding to type I and type II TGF-beta receptors, thereby forming a complex and activating specific downstream effector molecules. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TGF-beta1 targeting by antisense oligonucleotides on the RNA synthesis and protein expression of TGF-beta isoforms and their receptors in keloid-derived fibroblasts. In tissue samples with normal fibroblasts (NFs) serving as control samples, expression of TGF-beta1 and -beta2 was decreased when compared to keloid fibroblasts (KFs), while expression of TGF-beta3 and of TGF-betaRII was significantly higher in NFs. In the ELISA assay, abrogation of TGF-beta1 led to a significant decrease in TGF-beta1 and -beta2 (p<0.05). Expression of TGF-beta2 mRNA was reduced. Expression of TGF-beta3 mRNA revealed contrary patterns in KFs from different patients while expression of TGF-betaRI was found to be equal during the measurement period. TGF-betaRII mRNA expression was increased after 48 and 72 h respectively. There is growing evidence for a regulatory mechanism between TGF-beta1 and its receptors. Our findings support this theory by suggesting interrelations between the different TGF-beta isoforms and their receptors. Abnormal response of KFs to TGF-betamight reflect a modification in the regulatory pathway that occurs at the receptor level or during intracellular trans-duction. Improving the understanding of TGF-beta in keloid disease could lead to the development of clinically useful therapeutic modalities for treatment of keloid disease or even allow identification of preventive strategies.

20513137|t|NF1 microdeletions in neurofibromatosis type 1: from genotype to phenotype.
20513137|a|In 5-10% of patients, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) results from microdeletions that encompass the entire NF1 gene and a variable number of flanking genes. Two recurrent microdeletion types are found in most cases, with microdeletion breakpoints located in paralogous regions flanking NF1 (proximal NF1-REP-a and distal NF1-REP-c for the 1.4 Mb type-1 microdeletion, and SUZ12 and SUZ12P for the 1.2 Mb type-2 microdeletion). A more severe phenotype is usually associated with NF1 microdeletion patients than in those with intragenic mutations. We characterized NF1 microdeletions in 70 unrelated NF1 microdeleted patients using a high-resolution NF1 custom array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Genotype-phenotype correlations were studied in 58 of these microdeletion patients and compared to 389 patients with intragenic truncating NF1 mutations and phenotyped in the same standardized way. Our results confirmed in an unbiased manner the existence of a contiguous gene syndrome with a significantly higher incidence of learning disabilities and facial dysmorphism in microdeleted patients compared to patients with intragenic NF1 mutations. Microdeleted NF1 patients also showed a trend toward significance for childhood overgrowth. High-resolution array-CGH identified a new recurrent approximately 1.0 Mb microdeletion type, designated as type-3, with breakpoints in the paralogous regions middle NF1-REP-b and distal NF1-REP-c.

20540798|t|Sex-differential genetic effect of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) on carotid atherosclerosis.
20540798|a|BACKGROUND: The phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene was reported as a susceptibility gene to stroke. The genetic effect might be attributed to its role in modulating the atherogenic process in the carotid arteries. Using carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque index as phenotypes, the present study sought to determine the influence of this gene on subclinical atherosclerosis. METHODS: Carotid ultrasonography was performed on 1013 stroke-free subjects who participated in the health screening programs (age 52.6 +/- 12.2; 47.6% men). Genotype distribution was compared among the high-risk (plaque index > or = 4), low-risk (index = 1-3), and reference (index = 0) groups. We analyzed continuous IMT data and further dichotomized IMT data using mean plus one standard deviation as the cutoff level. Because the plaque prevalence and IMT values displayed a notable difference between men and women, we carried out sex-specific analyses in addition to analyzing the overall data. Rs702553 at the PDE4D gene was selected because it conferred a risk for young stroke in our previous report. Previous young stroke data (190 cases and 211 controls) with an additional 532 control subjects without ultrasonic data were shown as a cross-validation for the genetic effect. RESULTS: In the overall analyses, the rare homozygote of rs702553 led to an OR of 3.1 (p = 0.034) for a plaque index > or = 4. When subjects were stratified by sex, the genetic effect was only evident in men but not in women. Comparing male subjects with plaque index > or = 4 and those with plaque index = 0, the TT genotype was over-represented (27.6% vs. 13.4%, p = 0.008). For dichotomized IMT data in men, the TT genotype had an OR of 2.1 (p = 0.032) for a thicker IMT at the common carotid artery compared with the (AA + AT) genotypes. In women, neither IMT nor plaque index was associated with rs702553. Similarly, SNP rs702553 was only significant in young stroke men (OR = 1.8, p = 0.025) but not in women (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates a sex-differential effect of PDE4D on IMT, plaque index and stroke, which highlights its influence on various aspects of atherogenesis.

20596603|t|Identification of lipid droplet-associated proteins in the formation of macrophage-derived foam cells using microarrays.
20596603|a|A large number of macrophage-derived foam cells stores excessive neutral lipids in intracellular droplets, and plays a major role during the development of atherosclerosis. The formation and catabolism of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) are regulated by LD-associated proteins, a group of proteins which are located on the surface of LDs and regulate the formation, morphology and lipolysis of LDs. In order to illustrate the function of LD-associated proteins during the process of atherosclerosis, the foam cell model is induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) in macrophages originated from the THP-1 cell line, and cDNA microarrays are used to monitor the gene expression profiles of LD-associated proteins. Gene expression data show that 2% of changed genes are lipid binding genes during the transformation of foam cells. The major candidate genes, the cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector (CIDE) family and Perilipin, Adipophilin, and TIP47 (PAT) family, have different alterations during the formation of foam cells. CIDEB, CIDEC, Adipophilin, S3-12 and LSDP5 were up-regulated, while TIP47 was down-regulated. There was no significant change in CIDEA and Perilipin. These results were confirmed by real-time PCR and immunoblotting. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the gene expression of LD-associated proteins during the differentiation of human foam cells, which may play an important role in the process of atherosclerosis.

20663204|t|Genomic characterization of large rearrangements of the LDLR gene in Czech patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.
20663204|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in the LDLR gene are the most frequent cause of Familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal dominant disease characterised by elevated concentrations of LDL in blood plasma. In many populations, large genomic rearrangements account for approximately 10% of mutations in the LDLR gene. METHODS: DNA diagnostics of large genomic rearrangements was based on Multiple Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). Subsequent analyses of deletion and duplication breakpoints were performed using long-range PCR, PCR, and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: In set of 1441 unrelated FH patients, large genomic rearrangements were found in 37 probands. Eight different types of rearrangements were detected, from them 6 types were novel, not described so far. In all rearrangements, we characterized their exact extent and breakpoint sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Sequence analysis of deletion and duplication breakpoints indicates that intrachromatid non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between Alu elements is involved in 6 events, while a non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is implicated in 2 rearrangements. Our study thus describes for the first time NHEJ as a mechanism involved in genomic rearrangements in the LDLR gene.

20691404|t|Loss of corneodesmosin leads to severe skin barrier defect, pruritus, and atopy: unraveling the peeling skin disease.
20691404|a|Generalized peeling skin disease is an autosomal-recessive ichthyosiform erythroderma characterized by lifelong patchy peeling of the skin. After genome-wide linkage analysis, we have identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in CDSN in a large consanguineous family with generalized peeling skin, pruritus, and food allergies, which leads to a complete loss of corneodesmosin. In contrast to hypotrichosis simplex, which can be associated with specific dominant CDSN mutations, peeling skin disease is characterized by a complete loss of CDSN expression. The skin phenotype is consistent with a recent murine Cdsn knockout model. Using three-dimensional human skin models, we demonstrate that lack of corneodesmosin causes an epidermal barrier defect supposed to account for the predisposition to atopic diseases, and we confirm the role of corneodesmosin as a decisive epidermal adhesion molecule. Therefore, peeling skin disease will represent a new model disorder for atopic diseases, similarly to Netherton syndrome and ichthyosis vulgaris in the recent past.
