40725231010|a|At the whole animal levels (D), the EGFP-LC3 signal is relatively higher throughout in the spns1 mutant than in wild type, and a particularly strong signal can be seen in the liver, as shown in (A). In the head and trunk portions of the animals (D), a distinctive increase in the intensity of LysoTracker can be observed in the spns1 mutant. At the intracellular level (E), several small LC3 spots and largely diffuse green signal in the cells and cytosolic LysoTracker staining is seen. A number of enlarged LC3- and LysoTracker-positive yellow punctate structures can be seen in the spns1 mutant by confocal microscopy at a higher magnification (inset; enlarged from dotted square area). (F) EGFP-LC3 and mCherry-LC3 double-transgenic [Tg(EGFP-LC3:mCherry-LC3)] zebrafish were used to monitor autolysosome formation in spns1 MO-injected embryos at 84 hpf. A number of enlarged yellow LC3 puncta were detected in the spns1 morphant, while only small yellow LC3 spots can be seen in control-injected embryos. Nuclei were counterstained with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI). Scale bar, 250 um in (D). Scale bar, 10 um in (E, F).

48187531003|t|  A Concentrations of endogenous insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I in the different fractions obtained by neutral chromatography on a Superdex 200 column.
48187531003|a|Serum samples from the four siblings of family 1 were analyzed and compared to a non-related prepubertal control, as all siblings were prepubertal. The amount of IGF-I detected in the fractions corresponding to the ternary complex (TC) was markedly greater in the homozygous affected subjects (II 1 and II 3) compared to the unaffected siblings (II.2 and II.4) and the prepubertal control. No IGF-I was detected in the fractions corresponding to the binary complex (BC) or free IGF-I in any of the subjects. This is most likely due to the fact that under physiological conditions 80-85% of IGF-I circulates in the TC and after the separation procedure, the amount of IGF-I in the BC or free was below the level of detection of our IGF-I assay. These results clearly demonstrate that in the affected patients the amount of IGF-I circulating in the TC is markedly elevated.

Bars for Sas-6 and STIL are marked in red to indicate that the corresponding values should be approximately doubled to correct for the fact that some 50% of purified centrosomes are derived from G1 phase cells that mostly lack these two proteins. Note the different scale for  -tubulin on the y-axis.

40725231003|t|(A) Schematic representation of the zebrafishbeclin 1 (zbeclin 1) gene, its mRNA and protein products.
40725231003|a|A splice-blocking beclin 1 MO was designed to overlap the intron-exon boundary at the 5'-splice junction of exon 4 in the zebrafishbeclin 1 gene. To detect aberrantly spliced RNA products, two forward primers were designed for exon 3 (EX3 primer) and exon 4 (EX4 primer), and one reverse primer was designed for exon 7 (EX7 primer) within the beclin 1 gene. The zebrafishbeclin 1 gene has a total of 11 exons having three unique domains [BH3 domain, coiled-coil (CCD) domain, and evolutionarily conserved (ECD) domain], and the beclin 1 MO was anticipated to disrupt the BH3 domain encoded by exon 4 and exon 5. (B) Splicing detection of zbeclin 1 mRNA by RT-PCR. Amplified PCR fragments show the intact sizes of the two amplicons for EX3-EX7 and EX4-EX7 following control (water) injection or only spns1 MO injection. Either beclin 1 MO (12 ng/embryo) injection or coinjection of spns1 MO (4 ng/embryo) and beclin 1 MO (12 ng/embryo) generated a skipping of exon 4 (beclin 1Dexon4). This was detected by the presence of an altered EX3-EX7 amplicon and undetectable EX4-EX7 product. The deletion of exon 4 was confirmed by sequencing. Injected embryos were harvested for total RNA isolation at 54 hpf.

Primer-extension pauses/stops correspond to   sites (indicated on the left and right). Note: The above-background signal of  42 in the snr81D lane (and to some extent, in the snr81D pus7D lane) is likely caused by the presence of strong  44 band. This is a primer-extension artifact, which often occurs when there is a strong   signal in the neighboring position. Alternatively, it is possible that having   at position 44 allows for an unidentified enzyme other than snR81 to modify U42 (albeit inefficiently) (Perhaps Pus1, which is responsible for  44 formation, can be a bit "processive"). Lanes 1-8 and lanes 9-16 are from two separate gels.

42914791013|a|Secretagogin (arrowheads) was localized to membranous organelles in the perikarya (A), particularly the plasmalemma (A1) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in neuronal soma (s; A2). Open rectangles in (A) denote the location of insets. Semi transparent shading is used to visually dissociate subcellular compartments in (A-C). B Pre embedding secretagogin labeling (arrowheads) was also seen in dendrite (d) segments. C In axo dendritic terminals (ax), secretagogin was closely associated with synaptic vesicles along the plasmalemma (arrowheads). D Quantitative analysis of subcellular secretagogin distribution upon electron microscopy detection of silver enhanced gold particles. Particles were considered as membrane bound when they were at 50 nm of a membrane (plasma membrane or endomembrane; i.e., secretory vesicle, Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum). In the soma of PVNneurons, significantly more particles were found in the cytosol as along the plasma membrane (**P 0.01). In contrast, membrane association predominated in axonal nerve endings in the median eminence (*P 0.05). Note that a significant proportion of particles was found adjacent to endomembranes in all subcellular compartments studied.

38180751004|a|All loops are shown in approximately the same orientation, with entering and exiting helices ghosted for clarity. Residues of note are coloured in orange. cEF1 is shown in its apo state. cEF2 is shown in its apo, Ca2+ bound and Mg2+ bound states. In the cEF2 apo state, E354 is stabilized by nearby loop residue R344. In the Ca2+ bound state, cEF2 loop residues coordinate Ca2+ in a pentagonal, bipyramidal arrangement, with E354 as a bidentate ligand. An ordered water molecule at the apex of one of the pyramids is represented as a small red sphere. In the Mg2+ bound state, the coordination is octahedral with E354 as a monodentate ligand. The hEF1 and hEF2 loops adopt a conformation quite different from the cEF hands, and also lack the acidic residues that typically coordinate cations. Note the conserved hEF1 272VTL274 and hEF2 386VTL388 residues, which overlay identically in Fig 2A. cEF, canonical EF hand; hEF, hidden EF hand.

30492151005|a|UAS-EGFP is used as a negative control. Either Ft or Wts overexpression strongly suppresses loss of PR caused by Atro75QN. Lower panels are provided as examples of quantification. A more modest but still significant rescue is observed by overexpressing a Yki RNAi contruct or Hpo; however, in this case it is to be considered that the overexpression of Hpoper se brings about the loss of at least one PR in  5% of ommatidia (data not shown). No effect is detected with overexpression of Sav. Two tailed t test: *P0.05; **P0.01. The wtsEPG4808 is a previously uncharacterised EP element insertion at the 5' of the wts gene. Rare homozygous escapers display larger eyes, whereas in combination with GMR-GMR this line gives rise to smaller rough eyes, and, finally, GMR analysis of GMR>wtsEPG4808 indicates a 10 fold increase in the head content of wts mRNA (data not shown).

47184591019|a|The in vitro synthesized radioactive Bax proteins, each with a single cysteine positioned in helix a2, a3, a4 or a5, were activated and targeted to the mitochondria. The resulting mitochondria were isolated and treated with IASD in the absence or presence of CHAPS, urea, or both. After 30 min, the labeling reactions were stopped by mercaptoethanol. For the "0 min" controls, the samples were pretreated with mercaptoethanol before addition of IASD. The IASD-labeled radioactive Bax proteins were resolved from the unlabeled ones using either isoelectric focusing (IEF; as indicated) or gradient SDS-PAGE and detected by phosphor-imaging. Triangles and arrows indicate the unlabeled and IASD-labeled Bax proteins, respectively. n = 3 for V111C, and K119C; 4 for W107C, and A117C; 2 for other mutants. C-D. The phosphor-imaging data for IASD labeling of Bax mutants in (B) and the similar data from the independent replicates were quantified to derive the membrane or protein burial indices as described and shown in Appendix Figure S3. The membrane burial indices were normalized by that of G179C in a9, a reference for the membrane-buried residues. The resulting relative membrane burial indices are shown in (C). The residues with the relative membrane burial index > 40% of that of Gly179 are considered as buried in the MOM. Similarly, the relative protein burial indices shown in (D) were obtained by using Y115C in a5 as a reference for the protein-buried residues. The residues with the relative protein burial index > 40% of that of Tyr115 are considered as buried in the protein or its complex.
