23220749|t|Apomorphine is a bimodal modulator of TRPA1 channels.
23220749|a|Apomorphine is a non-narcotic derivative of morphine, which acts as a dopamine agonist and is clinically used to treat "off-states" in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Adverse effects of apomorphine treatment include severe emesis and nausea, and ulceration and pain at the injection site. We wanted to test whether sensory transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a molecular target for apomorphine. Here, we show that rTRPV1, rTRPV2, rTRPV3, and mTRPV4, as well as hTRPM8, and rTRPM3, which are expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons, are insensitive toward apomorphine treatment. This also applied to the cellular redox sensor hTRPM2. On the contrary, human TRPA1 could be concentration-dependently modulated by apomorphine. Whereas the addition of apomorphine in the low micromolar range produced an irreversible activation of the channel, application of higher concentrations caused a reversible voltage-dependent inhibition of heterologously expressed TRPA1 channels, resulting from a reduction of single-channel open times. In addition, we provide evidence that apomorphine also acts on endogenous TRPA1 in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons from rats and in the enterochromaffin model cell line QGP-1, from which serotonin is released upon activation of TRPA1. Our study shows that human TRPA1 is a target for apomorphine, suggesting that an activation of TRPA1 might contribute to adverse side effects such as nausea and painful injections, which can occur during treatment with apomorphine.

8142113|t|Adapalene, a new chemical entity with retinoid activity.
8142113|a|Adapalene is a novel chemical entity which, in terms of pharmacology, behaves similar to tretinoin, but is chemically and photochemically stable. It has a particular selectivity profile for the known nuclear retinoic acid receptors with low affinity for RAR alpha and no transactivating potential for RXR alpha. This receptor profile could imply that adapalene, in contrast to tretinoin, affects the terminal differentiation pathway of epidermal cells rather than their proliferation. Furthermore, adapalene does not bind to members of the cellular retinoic acid binding protein family. Adapalene has comedolytic activity in the topical rhino mouse model. It exerts a moderate-to-potent anti-inflammatory effect in a series of in vitro and in vivo models. In comparative clinical studies involving 72 acne patients, the efficacy of adapalene was comparable, if not superior, to tretinoin, but adapalene was better tolerated. The data reviewed in this paper indicate that adapalene should be particularly beneficial in the treatment of acne.

14523001|t|Transcriptional control of the arginine/lysine transporter, cat-1, by physiological stress.
14523001|a|Cells respond to physiological stress by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2. This adaptive response inhibits protein synthesis and up-regulates genes essential for cell survival. Cat-1, the transporter for the essential amino acids, arginine and lysine, is one of the up-regulated genes. We previously showed that stress increases cat-1 expression by coordinated stabilization of the mRNA and increased mRNA translation. This induction is triggered by amino acid depletion and the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is caused by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. We show here that cat-1 gene transcription is also increased by cellular stress. Our studies demonstrate that the cat-1 gene promoter/regulatory region is TATA-less and is located in a region that includes 94 bases of the first exon. Transcription from this promoter is stimulated 8-fold by cellular stress. An amino acid response element within the first exon is shown to be required for the response to amino acid depletion but not to the UPR. The stimulation of transcription by amino acid depletion requires activation of GCN2 kinase, which phosphorylates eIF2alpha. This phosphorylation also induces translation of the cat-1 mRNA, demonstrating that stress-induced transcriptional and translational control of cat-1 are downstream targets of a signaling pathway initiating with eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Our studies show that the increase in cat-1 gene expression by cellular stress involves at least three types of coordinate regulation: regulation of transcription, regulation of mRNA stability, and regulation of mRNA translation.

20226815|t|Autoradiographic study of serotonin transporter during memory formation.
20226815|a|Serotonin transporter (SERT) has been associated with drugs of abuse like d-methamphetamine (METH). METH is well known to produce effects on the monoamine systems but it is unclear how METH affects SERT and memory. Here the effects of METH and the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) on autoshaping and novel object recognition (NOR) were investigated. Notably, both memory tasks recruit different behavioral, neural and cognitive demand. In autoshaping task a dose-response curve for METH was determined. METH (1.0mg/kg) impaired short-term memory (STM; lasting less of 90min) in NOR and impaired both STM and long-term memory (LTM; lasting 24 and 48h) in autoshaping, indicating that METH had long-lasting effects in the latter task. A comparative autoradiography study of the relationship between the binding pattern of SERT in autoshaping new untrained vs. trained treated (METH, FLX, or both) animals was made. Considering that hemispheric dominance is important for LTM, hence right vs. left hemisphere of the brain was compared. Results showed that trained animals decreased cortical SERT binding relative to untrained ones. In untrained and trained treated animals with the amnesic dose (1.0mg/kg) of METH SERT binding in several areas including hippocampus and cortex decreased, more remarkably in the trained animals. In contrast, FLX improved memory, increased SERT binding, prevented the METH amnesic effect and re-established the SERT binding. In general, memory and amnesia seemed to make SERT more vulnerable to drugs effects.

12383039|t|The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux sodium in healthy volunteers.
12383039|a|OBJECTIVE: Fondaparinux sodium is the first in a new class of synthetic factor Xa inhibitors that binds reversibly with high affinity to antithrombin III. It has been investigated for the prevention and treatment of arterial and venous thrombotic disorders and approved for use at a dose of 2.5mg once daily in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in major orthopaedic surgery. The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux sodium were determined in eight studies in young and elderly healthy volunteers. RESULTS: After a 2.5mg subcutaneous dose to young volunteers, absolute bioavailability was 100% and absorption was rapid and complete [peak plasma concentration (C(max)) 0.34 mg/L occurred at approximately 2 hours]. Within- and total-subject variability estimates were small: 5.5 and 11.6%, respectively, for C(max )and 4.4 and 17.5% for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Steady state was obtained after the third or fourth once-daily dose, with a 1.3-fold increase in C(max) and AUC. Distribution volume (7 to 11L) was limited to blood volume. There was no evidence of metabolism. Fondaparinux sodium was almost completely excreted in urine as unchanged compound (64 to 77% of the dose was recovered at 72 hours after administration). Plasma clearance was 5.1 to 7.9 ml/min, renal clearance 4.0 to 7.9 ml/min, and the terminal half-life was 17 hours in young volunteers and 21 hours in elderly volunteers. Pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux sodium were linear in the range 2 to 8mg subcutaneously and 2 to 20mg intravenously. Pharmacokinetics observed in healthy elderly volunteers were consistent with findings in young male volunteers. CONCLUSION: The favourable pharmacokinetic profile of fondaparinux sodium is likely to play an important role in the major advance that the drug represents in the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders.

22566187|t|Evaluation of food-drug interaction of guava leaf tea.
22566187|a|Guava leaf tea (GLT) contains guava leaf polyphenol (Gvpp), which regulates the absorption of dietary carbohydrate from the intestines. Borderline diabetics, who are at high risk of development of diabetes, take GLT to suppress a rapid increase of blood sugar level after meals. However, patients with diabetes in whom diabetic drugs or warfarin as a blood thinner are prescribed also take GLT with the expectation of glycemic control. Therefore, we studied whether GLT had potential for inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and an influence on the action of warfarin. Extract of guava leaf (GvEx) consists of carbohydrate and polyphenols, which are Gvpp, quercetin, and ellagic acid. These polyphenols, but not GvEx, showed a certain level of inhibition of human-cDNA-expressed CYPs. In a comparison of GLT and grapefruit juice, GLT showed weaker inhibition of CYP activities and of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation than grapefruit juice. Furthermore, neither liver weight nor CYP3A expression in the liver was changed in rats that received GvEx for 90 days compared with the control group. When rats were concomitantly treated with GLT and warfarin, the prolongation of clotting time of blood by warfarin was not influenced. These data suggest that GLT is unlikely to interact with drugs.

23098818|t|The catalytic competence of cytochrome P450 in the synthesis of serotonin from 5-methoxytryptamine in the brain: an in vitro study.
23098818|a|Brain serotonin has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders, as well as in the mechanism of action of psychotropic drugs. The aim of present study was to identify rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms which can catalyze the O-demethylation of 5-methoxytryptamine to serotonin, and to find out whether that alternative pathway of serotonin synthesis may take place in the brain. The study was conducted on cDNA-expressed CYPs (rat CYP1A1/2, 2A1/2, 2B1, 2C6/11/13, 2D1/2/4/18, 2E1, 3A2 and human CYP2D6), on rat brain and liver microsomes and on human liver microsomes (the wild-type CYP2D6 or the allelic variant 2D6*4*4). Of the rat CYP isoforms studied, CYP2D isoforms were the most efficient in catalyzing the O-demethylation of 5-methoxytryptamine to serotonin, but they were less effective than the human isoform CYP2D6. Microsomes from different brain regions were capable of metabolizing 5-methoxytryptamine to serotonin. The reaction was inhibited by the specific CYP2D inhibitors quinine and fluoxetine. Human liver microsomes of the wild-type CYP2D6 metabolized 5-methoxytryptamine to serotonin more effectively than did the defective CYP2D6*4*4 ones. The obtained results indicate that rat brain CYP2D isoforms catalyze the formation of serotonin from 5-methoxytryptamine, and that the deficit or genetic defect of CYP2D may affect serotonin metabolism in the brain. The results are discussed in the context of their possible physiological and pharmacological significance in vivo.

15353299|t|Thymidylate synthase: a critical target in cancer therapy?
15353299|a|For the last four decades, synthesis and testing of potentially active drugs (e.g., antimetabolites) have focused on structural modification of existing metabolites as precursors of DNA and RNA synthesis. In recent years, the focus has shifted to synthesis of target-specific agents. Thus, the current emphasis of drug development is directed at inhibiting specific target(s) expressed preferentially, if not exclusively, in tumor tissues, with the ultimate goal of improving the therapeutic efficacy and selectivity of these new agents. Preclinically, proof-of-principle studies were carried out in tumors with specific expression of the intended target. With the hope of translating preclinical findings to the design of implementation of clinical trials. Thymidylate synthase (TS) continues to be a critical target for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and its prodrugs, UFT/LV (Orzel), capecitabine (Xeloda), and S-1, primarily because this enzyme is essential for the synthesis of 2-deoxythymidine-5-monophosphate, a precursor for DNA synthesis. While fluoropyrimidine antimetabolites have other sites of action, antifolates ZD1694 (raltitrexed, Tomudex) and AG337 (Thymitag) are more specific and potent TS inhibitors. Thus, it is hoped that pronounced and sustained inhibition of this enzyme could result in downstream regulation of molecular markers associated with sensitivity and resistance to these agents. It is also critical to recognize that the degree and duration of inhibition of the target enzyme may depend on the expression level of the target enzyme, thymidylate synthase. Correlative studies in preclinical and clinical systems demonstrated a close relationship between the enzyme level (mRNA and protein) and response to therapy of colorectal cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidine or Tomudex. However, significant overlap was demonstrated between responders and non-responders. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that prediction of response to anticancer drugs is multifactorial, and TS is one target. Clinically, although overall response of colorectal cancer patients to a variety of TS inhibitors is similar, toxicity profiles are different. The availability of the 5-FU prodrugs offers the possibility of greater therapeutic selectivity based on the demonstration that thymidine phosphorylase, the activating enzyme for 5-FU, is expressed at a higher level in tumor tissue compared with normal tissue counterparts. It is likely that successful application of TS inhibitors will not only be based on measurement of the TS level in tumors vs. normal tissues, but on the delineation of the consequences of this inhibition on molecular markers associated with cellular proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation.

23477419|t|Design, Synthesis, and Pharmacological Characterization of Novel Endomorphin-1 Analogues as Extremely Potent u-Opioid Agonists.
23477419|a|Recently we reported the synthesis and structure-activity study of endomorphin-1 (EM-1) analogues containing novel, unnatural a-methylene-b-aminopropanoic acids (Map). In the present study, we describe new EM-1 analogues containing Dmt(1), (R/S)-bPro(2), and (ph)Map(4)/(2-furyl)Map(4). All of the analogues showed a high affinity for the u-opioid receptor (MOR) and increased stability in mouse brain homogenates. Of the new compounds, Dmt(1)-(R)-bPro(2)-Trp(3)-(2-furyl)Map(4) (analogue 12) displayed the highest affinity toward MOR, in the picomolar range (Ki(u) = 3.72 pM). Forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation assays indicated that this analogue displayed an extremely high agonistic potency, in the subpicomolar range (EC50 = 0.0421 pM, Emax = 99.5%). This compound also displayed stronger in vivo antinociceptive activity after iv administration when compared to morphine in the tail-flick test, which indicates that this analogue was able to cross the blood-brain barrier.

23194511|t|Phenolic profiles and antioxidant activity of litchi pulp of different cultivars cultivated in Southern China.
23194511|a|The phenolic profiles and antioxidant activity of litchi pulp of 13 varieties were investigated. The free, bound and total phenolic contents were 66.17-226.03, 11.18-40.54, and 101.51-259.18 mg of gallic acid equivalents/100 g, respectively. The free, bound and total flavonoid contents were 16.68-110.33, 10.48-22.75, and 39.43-129.86 mg of catechin equivalents/100 g, respectively. Free phenolics and flavonoids contributed averagely 80.1% and 75% to their total contents, respectively. Six individual phenolics (gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, (+)-catechin, caffeic acid, (-)-epicatechin, and rutin) were detected in litchi pulp by HPLC. The contents of each compound in free and bound fractions were determined. Significant varietal discrepancy in antioxidant activity was also found by FRAP and DPPH scavenging capacity methods. Antioxidant activity was significantly correlated with phenolic and flavonoid contents. Thus, phenolics and flavonoids exist mainly in the free form in litchi pulp. There were significant varietal differences in phytochemical contents and antioxidant activity of litchi pulp.

1435788|t|Prohormone convertase-1 will process prorelaxin, a member of the insulin family of hormones.
1435788|a|Relaxin is a polypeptide hormone involved in remodeling of the birth canal during parturition. It is synthesized as a preprohormone precursor, which undergoes specific processing to form the mature two-chain disulfide-linked active species that is secreted by the cell. A major part of this processing requires endoproteolytic cleavage at specific pairs of basic amino acid residues, an event necessary for the maturation of a variety of important biologically active proteins, such as insulin and nerve growth factor. Human type 2 preprorelaxin was coexpressed in human kidney 293 cells with the candidate prohormone convertase-processing enzymes mPC1 or mPC2, both cloned from the mouse pituitary tumor AtT-20 cell line, or with the yeast kex2 alpha-mating factor-converting enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Prorelaxin expressed alone in 293 cells was secreted into the culture medium unprocessed. Transient coexpression with mPC1 or kex2, but not with mPC2, resulted in the secretion of a low mol wt species with an electrophoretic mobility very similar, if not identical, to that of authentic mature relaxin purified from human placenta. This species was precipitable by monoclonal antibodies specific for relaxin and had a retention time on reverse phase HPLC comparable to that of relaxin. Its analysis by both electrospray and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry generated mass data that were consistent only with mature relaxin. The basic residues required for mPC1-dependent cleavage of prorelaxin are defined by site-directed mutagenesis.

10771044|t|Effect of JTH-601, a novel alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, on prostate function in dogs.
10771044|a|We examined the effect of JTH-601 (3- inverted question markN-[2-(4-hydroxy-2-isopropyl-5-methylphenoxy)ethyl]-N-methylaminom ethyl inverted question mark-4-methoxy-2,5,6-trimethylphenol hemifumarate), a new alpha(1L)-adrenoceptor antagonist, on prostatic function in isolated canine prostate and in anesthetized dogs. In the contraction study, phenylephrine and noradrenaline produced concentration-dependent contractions in canine prostate and carotid artery, respectively. In these tissues, JTH-601, prazosin (a non-selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist), and tamsulosin (an alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonist) competitively antagonized contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. The pA(2) (pK(B)) values with prostate were 8.49+/-0.07 for JTH-601, 7.94+/-0.04 for prazosin and 9.42+/-0.22 for tamsulosin. The ratio of pA(2) (carotid artery/prostate), i.e. prostatic selectivity, was 10.471 for JTH-601, 0.008 for prazosin and 0.371 for tamsulosin, respectively. In anesthetized dogs, JTH-601 (1 mg/kg, i.d.) significantly decreased urethral pressure by 15% without affecting blood pressure or heart rate. Tamsulosin (0.1 mg/kg, i.d.) decreased urethral pressure to the same extent as did JTH-601, but with a significant effect on blood pressure and heart rate. JTH-601 showed higher selectivity for canine prostate both in vitro and in vivo. In prostate, an important role of the alpha(1L)-adrenoceptor is suggested in the smooth muscle contraction mediated by alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. JTH-601 is expected to be an effective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist for the treatment of urinary outlet obstruction by benign prostatic hypertrophy with a minimum effect on the cardiovascular system.

7825862|t|Interactions of PGH synthase isozymes-1 and -2 with NSAIDs.
7825862|a|There are two isozymes of prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase (cyclooxygenase) called PGH synthase-1 and -2 or COX I and II. Both isozymes catalyze the same two reactions: oxygenation of arachidonate to yield PGG2 and reduction of PGG2 to PGH2. PGH synthase-1 is expressed constitutively and is found in most tissues. PGH synthase-2 is undetectable in most cells but can be induced in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, ovarian follicles, and macrophages by various mitogens, cytokines, and tumor promoters. PGH synthase-1 (PGHS-1) has been presumed to be the site of action of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, the discovery of the second isozyme, PGH synthase-2 (PGHS-2), and its association with inflammation has suggested that this latter enzyme may be the therapeutic target of NSAIDs functioning in their antiinflammatory capacities. We have cloned cDNAs for murine PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, expressed these enzymes in cos-1 cells, and compared the relative sensitivities of the two isozymes to some common NSAIDs. Indomethacin, piroxicam, and sulindac sulfide were found to preferentially inhibit PGHS-1. Ibuprofen and meclofenamate inhibit both enzymes with comparable potencies. 6-Methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid, the active metabolite of Relafen, inhibits murine PGHS-2 preferentially. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits PGHS-1, preventing this isozyme from forming PGH2 or any other oxygenated product; in contrast, aspirin treatment of PGHS-2 causes this enzyme to form 15-hydroxy-5c,8c,11c,13t-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) instead of PGH2. Our results indicate mouse PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are pharmacologically distinct. Thus, it should be possible to develop agents highly selective for each PGHS isozyme. PGHS-2 is not expressed in stomach but is increased by inflammatory cytokines in cells such as macrophages. Thus, a selective inhibitor of PGHS-2 could be an antiinflammatory agent but without being ulcerogenic.

23529825|t|Lorcaserin: a review of its use in chronic weight management.
23529825|a|Oral lorcaserin (BELVIQ(R)), a selective serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonist, is indicated in the US as an adjunct to diet and exercise in the chronic weight management of obese adults, or overweight adults with at least one weight-related comorbidity (e.g. dyslipidaemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes). This article reviews the pharmacological properties, therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of oral lorcaserin in this patient population. In three large randomized, double-blind, multicentre studies, oral lorcaserin was more effective than placebo in the management of obese and overweight adults with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following 12 months' therapy, significantly higher proportions of lorcaserin than placebo recipients achieved a >5 and >10 % reduction from baseline in their bodyweight and a significant between-group difference favouring lorcaserin over placebo was observed for the change from baseline in bodyweight. Moreover, among patients who had achieved a >5 % reduction in their bodyweight after 12 months' therapy with lorcaserin, a significantly higher proportion who received lorcaserin for a further 12 months than those who switched to placebo maintained >5 % weight loss at 24 months. In general, oral lorcaserin was well tolerated in clinical studies, with hypoglycaemia and headache the most frequently reported adverse events in those with or without type 2 diabetes, respectively. According to a pooled analysis, the risk of US-FDA-defined valvulopathy with lorcaserin is generally low and not statistically significantly different from placebo. From these and other data, the FDA has concluded that lorcaserin is unlikely to elevate the risk of valvulopathy.

17692748|t|Central sympatholysis as a novel countermeasure for cocaine-induced sympathetic activation and vasoconstriction in humans.
17692748|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether cocaine's sympathomimetic actions can be reversed by a potent centrally acting alpha2 adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist (dexmedetomidine). BACKGROUND: We recently showed that cocaine stimulates the human cardiovascular system primarily by acting in the brain to increase sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), the neural stimulus to norepinephrine release. Thus, SNA constitutes a putative new drug target to block cocaine's adverse cardiovascular effects at their origin. METHODS: In 22 healthy cocaine-naive humans, we measured skin SNA (microneurography) and skin blood flow (laser Doppler velocimetry) as well as heart rate and blood pressure before and after intranasal cocaine (2 mg/kg) alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine or saline. RESULTS: During intranasal cocaine alone, SNA increased by 2-fold and skin vascular resistance increased from 13.2 +/- 2.3 to 20.1 +/- 2.2 resistance units while mean arterial pressure increased by 14 +/- 3 mm Hg and heart rate by 18 +/- 3 beats/min (p < 0.01). Dexmedetomidine abolished these increases, whereas intravenous saline was without effect. Dexmedetomidine was effective in blocking these sympathomimetic actions of cocaine even in all 7 subjects who were homozygous for the Del322-325 polymorphism in the alpha2C AR, a loss-of-function mutation that is highly enriched in blacks. CONCLUSIONS: The data advance the novel hypothesis that central sympatholysis with dexmedetomidine constitutes a highly effective countermeasure for cocaine's sympathomimetic actions on the human cardiovascular system, even in individuals carrying the alpha2CDel322-325 polymorphism.

20724158|t|Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and breast cancer risk.
20724158|a|BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiologic and laboratory studies have suggested that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce the risk of breast cancer through inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to measure the association between selective cox-2 inhibitors, particularly celecoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib and non-specific NSAID subgroups, and breast cancer risk. Between 2003 and 2006, a total of 18,368 incident breast cancer cases were identified in the Ingenix/Lab Rx insurance database, which contains clinical encounter and drug prescription data. Four controls per case were randomly selected, matched on age and time in database. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Breast cancer risk was inversely associated with both non-specific NSAID and selective COX-2 inhibitor use. Greater than 12 months' duration of use of Celecoxib at a standard dose (200mg/day) was associated with a 16% decrease in breast cancer risk (OR=0.84, 95% CI=0.73, 0.97). We observed the greatest risk reduction in association with >2 years of rofecoxib exposure (OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.37, 0.80). Acetaminophen, a compound with less biological plausibility for chemoprevention, showed no significant association with the risk of developing breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Consistent with animal models and laboratory investigations, higher doses of selective COX-2 inhibitors were more protective against breast cancer than non-specific NSAIDs. With exposure to rofecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, breast cancer risk reduction was appreciable (46%), suggesting a possible role for selective COX-2 inhibitors in breast cancer prophylaxis.

1978244|a|Using the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtype-selective antagonists chlorethylclonidine (CEC), WB4101, and 5-methyl-urapidil, we have examined the possible heterogeneity in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor populations in rabbit aorta. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor alkylating agent CEC selectively inhibited the phasic component of the norepinephrine-induced contractile response, with little effect on the tonic component. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor occupancy-response relationship defined by the phenoxybenzamine inactivation method was rectangular hyperbolic for the tonic response, whereas that for the phasic response was linear, indicating the different degree of receptor reserve for the two responses. Radioligand binding studies with the nonselective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist radioligand 125I-BE2254 showed that 73-87% of the binding sites in rabbit aorta are CEC sensitive and they are predominantly low affinity sites both for WB4101 (pKd = 8.1) and for 5-methylurapidil (pKd = 7.1). Moreover, alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis was CEC sensitive, and fractional inactivation of alpha 1 receptors with CEC showed equivalent increments in the reduction of PI hydrolysis and phasic contractile response, suggesting that both responses are linearly related to the CEC-sensitive receptor sites. The Schild plots for the competitive antagonists WB4101 and 5-methyl-urapidil against alpha 1a-adrenoceptor-selective agonist methoxamine-induced contraction were linear and had slopes not significantly different from unity, with a pA2 of 9.07 +/- 0.07 (n = 5) for WB4101 and 9.09 +/- 0.05 (n = 3) for 5-methyl-urapidil. However, the Schilod plots for these antagonists against norepinephrine were curvilinear. Computer-assisted analysis of these curvilinear Schild plots in a two-receptor system indicated that alpha 1-adrenoceptor populations responsible for the constrictive response are predominantly (approximately 80-90%) low affinity sites for the two antagonists (pKd approximately 8.1 for WB4101 and pKd approximately 7.1 for 5-methyl-urapidil) and a small population (approximately 10-20%) are high affinity sites (pKd approximately 9.1 for both WB4101 and 5-methyl-urapidil), which was in good agreement with radioligand binding studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

2982865|t|Multiple affinity states of opiate receptor in neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells. Opiate agonist association rate is a function of receptor occupancy.
2982865|a|The existence of multiple affinity states for the opiate receptor in neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells has been demonstrated by competition binding studies with tritiated diprenorphine and [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE). In the presence of 10 mM Mg2+, all receptors exist in a high affinity state with Kd = 1.88 +/- 0.16 nM. Addition of 10 microM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) decreased the affinity of DADLE to Kd = 8.08 +/- 0.93 nM. However, in the presence of 100 mM Na+, which is required for opiate inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, analysis of competition binding data revealed three sites: the first, consisting of 17.5% of total receptor population has a Kd = 0.38 +/- 0.18 nM; the second, 50.6% of the population, has a Kd = 6.8 +/- 2.2 nM; and the third, 31.9% of the population, has a Kd of 410 +/- 110 nM. Thus, in the presence of sodium, a high affinity complex between receptor (R), GTP binding component (Ni), and ligand (L) was formed which was different from that formed in the absence of sodium. These multiple affinity states of receptor in the hybrid cells are agonist-specific, and the percentage of total opiate receptor in high affinity state is relatively constant in various concentrations of Na+. Multiple affinity states of opiate receptor can be demonstrated further by Scatchard analysis of saturation binding studies with [3H]DADLE. In the presence of Mg2+, or Gpp(NH)p, analysis of [3H]DADLE binding demonstrates that opiate receptor can exist in a single affinity state, with apparent Kd values of [3H]DADLE in 10 mM Mg2+ = 1.75 +/- 0.28 nM and in 10 microM Gpp(NH)p = 0.85 +/- 0.12 nM. There is a reduction of Bmax value from 0.19 +/- 0.02 nM in the presence of Mg2+ to 0.14 +/- 0.03 nM in the presence of Gpp(NH)p. In the presence of 100 mM Na+, Scatchard analysis of saturation binding of [3H]DADLE reveals nonlinear plots; two-site analysis of the curves yields Kd = 0.43 +/- 0.09 and 7.9 +/- 3.2 nM. These Kd values are analogous to that obtained with competition binding studies. Again, this conversion of single site binding Scatchard plots to multiple sites binding plots in the presence of Na+ is restricted to 3H-agonist binding only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

12901032|t|Interaction of rofecoxib and celecoxib with warfarin.
12901032|a|The interaction of celecoxib and rofecoxib with warfarin was studied. Patients stable on warfarin therapy and concurrently taking a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor comparator (traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, salsalate, or acetaminophen) randomly received celecoxib 200 mg/day or rofecoxib 25 mg/day for three weeks. After a one-week washout period, the patients were crossed over to treatment with the opposite COX-2 inhibitor for three more weeks. The International Normalized Ratio (INR) was measured at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, and 3 of therapy with each COX-2 inhibitor by testing blood samples obtained by finger stick. Data for 16 patients were analyzed. The INR increased by 13%, 6%, and 5% on average in patients taking celecoxib at weeks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and by 5%, 9%, and 5% in patients taking rofecoxib. Changes in the INR were statistically significant at week 1 for celecoxib and at week 2 for rofecoxib. Of the 12 subjects who had a clinically significant > or = 15% change in the INR while receiving either COX-2 inhibitor, 4 showed this change for both agents. Adverse drug reactions were similar for each COX-2 inhibitor, but the rate of edema requiring medical intervention was higher in the rofecoxib group. Significant increases in the INR were observed in patients who were stable on warfarin therapy after the addition of therapy with rofecoxib or celecoxib.

18439678|t|Porcine TLR8 and TLR7 are both activated by a selective TLR7 ligand, imiquimod.
18439678|a|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of highly conserved germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRR), which are utilized by the innate immune system to recognize microbial components, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP). We cloned and characterized porcine TLR7 and TLR8 genes from pig lymph node tissue. Sequence analysis showed that the aa sequence identities of porcine TLR7 with human, mouse and bovine TLR7 are 85, 78 and 90%, respectively, whereas porcine TLR8 aa sequence identities with human, mouse and bovine TLR8 are 73, 69 and 79%, respectively. Both porcine TLR7 and TLR8 proteins were expressed in cell lines and were N-glycosylated. The stimulatory activity of TLR7 and TLR8 ligands to porcine and human TLR7 and TLR8 in transiently transfected Cos-7 and 293T cells were analyzed using a NF-kappaB reporter assay. Two imidazoquinoline molecules, imiquimod and gardiquimod, markedly activated both porcine TLR7 and TLR8 whereas only human TLR7, but not TLR8, was activated by the ligands. Therefore, receptor specificity for porcine TLR8 is clearly species specific. We further showed that porcine TLR7 and TLR8 are located intracellularly and are mainly within the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, activation of transfected cells and porcine PBMC by TLR7 ligands was inhibited by bafilomycin A(1) indicating the requirement of endosomal/lysosomal acidification for activation of the receptors.

17199504|t|Configuration of a scintillation proximity assay for the activity assessment of recombinant human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase.
17199504|a|Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase plays a role in purine salvage by catalyzing the direct conversion of adenine to adenosine monophosphate. The involvement of the purine salvage pathway in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis makes adenine phosphoribosyltransferase a potential target for oncology drug discovery. We have expressed and characterized recombinant, N-terminally His-tagged human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. Two assay formats were assessed for use in a high throughput screen: a spectrophotometric-based enzyme-coupled assay system and a radiometric ionic capture scintillation proximity bead assay format. Ultimately, the scintillation proximity assay format was chosen because of automated screening compatibility limitations of the coupled assay. We describe here the biochemical characterization of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and the development of a robust, homogeneous, 384-well assay suitable for high throughput screening.

23406956|t|Protective role of L-carnitine and vitamin E on the testis of atherosclerotic rats.
23406956|a|Atherosclerosis is a condition caused by lipid build-up and inflammation in the arteries, so hyperlipidemia is the major reason for atherosclerosis. Testis was found to be negatively affected by hyperlipidemia which leads to its impaired functions. Vitamin E and <sc>l</sc>-carnitine have well-known lipid-lowering and antioxidative activities. Triton WR 1339 is a non-ionic detergent, which induces severe hyperlipidemia by inhibition of lipoprotein lipase. The present study evaluates the protective role of vitamin E and <sc>l</sc>-carnitine on the testis in atherosclerosis and detects the most effective choice for protection against atherosclerosis; vitamin E, <sc>l</sc>-carnitine or a combination of both. A total of 80 albino male rats were divided into eight groups (10 rats for each group): control (G(1)), triton (G(2)), <sc>l</sc>-carnitine (G(3)), triton + <sc>l</sc>-carnitine (G(4)), vitamin E (G(5)), triton + vitamin E (G(6)), <sc>l</sc>-carnitine + vitamin E (G(7)) and triton + <sc>l</sc>-carnitine + vitamin E (G(8)). Data showed a significant increase in the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 b HSD), testicular catalase and malondialdehyde (MDA) in G(2) when compared with G(1), whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), serum testosterone, testicular 17 ketosteroid reductase (17 KSR), total thiol and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) data showed a significant decrease in G(2) when compared with G(1). Treatment with <sc>l</sc>-carnitine or/and vitamin E helps in improving the adverse effect of triton; also the histological changes confirm this finding. So the present study recommends all people to include <sc>l</sc>-carnitine and vitamin E in their diet to be protected against atherosclerosis.

23451797|t|Structural Investigation and Biological Activity of Sesquiterpene Lactones from the Traditional Chinese Herb Inula racemosa.
23451797|a|Five new sesquiterpene lactones, racemosalactones A-E (1-5), along with 19 known sesquiterpene latones (6-24), were isolated from the roots of Inula racemosa. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis, and the absolute configuration of 2 was deduced from X-ray diffraction analysis. Compounds 1, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 17 exhibited antiproliferative activities with IC50 values ranging from 0.38 to 4.19 ug/mL against human non-small-cell lung cancer A549, hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2, and human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. Compounds 6 and 8 exhibited antiproliferative activities against endothelial cells with IC50 values of 2.4 and 2.5 ug/mL, respectively. Furthermore, compounds 6 and 8 both inhibited endothelial cell tube formation at 1.0 ug/mL. A method for the rapid and straightforward preparative-scale isolation of compound 6 from alantolides is described.

23376356|t|PI3 k/akt inhibition induces apoptosis through p38 activation in neurons.
23376356|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that the PI3K/AKT pathway is a pro-survival signalling system in neurons. Therefore, the inhibition of this pathway may be implicated in the degeneration of neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. Here we study the participation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT inhibition in cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor, selectively activated the p38 MAPK kinase pathway and enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation, but did not activate JNK. The pharmacological inhibitors SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) protected primary cultures of rat CGCs from LY294002-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, both compounds decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and lowered mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic gene dp5, a direct target of c-Jun. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibition induces neuronal apoptosis, a process that is mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK/c-Jun/dp5.

23600914|t|24(S)-hydroxycholesterol is actively eliminated from neuronal cells by ABCA1.
23600914|a|High cholesterol turnover catalyzed by cholesterol 24-hydroxylase is essential for neural functions, especially learning. Because 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC), produced by 24-hydroxylase, induces apoptosis of neuronal cells, it is vital to eliminate it rapidly from cells. Here, using differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells as a model, we examined whether 24-OHC is actively eliminated via transporters induced by its accumulation. The expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 was induced by 24-OHC, as well as TO901317 and retinoic acid, which are ligands of the nuclear receptors LXR/RXR. When the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 was induced, 24-OHC efflux was stimulated in the presence of high density lipoprotein (HDL), whereas apolipoprotein A-I was not an efficient acceptor. The efflux was suppressed by the addition of siRNA against ABCA1, but not by ABCG1 siRNA. To confirm the role of each transporter, we analyzed HEK293 cells stably expressing human ABCA1 or ABCG1; we clearly observed 24-OHC efflux in the presence of HDL, whereas efflux in the presence of apolipoprotein A-I was marginal. Furthermore, the treatment of primary cerebral neurons with LXR/RXR ligands suppressed the toxicity of 24-OHC. These results suggest that ABCA1 actively eliminates 24-OHC in the presence of HDL as a lipid acceptor and protects neuronal cells. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

12105857|t|Thalidomide prevents alcoholic liver injury in rats through suppression of Kupffer cell sensitization and TNF-alpha production.
12105857|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sensitization of Kupffer cells (KCs) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and overproduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha are critical for progression of alcoholic liver injury. Thalidomide has been shown to suppress TNF-alpha production from macrophages. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine whether thalidomide could prevent alcohol-induced liver injury. METHODS: Rats were given ethanol (5 g/kg body wt) and thalidomide (5 mg/kg) once every 24 hours intragastrically. To assess the sensitization of Kupffer cells, LPS (5 mg/kg intravenously) was administered and liver histology was evaluated 24 hours later. KCs were isolated after 4 weeks of ethanol treatment and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was measured using fura-2, whereas TNF-alpha was evaluated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CD14 was determined by Western and fluorescence staining. RESULTS: Treatment with ethanol for 8 weeks caused marked steatosis, necrosis, and inflammation in the liver. These pathologic parameters were diminished markedly by treatment with thalidomide. In the 4-week ethanol group, the LPS-induced liver damage was aggravated and KCs were sensitized to LPS. Coadministration of thalidomide with ethanol prevented the KC sensitization completely. Furthermore, thalidomide abolished the LPS-induced increase in CD14 expression and [Ca2+]i elevation in KCs. Gut permeability was increased about 10-fold after 4 weeks of ethanol exposure, which was not affected by thalidomide. Moreover, thalidomide reduced the LPS-induced TNF-alpha production by KCs by decreasing TNF-alpha messenger RNA. CONCLUSIONS: These results collectively indicate that thalidomide prevents alcoholic liver injury through suppression of TNF-alpha production and abolishment of KC sensitization.

11752472|t|Tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis in plants: molecular and functional characterization of dihydrofolate synthetase and three isoforms of folylpolyglutamate synthetase in Arabidopsis thaliana.
11752472|a|Tetrahydrofolate coenzymes involved in one-carbon (C1) metabolism are polyglutamylated. In organisms that synthesize tetrahydrofolate de novo, dihydrofolate synthetase (DHFS) and folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) catalyze the attachment of glutamate residues to the folate molecule. In this study we isolated cDNAs coding a DHFS and three isoforms of FPGS from Arabidopsis thaliana. The function of each enzyme was demonstrated by complementation of yeast mutants deficient in DHFS or FPGS activity, and by measuring in vitro glutamate incorporation into dihydrofolate or tetrahydrofolate. DHFS is present exclusively in the mitochondria, making this compartment the sole site of synthesis of dihydrofolate in the plant cell. In contrast, FPGS is present as distinct isoforms in the mitochondria, the cytosol, and the chloroplast. Each isoform is encoded by a separate gene, a situation that is unique among eukaryotes. The compartmentation of FPGS isoforms is in agreement with the predominance of gamma-glutamyl-conjugated tetrahydrofolate derivatives and the presence of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and C1-tetrahydrofolate interconverting enzymes in the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the plastids. Thus, the combination of FPGS with these folate-mediated reactions can supply each compartment with the polyglutamylated folate coenzymes required for the reactions of C1 metabolism. Also, the multicompartmentation of FPGS in the plant cell suggests that the transported forms of folate are unconjugated.

16336752|t|Overview of monoclonal antibodies and small molecules targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in colorectal cancer.
16336752|a|The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) provides survival signals and is overexpressed in the majority of colorectal cancers. As more is learned about the molecular details of EGFR signaling, antibodies can be designed to interfere with specific domains of the EGFR molecule. In this review, we analyze preclinical and current clinical data on EGFR-targeting molecules and their potential role in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Cetuximab binds to domain III of EGFR and hinders ligand binding. It is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for metastatic colorectal cancer treatment. Panitumumab is another widely studied anti-EGFR antibody with similar properties. Bispecific antibodies are modified immunoglobulin molecules containing 2 different binding specificities. These antibodies can redirect the immune response against tumor cells by tethering effector cells such as CD3e-expressing T cells or CD16-expressing natural killer cells and granulocytes to the surface of cancer cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are quinazoline-derived, low molecular weight synthetic molecules that can block the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of several receptors, including EGFR, Erb2, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and thereby inhibit ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation and abrogate the biologic effect of EGFR signaling. The presence of skin rash and EGFR gene amplification have been advanced as possible predictors of clinical effectiveness of targeted anti-EGFR therapies.

10546982|t|Serotonin transporter production and degradation rates: studies with RTI-76.
10546982|a|The objective of this study was to examine the turnover of the serotonin transporter (SERT) by determining its production rate (r), degradation rate constant (k) and half-life of recovery (t1/2). The turnover of SERT was determined from the rate of recovery of binding after administration of RTI-76, an irreversible inhibitor of ligand binding. In preliminary studies, in vitro incubation of rat cerebral cortex with RTI-76 produced a wash and temperature resistant inhibition of SERT binding densities (Bmax). Citalopram protected against the RTI-76-induced inhibition of SERT binding. Following 6 h of in vivo intracerebroventricular injections of 100 nmol of RTI-76, there was a dose- and time-dependent reduction (- 60%) of SERT binding in hippocampus and striatum, without a change in the Kd. SERT binding densities recovered over several days, reaching control levels by day 14. The recovery curve fit the standard model of protein synthesis and degradation. The turnover parameters of SERT were determined in hippocampus and striatum, regions that receive serotonergic innervation from the dorsal and median midbrain raphe nuclei, respectively. In the hippocampus, the production rate constant was 2.36 fmol mg protein (-1)h(-1); the degradation rate constant was 0.0077 h(-1); and the half-life of the SERT recovery was 3.4 days. The values in the striatum were similar. The decrease and recovery of [3H]-5-HT uptake correlated highly (r = 0.93) with the recovery of SERT binding.

23644191|a|A novel copper(I) Schiff base complex has been synthesized and fully characterized by spectral, analytical and structural modes. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the copper(I) complex [CuCl(PPh3)L] has a distorted tetrahedral geometry around the central copper(I) ion. The interaction of the ligand and the complex with CT-DNA has been explored by absorption titration method which revealed that the compounds could interact with CT-DNA through intercalation. A gel electrophoresis assay demonstrated the ability of the complex to cleave the pBR322 DNA. The antioxidative properties showed that the copper(I) complex has a strong radical-scavenging potency than ligands. Further the cytotoxic effect of the compounds examined on cancerous cell lines showed that the complex exhibited substantial anticancer activity.

23261676|t|(-) Epicatechin attenuates mitochondrial damage by enhancing mitochondrial multi-marker enzymes, adenosine triphosphate and lowering calcium in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats.
23261676|a|Cardiac mitochondrial damage plays an important role in the pathology of myocardial infarction. The protective effects of (-) epicatechin on cardiac mitochondrial damage in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction were evaluated in rats. Rats were pretreated with (-) epicatechin (20 mg/kg body weight) daily for a period of 21 days. After the pretreatment period, isoproterenol (100 mg/kg body weight) was injected subcutaneously into rats twice at an interval of 24 h to induce myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats showed a significant increase in the levels of cardiac diagnostic markers, heart mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, calcium, and a significant decrease in the activities/levels of heart mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, reduced glutathione, isocitrate, succinate, malate, a-ketoglutarate and NADH-dehydrogenases, cytochrome-C-oxidase and adenosine triphosphate. (-) Epicatechin pretreatment showed significant protective effects on all the biochemical parameters evaluated. The in vitro study revealed the superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of (-) epicatechin. The possible mechanisms for the beneficial effects of (-) epicatechin on cardiac mitochondria could be attributed to scavenging of free radicals, decreasing calcium, increasing multi-enzymes (antioxidant, tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiratory chain enzymes), reduced glutathione and adenosine triphosphate. Thus, (-) epicatechin attenuated mitochondrial damage in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats.

23530834|a|A novel series of (S)-phenylalanine derivatives with a 2-cyanopyrrolidine moiety were designed and synthesized through a rational drug design strategy. Biological evaluation revealed that most tested compounds were potent dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, among them, the cyclopropyl-substituted phenylalanine derivative 11h displayed the most potent DPP-4 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.247 uM. In addition, molecular docking analysis of the representative compounds 11h, 11k, and 15a were performed, which not only revealed the impact of binding modes on DPP-4 inhibitory activity, but also provided additional methodological values for design and optimization.    2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

21606412|t|Activity of XL184 (Cabozantinib), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with medullary thyroid cancer.
21606412|a|PURPOSE: XL184 (cabozantinib) is a potent inhibitor of MET, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and RET, with robust antiangiogenic, antitumor, and anti-invasive effects in preclinical models. Early observations of clinical benefit in a phase I study of cabozantinib, which included patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), led to expansion of an MTC-enriched cohort, which is the focus of this article. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study of oral cabozantinib was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors. Primary end points included evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetics, and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) determination. Additional end points included RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) response, pharmacodynamics, RET mutational status, and biomarker analyses. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled, including 37 with MTC. The MTD was 175 mg daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), mucositis, and AST, ALT, and lipase elevations and grade 2 mucositis that resulted in dose interruption and reduction. Ten (29%) of 35 patients with MTC with measurable disease had a confirmed partial response. Overall, 18 patients experienced tumor shrinkage of 30% or more, including 17 (49%) of 35 patients with MTC with measurable disease. Additionally, 15 (41%) of 37 patients with MTC had stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months, resulting in SD for 6 months or longer or confirmed partial response in 68% of patients with MTC. CONCLUSION: Cabozantinib has an acceptable safety profile and is active in MTC. Cabozantinib may provide clinical benefit by simultaneously targeting multiple pathways of importance in MTC, including MET, VEGFR2, and RET. A global phase III pivotal study in MTC is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00215605).

23097088|t|Intercellular adhesion molecule-2 is involved in apical ectoplasmic specialization dynamics during spermatogenesis in the rat.
23097088|a|In this study, we investigated the role of intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM2) in the testis. ICAM2 is a cell adhesion protein having important roles in cell migration, especially during inflammation when leukocytes cross the endothelium. Herein, we showed ICAM2 to be expressed by germ and Sertoli cells in the rat testis. When a monospecific antibody was used for immunolocalization experiments, ICAM2 was found to surround the heads of elongating/elongated spermatids in all stages of the seminiferous epithelial cycle. To determine whether ICAM2 is a constituent of apical ectoplasmic specialization (ES), co-immunoprecipitation and dual immunofluorescence staining were performed. Interestingly, ICAM2 was found to associate with b1-integrin, nectin-3, afadin, Src, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, annexin II, and actin. Following CdCl    treatment, ICAM2 was found to be upregulated during restructuring of the seminiferous epithelium, with round spermatids becoming increasingly immunoreactive for ICAM2 by 6-16 h. Interestingly, there was a loss in the binding of ICAM2 to actin during CdCl   -induced germ cell loss, suggesting that a loss of ICAM2-actin interactions might have facilitated junction restructuring. Taken collectively, these results illustrate that ICAM2 plays an important role in apical ES dynamics during spermatogenesis.

23102509|t|Efficacy of asiatic acid, a pentacyclic triterpene on attenuating the key enzymes activities of carbohydrate metabolism in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
23102509|a|Asiatic acid (AA), a triterpenoid derivative of Centella asiatica, has shown significant biological effects of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Aim of this investigation was to evaluate the antihyperglycemic effect of AA on the activities of hepatic enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. To induce diabetes mellitus, rats were injected with streptozotocin intraperitoneally at a single dose of 40 mg/kg b.w. Diabetic rats showed significant (p<0.05) increased in plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and significant (p<0.05) decreased in circulating insulin and hemoglobin. The altered activities of key enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase of carbohydrate metabolism significantly (p<0.05) increased whereas hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycogen content significantly (p<0.05) decreased in the liver of diabetic rats and also increased activities of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Oral administration of AA (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg b.w.) and glibenclamide (600 ug/kg b.w.) to diabetic rats for 45 days prevented the above alteration and reverted to near normalcy. Protection of body weight loss of diabetic rats by AA was also observed. No significant effect was observed in normal rats treated with AA (20 mg/kg b.w.). In this search, AA found to be potential bioactive compound to regulate the carbohydrate metabolism by modulating the key regulatory enzymes in diabetic rats. These findings merit further research in this field.

23468099|t|Effects of chronic social defeat stress on behavior and choline acetyltransferase, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein in adult mice.
23468099|a|RATIONALE: Social defeat stress induces physiological and behavioral symptoms, including anxiety, anhedonia, immune deficits, and altered expression of key brain genes. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the effects of social defeat stress on the behaviors and expressions of Chat, Grp78, and chop in the brains of adult mice. METHODS: Adult mice were divided into susceptible and unsusceptible groups after 10 days of social defeat stress. In experiment 1, behavioral tests were conducted, and brains were processed for Western blotting at day 27 after stress. In experiment 2, social avoidance tests were conducted, and brains were processed for Western blotting at day 12 after stress. RESULTS: The results indicate decreased and increased locomotion and anxiety behavior in all defeated mice. Decrease in social interaction, increased immobility, and impaired memory performance were only observed in susceptible mice. A decrease in the Chat level at days 12 and 27 was noted in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (Amyg), and dorsal hippocampus (HIP) in defeated mice. The expression levels of Grp78 and chop measured on days 12 and 27 were significantly greater in the Amyg of susceptible mice. In the PFC and HIP, defeated mice displayed different patterns in the levels of Grp78 and chop expressions measured on days 12 and 27. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that chronic social defeat stress in mice produces stress-related behaviors. Different response patterns were noted for Grp78 and chop expression among the groups in terms of brain regions and time-course effects.

23282066|t|Evaluation of animal models for intestinal first-pass metabolism of drug candidates to be metabolized by CYP3A enzymes via in vivo and in vitro oxidation of midazolam and triazolam.
23282066|a|Abstract 1. To search an appropriate evaluation methodology for the intestinal first-pass metabolism of new drug candidates, grapefruit juice (GFJ)- and vehicle (tap water)-pretreated mice or rats were orally administered midazolam (MDZ) or triazolam (TRZ), and blood levels of the parent compounds and their metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography/MS/MS. A significant effect of GFJ to elevate the blood levels was observed only for TRZ in mice. 2. In vitro experiments using mouse, rat and human intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions demonstrated that GFJ suppressed the intestinal microsomal oxidation of MDZ and especially TRZ. Substrate inhibition by MDZ caused reduction in 1'-hydroxylation but not 4-hydroxylation in both intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions. The kinetic profiles of MDZ oxidation and the substrate inhibition in mouse intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions were very similar to those in human microsomes but were different from those in rat microsomes. Furthermore, MDZ caused mechanism-based inactivation of cytochrome P450 3A-dependent TRZ 1'-hydroxylation in mouse, rat and human intestinal microsomes with similar potencies. 3. These results are useful information in the analysis of data obtained in mouse and rat for the evaluation of first-pass effects of drug candidates to be metabolized by CYP3A enzymes.

23703578|t|Drug-drug interactions between HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and antiviral protease inhibitors.
23703578|a|The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are a class of drugs also known as statins. These drugs are effective and widely prescribed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Seven statins are currently available: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin. Although these drugs are generally well tolerated, skeletal muscle abnormalities from myalgia to severe lethal rhabdomyolysis can occur. Factors that increase statin concentrations such as drug-drug interactions can increase the risk of these adverse events. Drug-drug interactions are dependent on statins' pharmacokinetic profile: simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, while the metabolism of the other statins is independent of this CYP. All statins are substrate of organic anion transporter polypeptide 1B1, an uptake transporter expressed in hepatocyte membrane that may also explain some drug-drug interactions. Many HIV-infected patients have dyslipidemia and comorbidities that may require statin treatment. HIV-protease inhibitors (HIV PIs) are part of recommended antiretroviral treatment in combination with two reverse transcriptase inhibitors. All HIV PIs except nelfinavir are coadministered with a low dose of ritonavir, a potent CYP3A inhibitor to improve their pharmacokinetic properties. Cobicistat is a new potent CYP3A inhibitor that is combined with elvitegravir and will be combined with HIV-PIs in the future. The HCV-PIs boceprevir and telaprevir are both, to different extents, inhibitors of CYP3A. This review summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of statins and PIs with emphasis on their metabolic pathways explaining clinically important drug-drug interactions. Simvastatin and lovastatin metabolized through CYP3A have the highest potency for drug-drug interaction with potent CYP3A inhibitors such as ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted HIV-PI or the hepatitis C virus (HCV) PI, telaprevir or boceprevir, and therefore their coadministration is contraindicated. Atorvastatin is also a CYP3A substrate, but less potent drug-drug interactions have been reported with CYP3A inhibitors. Non-CYP3A-dependent statin concentrations are also affected although to a lesser extent when coadministered with HIV or HCV PIs, mainly through interaction with OATP1B1, and treatment should start with the lowest available statin dose. Effectiveness and occurrence of adverse effects should be monitored at regular time intervals.

23542578|t|A novel method for preparing complete antigens of gonyautoxin 2,3 and their feature of immunogenicity.
23542578|a|In this paper, a novel method was proposed to prepare artificial antigens of gonyaulax parlaytic shellfish toxin 2 and 3 (GTX2,3). An intermediate GTX2,3-aldehyde was first synthesized by activating the NH2 group of the 2nd and 8th amino acid residues with three different aldehydes and two artificial complete antigens GTX2,3-aldehyde-bovine serum albumin (BSA) and GTX2,3-aldehyde- keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) were then prepared by cross-linking the intermediate with BSA or KLH. The successful preparation of the two complete antigens was confirmed by UV spectral scanning, HPLC, production of antibodies with titer of 1.28 x 10(4) from mice immunized with the two complete antigens, indirect ELISA and Western-blot. In conclusion, the synthesized complete antigens have strong immunogenicity, which provides a solid foundation for preparing GTX2,3 monoclonal antibody and rapid detection kit.

10510456|t|Inhibition of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel by cisapride: affinity for open and inactivated states.
10510456|a|1 Cisapride is a prokinetic agent which has been associated with QT prolongation, torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest. The cellular mechanism for these observations is high affinity blockade of IKr (encoded by HERG). 2 In a chronic transfection model using CHO-K1 cells, cisapride inhibited HERG tail currents after a step to +25 mV with similar potency at room and physiological temperatures (IC50 16. 4 nM at 20-22 degrees C and 23.6 nM at 37 degrees C). 3 Channel inhibition exhibited time-, voltage- and frequency-dependence. In an envelope of tails test, channel blockade increased from 27+/-8% after a 120 ms depolarizing step to 50+/-4% after a 1.0 s step. These findings suggested affinity for open and/or inactivated channel states. 4 Inactivation was significantly accelerated by cisapride in a concentration-dependent manner and there was a small (-7 mV) shift in the voltage dependence of steady state inactivation. 5 Channel blockade by cisapride was modulated by [K+]o, with a 26% reduction in the potency of channel blockade when [K+]o was increased from 1 to 10 mM. 6 In conclusion, HERG channel inhibition by cisapride exhibits features consistent with open and inactivated state binding and is sensitive to external potassium concentration. These features may have significant clinical implications with regard to the mechanism and treatment of cisapride-induced proarrhythmia.

23526644|t|Inhibition of Ebola Virus Infection: Identification of Niemann-Pick C1 as the Target by Optimization of a Chemical Probe.
23526644|a|A high throughput screen identified adamantane dipeptide 1 as an inhibitor of Ebola virus (EboV) infection. Hit-to-lead optimization to determine the structure-activity relationship (SAR) identified the more potent EboV inhibitor 2 and a photoaffinity labeling agent 3. These anti-viral compounds were employed to identify the target as Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a host protein that binds the EboV glycoprotein and is essential for infection. These studies establish NPC1 as a promising target for anti-viral therapy.

23530595|t|Bioinspired Water-Enhanced Mechanical Gradient Nanocomposite Films That Mimic the Architecture and Properties of the Squid Beak.
23530595|a|Inspired by the water-enhanced mechanical gradient character of the squid beak, we herein report a nanocomposite that mimics both the architecture and properties of this interesting natural material. Similar to the squid beak, we have developed nanocomposites where the degree of cross-linking is controlled along the length of the film. In this study, we utilized tunicate cellulose nanocrystals as the nanofiller that are functionalized with allyl moieties. Using photoinduced thiol-ene chemistry, we have been able to cross-link the CNC nanofiller. In the dry state where strong CNC interactions can occur, only a small mechanical contrast is observed between the cross-linked and uncross-linked samples. However, when the films are exposed to water, which "switches off" the noncovalent CNC interactions, a significant mechanical contrast is observed between the same films. For example, at 20 wt % CNC (in the dry film), an increase in wet modulus from 60 to 300 MPa ( 500% increase) is observed after photoirradiation. Furthermore, we show that the wet modulus can be controlled by altering the UV exposure time which allows access to mechanical gradient films.

19244097|t|Studies of the biogenic amine transporters. 13. Identification of "agonist" and "antagonist" allosteric modulators of amphetamine-induced dopamine release.
19244097|a|Recent studies identified novel allosteric modulators of the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT). N-(Diphenylmethyl)-2-phenyl-4-quinazolinamine (SoRI-9804), N-(2,2-diphenylethyl)-2-phenyl-4-quinazolinamine (SoRI-20040), and N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-2-phenyl-4-quinazolinamine (SoRI-20041) partially inhibited [(125)I]3beta-(4'-iodophenyl)tropan-2beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester (RTI-55) binding, slowed the dissociation rate of [(125)I]RTI-55 from the DAT, and partially inhibited [(3)H]dopamine uptake. In the present study, we report that SoRI-9804 and SoRI-20040, at doses that do not alter release, partially inhibited d-amphetamine-induced DAT-mediated release of [(3)H]1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))or[(3)H]dopamine from striatal synaptosomes ("DAT-mediated DA release") in a dose-dependent manner. SoRI-20041, which does not alter DAT-mediated DA release measured with [(3)H]DA, reversed the effect of SoRI-20040. SoRI-20040 and SoRI-9804 also partially inhibited DAT-mediated DA release induced by DA or (+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, demonstrating that the observed partial inhibition is not specific for a particular DAT substrate. SoRI-9804 and SoRI-20040 did not attenuate D-amphetamine-induced release of [(3)H]5-hydroxytryptamine from serotonergic, or [(3)H]MPP(+) from noradrenergic, nerve terminals. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that SoRI-9804, in contrast to cocaine, slowed D-amphetamine-induced release of [(3)H]MPP(+) from dopaminergic nerve terminals without altering the apparent rate constants. The two major findings of this study are 1) the identification of both "agonist" (SoRI-9804 and SoRI-20040) and "antagonist" (SoRI-20041) allosteric modulators of D-amphetamine-induced DAT-mediated DA release and 2) [(3)H]DA uptake and d-amphetamine-induced DAT-mediated efflux can be separately modulated. Such agents may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of stimulant addiction, Parkinson's disease, and other psychiatric disorders.

11551210|t|Cembranoid and long-chain alkanol sites on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and their allosteric interaction.
11551210|a|Long-chain alkanols are general anesthetics which can also act as uncharged noncompetitive inhibitors of the peripheral nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) by binding to one or more specific sites on the AChR. Cembranoids are naturally occurring, uncharged noncompetitive inhibitors of peripheral and neuronal AChRs, which have no demonstrable general anesthetic activity in vivo. In this study, [3H]tenocyclidine ([3H]TCP), an analogue of the cationic noncompetitive inhibitor phencyclidine (PCP), was used to characterize the cembranoid and long-chain alkanol sites on the desensitized Torpedo californica AChR and to investigate if these sites interact. These studies confirm that there is a single cembranoid site which sterically overlaps the [3H]TCP channel site. This cembranoid site probably also overlaps the sites for the cationic noncompetitive inhibitors, procaine and quinacrine. Evidence is also presented for one or more allosteric cembranoid sites which negatively modulate cembranoid affinity for the inhibitory site. In contrast, long-chain alkanols inhibit [3H]TCP binding through an allosteric mechanism involving two or more alkanol sites which display positive cooperativity toward each other. Double inhibitor studies show that the cembranoid inhibitory site and the alkanol sites are not independent of each other but interfere allosterically with each other's inhibition of [3H]TCP binding. The simplest models consistent with the observed data are presented and discussed.

12047490|t|A comparison of the effects of nabumetone vs meloxicam on serum thromboxane B2 and platelet function in healthy volunteers.
12047490|a|AIMS: To compare the effects of nabumetone and meloxicam, two cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) preferential nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), on platelet COX-1 activity and platelet function. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers (3 male, 9 female, median age 22 years) participated in an open, randomized, cross-over trial of nabumetone 1000 mg twice daily vs meloxicam 7.5 mg twice daily during 1 week with 2 weeks wash-out. After a second 2 week wash-out period, one dose of indomethacin 50 mg was given as a positive control to check for NSAID induced inhibition of platelet function. COX-1 inhibition was measured as percentage inhibition of serum TXB2 generation in clotting whole blood, and as closure time with use of the platelet function analyser PFA-100. Data are reported as median with range. Paired variables were analysed using Wilcoxons signed rank test. RESULTS: TXB2 levels decreased significantly after all three medications, but percentage inhibition after nabumetone and indomethacin (88% and 97%, respectively) was significantly higher than after meloxicam (63%) (P<0.05). Closure times increased significantly after administration of all three medications (P<0.05). Increases in closure time after administration did not differ between nabumetone and meloxicam (24% and 14%, respectively), but were significantly larger after indomethacin administration (63%) (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In the maximum registered dosage, nabumetone inhibits thromboxane production much more than meloxicam, signifying less COX-2 selectivity of the former. However, both nabumetone and meloxicam cause only minor impairment in platelet function in comparison with indomethacin and the difference between them is not significant.

23220618|t|Antithrombotic and profibrinolytic activities of isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside and hyperoside.
23220618|a|The potential anticoagulant activities of two single compounds, isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside (IMG) and hyperoside, from Oenanthe javanica, were tested. The anticoagulant activities were investigated by measuring activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT), and the ability to inhibit production of thrombin and activated factor X (FXa) was investigated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). And, the effects of the compounds on expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) were tested in tumor necrosis factor-(TNF)-a activated HUVECs. Treatment with IMG and hyperoside resulted in significantly prolonged aPTT and PT and inhibition of the activities of thrombin and FXa, and IMG or hyperoside inhibited production of thrombin and FXa in HUVECs. In accordance with these anticoagulant activities, both agents elicited anticoagulant effects in mouse. In addition, treatment with IMG and hyperoside resulted in inhibition of TNF-a-induced production of PAI-1, and treatment with IMG resulted in significant reduction of the PAI-1 to t-PA ratio. The anticoagulant and profibrinolytic effects of IMG were greater than those of hyperoside, indicating positive regulation of its anticoagulant function by the methoxy group of IMG. IMG and hyperoside possess antithrombotic activities and offer bases for development of a novel anticoagulant.

23362135|t|Tumor localization and biochemical response to cure in tumor-induced osteomalacia.
23362135|a|Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare disorder of phosphate wasting due to fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23)-secreting tumors that are often difficult to locate. We present a systematic approach to tumor localization and post-operative biochemical changes in 31 subjects with TIO. All had failed either initial, or re-localization (in case of recurrence or metastases at outside institutions). Functional imaging with (111) Indium- octreotide with single photon emission computed tomography (octreo-SPECT or SPECT/CT), and (18) fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) were performed, followed by anatomic imaging (CT,MRI). Selective venous sampling (VS) was performed when multiple suspicious lesions were identified or high surgical risk was a concern. Tumors were localized in 20/31 subjects (64.5%). Nineteen of 20 subjects underwent octreo-SPECT imaging, and 16/20 FDG-PET/CT imaging. Eighteen of 19 (95%) were positive on octreo-SPECT, and 14/16 (88%) on FDG-PET/CT. Twelve of 20 subjects underwent VS; 10/12 (83%) were positive. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were: sensitivity=0.95, specificity=0.64, PPV=0.82 and NPV=0.88 for octreo-SPECT; sensitivity=0.88, specificity=0.36, PPV=0.62 and NPV=0.50 for FDG-PET/CT. Fifteen subjects had their tumor resected at our institution, and were disease-free at last follow-up. Serum phosphorus returned to normal in all subjects within 1-5 days. In 10 subjects who were followed for at least 7 days postoperatively, intact FGF23 (iFGF23) decreased to near undetectable within hours and returned to the normal range within 5 days. C-terminal FGF23 (cFGF23) decreased immediately but remained elevated, yielding a markedly elevated cFGF23/iFGF23 ratio. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D) rose and exceeded the normal range. In this systematic approach to TIO tumor localization Octreo-SPECT was more sensitive and specific, but in many cases FDG-PET/CT was complementary. VS can discriminate between multiple suspicious lesions and increase certainty prior to surgery. Sustained elevations in cFGF23 and 1,25D were observed, suggesting novel regulation of FGF23 processing and 1,25D generation.    2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

8730743|t|Desipramine administration in the olfactory bulbectomized rat: changes in brain beta-adrenoceptor and 5-HT2A binding sites and their relationship to behaviour.
8730743|a|1. The effects of repeated administration of the tricyclic antidepressant drug, desipramine (DMI), on behaviour (locomotor activity and rearing) and the number and affinity of brain beta-adrenoceptor and 5-HT2A receptor binding sites were examined in olfactory bulbectomized (OB) and sham-operated control rats. 2. Locomotor activity and rearing were increased in OB rats compared to sham-operated controls. The effect of various doses of DMI (administered orally twice daily for 21 days) on these behavioural measures was examined. A dose of 7.5 mg kg-1 provided optimal reversal of hyperlocomotion and increased rearing in OB rats, without changing these measures in sham-operated controls. 3. The time course of DMI (7.5 mg kg-1) on behavioural and neurochemical measures was examined. locomotion and rearing in OB rats were not significantly altered after 7 days, were significantly attenuated after 14 days and were normalized after 21 days. 4. After 7 days of DMI administration the number of beta-adrenoceptors was lower in frontal and occipital cortex and hippocampus. This reduction was largely restricted to the beta 1-adrenoceptor subtype. Administration of DMI for 14 or 21 days did not further reduce the number of beta-adrenoceptors. The DMI induced reduction in beta-adrenoceptors did not differ in OB and sham-operated control rats. 5. DMI administration for up to 21 days produced a progressive reduction in the number of 5-HT2A receptors in frontal cortex, without significant alterations in occipital cortex. 6. The time course of the reduction in the number of 5-HT2A receptors was similar to that of the DMI-induced behavioural changes whereas that for the reduction in beta-adrenoceptors was clearly different. 7. The present results suggest that the action of DMI in this animal model is unlikely to be directly related to a reduction in beta-adrenoceptors but may be related to a reduction in frontal cortical 5-HT2A receptors.

23360232|t|Surface-modified HK:siRNA nanoplexes with enhanced pharmacokinetics and tumor growth inhibition.
23360232|a|We characterized in this study the pharmacokinetics and antitumor efficacy of histidine-lysine (HK):siRNA nanoplexes modified with PEG and a cyclic RGD (cRGD) ligand targeting avb3 and avb5 integrins. With noninvasive imaging, systemically administered surface-modified HK:siRNA nanoplexes showed nearly 4-fold greater blood levels, 40% higher accumulation in tumor tissue, and 60% lower luciferase activity than unmodified HK:siRNA nanoplexes. We then determined whether the surface-modified HK:siRNA nanoplex carrier was more effective in reducing MDA-MB-435 tumor growth with an siRNA targeting Raf-1. Repeated systemic administration of the selected surface modified HK:siRNA nanoplexes targeting Raf-1 showed 35% greater inhibition of tumor growth than unmodified HK:siRNA nanoplexes and 60% greater inhibition of tumor growth than untreated mice. The improved blood pharmacokinetic results and tumor localization observed with the integrin-targeting surface modification of HK:siRNA nanoplexes correlated with greater tumor growth inhibition. This investigation reveals that through control of targeting ligand surface display in association with a steric PEG layer, modified HK: siRNA nanoplexes show promise to advance RNAi therapeutics in oncology and potentially other critical diseases.

12827214|t|Pharmacological characterization of unique prazosin-binding sites in human kidney.
12827214|a|In human kidney, we found unique prazosin-binding sites that were insensitive to phentolamine and were thus unlikely to be alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. As the binding of [(3)H]prazosin to phentolamine-insensitive sites was prevented by 100 microM guanabenz, the insensitive sites were evaluated by subtracting [(3)H]prazosin binding in the presence of 100 microM guanabenz from that in the presence of 10 microM phentolamine. [(3)H]Prazosin bound to the phentolamine-insensitive sites monophasically with a high affinity (pK(d); 9.1+/-0.08, n=8), and the B(max) value (814+/-204 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=8) was more than ten times that of the phentolamine-sensitive alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (pK(d)=9.9+/-0.13, B(max)=66+/-23 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=7). The phentolamine-insensitive sites in human kidney were highly sensitive to other quinazoline derivatives such as terazosin and doxazosin. However, other alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists (tamsulosin, WB4101 and corynanthine) did not inhibit the binding at a range of concentrations that generally exhibit alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonism, and noradrenaline, rauwolscine and propranolol were without effect on the [(3)H]prazosin binding. On the other hand, ligands for the renal Na(+)-transporter (amiloride and triamterene) and for imidazoline recognition sites (guanabenz, guanfacine and agmatine) displaced the binding of [(3)H]prazosin to phentolamine-insensitive sites at micromolar concentrations. Photoaffinity labeling with [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin showed phentolamine-insensitive labeling at around 100 kDa, a molecular size larger than that of human alpha(1a)- and alpha(1b)-adrenoceptors expressed in 293 cells (50-60 and 70-80 kDa, respectively) on electrophoresis. In contrast, there was no detectable phentolamine-insensitive binding site but were phentolamine-sensitive alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in human liver (pK(d)=10.0+/-0.06, B(max)=44+/-6 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=3). Phentolamine-insensitive prazosin binding sites were also detected in rabbit kidney (approximately 50% of specific binding sites) but were minor in rat kidney (less than 20%). In conclusion, there are unique prazosin-binding sites in human kidney, the pharmacological profiles of which were distinct from those of known adrenoceptors.

23249751|t|Rapid and specific purification of Argonaute-small RNA complexes from crude cell lysates.
23249751|a|Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct Argonaute proteins, the core components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), to cleave complementary target RNAs. Here, we describe a method to purify active RISC containing a single, unique small RNA guide sequence. We begin by capturing RISC using a complementary 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotide tethered to beads. Unlike other methods that capture RISC but do not allow its recovery, our strategy purifies active, soluble RISC in good yield. The method takes advantage of the finding that RISC partially paired to a target through its siRNA guide dissociates more than 300 times faster than a fully paired siRNA in RISC. We use this strategy to purify fly Ago1- and Ago2-RISC, as well as mouse AGO2-RISC. The method can discriminate among RISCs programmed with different guide strands, making it possible to deplete and recover specific RISC populations. Endogenous microRNA:Argonaute complexes can also be purified from cell lysates. Our method scales readily and takes less than a day to complete.

23352910|t|Cell penetrating peptide tethered bi-ligand liposomes for delivery to brain in vivo: Biodistribution and transfection.
23352910|a|Targeted nano-particulate systems hold extraordinary potential for delivery of therapeutics across blood brain barrier (BBB). In this work, we investigated the potential of novel bi-ligand (transferrin-poly-l-arginine) liposomal vector for delivery of desired gene to brain, in vivo. The in vivo evaluation of the delivery vectors is essential for clinical translation. We followed an innovative approach of combining transferrin receptor targeting with enhanced cell penetration to design liposomal vectors for improving the transport of molecules into brain. The biodistribution profile of 1, 1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine iodide(DiR)-labeled liposomes was evaluated in adult rats after single intravenous injection at dose of 15.2umoles of phospholipids/kg body weight. We demonstrated that bi-ligand liposomes accumulated in rat brain at significantly (p<0.05) higher concentrations as compared to the single-ligand (transferrin) or plain liposomes. In addition, the bi-ligand liposomes resulted in increased expression of b-galactosidase(b-gal) plasmid in rat brain tissue in comparison to the single-ligand liposomes. Histological examination of the transfected tissues did not show any signs of tissue necrosis or inflammation. Hemolysis assay further authenticated the biocompatibility of bi-ligand liposomes in blood up to 600 nmoles of phospholipids/1.4x10(7) erythrocytes. The findings of this study provide important and detailed information regarding the distribution of bi-ligand liposomes in vivo and accentuate their ability to demonstrate improved brain penetration and transfection potential over single-ligand liposomes.

17380207|t|Mesenchymal cells regulate the response of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to asparaginase.
17380207|a|Because of their low asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression and asparagine biosynthesis, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are exquisitely sensitive to asparagine depletion. Consequently, asparaginase is a major component of ALL therapy, but the mechanisms regulating the susceptibility of leukemic cells to this agent are unclear. In 288 children with ALL, cellular ASNS expression was more likely to be high in T-lineage ALL and low in B-lineage ALL with TEL-AML1 or hyperdiploidy. However, ASNS expression levels in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (MSCs), which form the microenvironment where leukemic cells grow, were on average 20 times higher than those in ALL cells. MSCs protected ALL cells from asparaginase cytotoxicity in coculture experiments. This protective effect correlated with levels of ASNS expression: downregulation by RNA interference decreased the capacity of MSCs to protect ALL cells from asparaginase, whereas enforced ASNS expression conferred enhanced protection. Asparagine secretion by MSCs was directly related to their ASNS expression levels, suggesting a mechanism - increased concentrations of asparagine in the leukemic cell microenvironment - for the protective effects we observed. These results provide what we believe to be a new basis for understanding asparaginase resistance in ALL and indicate that MSC niches in the bone marrow can form a safe haven for leukemic cells.

23428368|t|Hyperthyroidism causes cardiac dysfunction by mitochondrial impairment and energy depletion.
23428368|a|This study elucidates the role of metabolic remodeling in cardiac dysfunction induced by hyperthyroidism. Cardiac hypertrophy, structural remodeling, and expression of the genes associated with fatty acid metabolism were examined in rats treated with triiodothyronine (T3) alone (8 ug/100 g body weight (BW), i.p.) for 15 days or along with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonist bezafibrate (Bzf; 30 ug/100 g BW, oral) and were found to improve in the Bzf co-treated condition. Ultrastructure of mitochondria was damaged in T3-treated rat heart, which was prevented by Bzf co-administration. Hyperthyroidism-induced oxidative stress, reduction in cytochrome c oxidase activity, and myocardial ATP concentration were also significantly checked by Bzf. Heart function studied at different time points during the course of T3 treatment shows an initial improvement and then a gradual but progressive decline with time, which is prevented by Bzf co-treatment. In summary, the results demonstrate that hyperthyroidism inflicts structural and functional damage to mitochondria, leading to energy depletion and cardiac dysfunction.

12165285|a|The human platelet antigen-1 (HPA-1, Pl(A)) polymorphism has been proposed to influence the inhibitory actions of abciximab. Thus, we hypothesized that this polymorphism might also be the cause for paradoxical activation of platelets by GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors. The effects of abciximab (1-10 microg/ml), tirofiban (3-30 nM), or eptifibatide (0.3-3 microg/ml) on basal and ADP (3 microM)-induced CD62P externalization were measured in n=62 healthy blood donors and n=177 patients with stable coronary artery disease. All subjects were genotyped for the human platelet antigen-1 (HPA-1, Pl(A)) polymorphism by GALIOS(R) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Although a significant platelet hyperreactivity was observed in the patients, the HPA-1 genotype did not influence basal or ADP-induced CD62P expression. A moderate (twofold) stimulation of CD62P expression by abciximab but not by tirofiban or eptifibatide was observed in one patient. Interestingly, this patient carried the HPA-1 b/b genotype. In no other subject any activation of platelets by GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors was observed and there were no statistically significant differences between HPA-1 genotypes with respect to the effects of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors on basal or ADP-stimulated CD62P expression. It is concluded that paradoxical platelet activation by abciximab is a rare (<2%) phenomenon. HPA-1 b/b genotype might be a contributing factor but clearly does not predict platelet activation by GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.

23428346|t|Atorvastatin withdrawal elicits oxidative/nitrosative damage in the rat cerebral cortex.
23428346|a|Statins are inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins effectively prevent and reduce the risk of coronary artery disease through lowering serum cholesterol, and also exert anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects independently of changes in cholesterol levels. On the other hand, clinical and experimental evidence suggests that abrupt cessation of statin treatment (i.e. statin withdrawal) is associated with a deleterious rebound phenomenon. In fact, statin withdrawal increases the risk of thrombotic vascular events, causes impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation and facilitates experimental seizures. However, evidence for statin withdrawal-induced detrimental effects to the brain parenchyma is still lacking. In the present study adult male Wistar rats were treated with atorvastatin for seven days (10mg/kg/day) and neurochemical assays were performed in the cerebral cortex 30min (atorvastatin treatment) or 24h (atorvastatin withdrawal) after the last atorvastatin administration. We found that atorvastatin withdrawal decreased levels of nitric oxide and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activity, whereas increased NADPH oxidase activity and immunoreactivity for the protein nitration marker 3-nitrotyrosine in the cerebral cortex. Catalase, glutathione-S-transferase and xanthine oxidase activities were not altered by atorvastatin treatment or withdrawal, as well as protein carbonyl and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal immunoreactivity. Immunoprecipitation of mitochondrial SOD followed by analysis of 3-nitrotyrosine revealed increased levels of nitrated mitochondrial SOD, suggesting the mechanism underlying the atorvastatin withdrawal-induced decrease in enzyme activity. Altogether, our results indicate the atorvastatin withdrawal elicits oxidative/nitrosative damage in the rat cerebral cortex, and that changes in NADPH oxidase activity and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activities may underlie such harmful effects.

17507169|t|Cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus and central control of penile erection: immunocytochemistry, autoradiography and behavioral studies.
17507169|a|[N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxyamide] (SR 141716A), a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of male rats, induces penile erection. This effect is mediated by the release of glutamic acid, which in turn activates central oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection. Double immunofluorescence studies with selective antibodies against CB1 receptors, glutamic acid transporters (vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (VGlut1 and VGlut2), glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (GAD67) and oxytocin itself, have shown that CB1 receptors in the PVN are located mainly in GABAergic terminals and fibers surrounding oxytocinergic cell bodies. As GABAergic synapses in the PVN impinge directly on oxytocinergic neurons or on excitatory glutamatergic synapses, which also impinge on oxytocinergic neurons, these results suggest that the blockade of CB1 receptors decreases GABA release in the PVN, increasing in turn glutamatergic neurotransmission to activate oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection. Autoradiography studies with [(3)H](-)-CP 55,940 show that chronic treatment with SR 141716A for 15 days twice daily (1 mg/kg i.p.) significantly increases the density of CB1 receptors in the PVN. This increase occurs concomitantly with an almost twofold increase in the pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A injected into the PVN as compared with control rats. The present findings confirm that PVN CB1 receptors, localized mainly in GABAergic synapses that control in an inhibitory fashion excitatory synapses, exert an inhibitory control on penile erection, demonstrating for the first time that chronic blockade of CB1 receptors by SR 141716A increases the density of these receptors in the PVN. This increase is related to an enhanced pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A, which is still present 3 days after the end of the chronic treatment.

7768269|t|Discriminative stimulus effects of esteratic local anesthetics in squirrel monkeys.
7768269|a|A number of esteratic local anesthetics serve as positive reinforcers and produce cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects in animals. It has been suggested that the affinity of these compounds for a site on the dopamine transporter, and not their local anesthetic actions, is responsible for these abuse-related behavioral effects. In the present study, three local anesthetics previously shown to be self-administered in animals were examined in squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate cocaine (0.3 mg/kg) from saline in a two-lever, food-reinforced procedure. Dimethocaine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) fully and dose-dependently substituted for cocaine. Doses of dimethocaine (1.7 mg/kg) and cocaine (0.3 mg/kg) which produced full (> 80%) substitution for cocaine were administered in combination with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 39166 ((-)-trans-6,7,7a,8,9,13b-hexahydro-3-chloro-2-hydroxy-N-methyl-5H -benzo [d]naphtho-(2,1-b)azepine) and the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist raclopride (both at 0.003-0.03 mg/kg). SCH 39166 fully blocked the cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects of dimethocaine and cocaine, but raclopride produced only partial antagonism of cocaine-lever selection. In addition, there was some evidence that raclopride blocked cocaine-lever responding produced by a lower dose of dimethocaine. In substitution studies, neither procaine (1-10 mg/kg) nor chloroprocaine (1-30 mg/kg) produced cocaine-like effects. These results support a role for dopamine in the behavioral effects of some local anesthetics.

14638499|t|Molecular mechanism of terbinafine resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
14638499|a|Ten mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae resistant to the antimycotic terbinafine were isolated after chemical or UV mutagenesis. Molecular analysis of these mutants revealed single base pair exchanges in the ERG1 gene coding for squalene epoxidase, the target of terbinafine. The mutants did not show cross-resistance to any of the substrates of various pleiotropic drug resistance efflux pumps tested. The ERG1 mRNA levels in the mutants did not differ from those in the wild-type parent strains. Terbinafine resistance was transmitted with the mutated alleles in gene replacement experiments, proving that single amino acid substitutions in the Erg1 protein were sufficient to confer the resistance phenotype. The amino acid changes caused by the point mutations were clustered in two regions of the Erg1 protein. Seven mutants carried the amino acid substitutions F402L (one mutant), F420L (one mutant), and P430S (five mutants) in the C-terminal part of the protein; and three mutants carried an L251F exchange in the central part of the protein. Interestingly, all exchanges identified involved amino acids which are conserved in the squalene epoxidases of yeasts and mammals. Two mutations that were generated by PCR mutagenesis of the ERG1 gene and that conferred terbinafine resistance mapped in the same regions of the Erg1 protein, with one resulting in an L251F exchange and the other resulting in an F433S exchange. The results strongly indicate that these regions are responsible for the interaction of yeast squalene epoxidase with terbinafine.

23274086|t|AMPK is a negative regulator of the Warburg effect and suppresses tumor growth in vivo.
23274086|a|AMPK is a metabolic sensor that helps maintain cellular energy homeostasis. Despite evidence linking AMPK with tumor suppressor functions, the role of AMPK in tumorigenesis and tumor metabolism is unknown. Here we show that AMPK negatively regulates aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) in cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. Genetic ablation of the a1 catalytic subunit of AMPK accelerates Myc-induced lymphomagenesis. Inactivation of AMPKa in both transformed and nontransformed cells promotes a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis, increased allocation of glucose carbon into lipids, and biomass accumulation. These metabolic effects require normoxic stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), as silencing HIF-1a reverses the shift to aerobic glycolysis and the biosynthetic and proliferative advantages conferred by reduced AMPKa signaling. Together our findings suggest that AMPK activity opposes tumor development and that its loss fosters tumor progression in part by regulating cellular metabolic pathways that support cell growth and proliferation.

22931533|t|Cholinergic modulation by opioid receptor ligands: potential application to Alzheimer's disease.
22931533|a|Morphinans have a storied history in medicinal chemistry as pain management drugs but have received attention as modulators of cholinergic signaling for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Galantamine is a reversible, competitive acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor and allosteric potentiating ligand of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR-APL) that shares many common structural elements with morphinan-based opioids. The structurally diverse opioids codeine and eseroline, like galantamine, are also nAChR-APL that have greatly diminished affinity for AChE, representing potential lead compounds for selective nAChR-APL development. In accordance with the emerging repurposing trend of evaluating known compounds for novel pharmacological activity, ongoing research on augmentation of cholinergic signaling that has been aided by the use of opioids will be reviewed.

10406837|t|Torasemide inhibits angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and intracellular calcium increase in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats.
10406837|a|Torasemide is a loop diuretic that is effective at low once-daily doses in the treatment of arterial hypertension. Because its antihypertensive mechanism of action may not be based entirely on the elimination of salt and water from the body, a vasodilator effect of this drug can be considered. In the present study, the ability of different concentrations of torasemide to modify angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced vascular responses was examined, with the use of an organ bath system, in endothelium-denuded aortic rings from spontaneously hypertensive rats. Ang II-induced increases of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) were also examined by image analysis in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from spontaneously hypertensive rats. A dose-response curve to Ang II was plotted for cumulative concentrations (from 10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L) in endothelium-denuded aortic rings (pD(2)=7.5+/-0.3). Isometric contraction induced by a submaximal concentration of Ang II (10(-7) mol/L) was reduced in a dose-dependent way by torasemide (IC(50)=0.5+/-0.04 micromol/L). Incubation of VSMCs with different concentrations of Ang II (from 10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L) resulted in a dose-dependent rise of [Ca(2+)](i) (pD(2)=7.5+/-0.3). The stimulatory effect of [Ca(2+)](i) induced by a submaximal concentration of Ang II (10(-7) mol/L) was blocked by torasemide (IC(50)=0.5+/-0.3 nmol/L). Our findings suggest that torasemide blocks the vasoconstrictor action of Ang II in vitro. This action can be related to the ability of torasemide to block the increase of [Ca(2+)](i) induced by Ang II in VSMCs. It is proposed that these actions might be involved in the antihypertensive effect of torasemide observed in vivo.

22872607|a|Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) metabolize a wide range of substrates, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), generating metabolites (o-quinones) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are capable of initiating and promoting carcinogenesis. Exposure to PAHs, their metabolites, and ROS further increase AKRs isoform expression that may amplify oxidative damage. Human AKR enzymes are highly polymorphic, and allelic variants may contribute to different AKRs expression in individuals. Despite the importance of AKRs in PAHs metabolism, there are no studies that evaluate, in general human populations, the effect of PAHs on AKRs expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of tobacco smoke exposure, and AKR1A1*2 and AKR1C3*2 polymorphisms, on AKR1A1 and AKR1C1-AKR1C3 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in PBLs from smokers. In the smoker group, there is a statistically significant positive association between AKR1A1, AKR1C1, and AKR1C3 mRNA induction and urine cotinine levels in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) less than 25. However, AKR1A1*2 and AKR1C3*2 alleles did not influence AKR1A1 and AKR1C1-AKR1C3 mRNA levels. These results suggest that AKRs induction by PAHs in smokers' PBLs is associated with BMI; therefore, the role of adipose tissue accumulation in PAHs' effects needs further investigation.

23481236|t|Modulation of cellular insulin signaling and PTP1B effects by lipid metabolites in skeletal muscle cells.
23481236|a|Normal glucose regulation is achieved by having adequate insulin secretion and effective glucose uptake/disposal. Excess lipids in peripheral tissues - skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue - may attenuate insulin signaling through the protein kinase B (AKt) pathway and up-regulate protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative regulator of insulin signaling. We studied accumulation of lipid metabolites [triglycerides (TAGs), diglycerides (DAGs)] and ceramides in relation to insulin signaling and expression and phosphorylation of PTP1B by preincubating rat skeletal muscle cells (L6 myotubes) with three saturated and three unsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) (200 uM). Cells were also evaluated in the presence of wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and thus AKt (0-100 nM). Unsaturated FFAs increased DAGs, TAGs and PTP1B expression significantly, but cells remained insulin sensitive as assessed by robust AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at serine (Ser) 50, Ser 398 and tyrosine 152. Saturated palmitic and stearic acids increased ceramides, up-regulated PTP1B, and had AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50 impaired. We show a significant correlation between phosphorylation levels of AKt and of PTP1B at Ser 50 (R(2)=0.84, P<.05). The same was observed with increasing wortmannin dose (R(2)=0.73, P<.05). Only FFAs that increased ceramides caused impairment of AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50. PTP1B overexpression in the presence of excess lipids may not directly cause insulin resistance unless it is accompanied by decreased PTP1B phosphorylation. A clear relationship between PTP1B phosphorylation levels at Ser 50 and its negative effect on insulin signaling is shown.

19962254|t|Breast cancer and steroid metabolizing enzymes: the role of progestogens.
19962254|a|It is well documented that breast tissue, both normal and cancerous, contains all the enzymatic systems necessary for the bioformation and metabolic transformation of estrogens, androgens and progesterone. These include sulfatases, aromatase, hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenases, sulfotransferases, hydroxylases and glucuronidases. The control of these enzymes plays an important role in the development and pathogenesis of hormone-dependent breast cancer. As discussed in this review, various progestogens including dydrogesterone and its 20alpha-dihydro-derivative, medrogestone, promegestone, nomegestrol acetate and norelgestromin can reduce intratissular levels of estradiol in breast cancer by blocking sulfatase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 1 activities. A possible correlation has been postulated between breast cell proliferation and estrogen sulfotransferase activity. Progesterone is largely transformed in the breast; normal breast produces mainly 4-ene derivatives, whereas 5alpha-derivatives are most common in breast cancer tissue. It has been suggested that this specific conversion of progesterone may be involved in breast carcinogenesis. In conclusion, treatment with anti-aromatases combined with anti-sulfatase or 17beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 1 could provide new therapeutic possibilities in the treatment of patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer.

23395914|t|Site dependent intestinal absorption of darunavir and its interaction with ketoconazole.
23395914|a|The expression of P-gp increases from proximal to distal parts of the small intestine, whereas for P450 enzymes the expression is reported to be highest in duodenum and jejunum, decreasing to more distal sites. To evaluate to what extent the regional differences in expression of P-gp and P450 enzymes affect the absorption of a dual substrate, we investigated the transport of darunavir across different small intestinal segments (duodenum, proximal jejunum and ileum). Moreover, the effect of ketoconazole on the intestinal absorption of darunavir was explored, since these drugs are commonly co-administered. Performing the rat in situ intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling, we found no significant differences in the transport of darunavir at the different intestinal segments. The involvement of P-gp in the absorption of darunavir was clearly shown by coperfusion of darunavir with the P-gp inhibitor zosuquidar. In presence of zosuquidar, a 2.2-, 4.2- and 5.7-fold increase in Papp values were measured for duodenum, proximal jejunum and ileum, respectively. Involvement of P450 mediated metabolism in the absorption of darunavir could not be demonstrated in this rat model. Upon studying the drug-drug interaction of darunavir with ketoconazole, data were indicative for an inhibitory effect of ketoconazole on P-gp as the main mechanism for the increased transport of darunavir across the small intestine.

9851542|t|Pressor and bradycardic effects of tacrine and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the rat.
9851542|a|The cardiovascular effects of three different acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: physostigmine, tacrine and rivastigmine injected by intravenous (i.v.) route were compared in freely moving Wistar rats. The three drugs significantly increased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and decreased heart rate. Compared to physostigmine, a 20-fold higher dose of tacrine and a 40-fold higher dose of rivastigmine was necessary to induce a comparable pressor effect. Tacrine was chosen as a model to study the mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of i.v. cholinesterase inhibitors. Atropine totally abolished while methylatropine did not affect tacrine pressor effects. Conversely, both drugs abolished tacrine-induced bradycardia. The alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin or the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist, [beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopenta-methylenepropionyl1, O-Me-Tyr2, Arg8] vasopressin partially but significantly reduced tacrine pressor effect and mostly abolished it when administered concomitantly. The tacrine pressor response was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the i.c.v. administration of the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (ID50 = 1.45 microg), the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (ID50 = 4.33 microg), the muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist methoctramine (ID50 = 1.39 microg) and the muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (ID50 = 31.19 microg). Central injection of such muscarinic receptor antagonists did not affect tacrine-induced bradycardia. Our results show that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors induce significant cardiovascular effects with a pressor response mediated mainly by the stimulation of central muscarinic M2 receptors inducing a secondary increase in sympathetic outflow and vasopressin release. Conversely, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor-induced bradycardia appears to be mediated by peripheral muscarinic mechanisms.

12719755|t|Angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan and the defence reaction in the anaesthetised rat. Effect on the carotid chemoreflex.
12719755|a|Modulation at the level of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) appears to be an effective way of controlling cardiovascular reflexes. Angiotensin II acting on angiotensin AT1 receptors at the central nervous system appears to have an important role in these modulatory processes. The hypothalamic defence area (HDA) is a potential source of descending fibres containing angiotensin II that innervate the NTS. We investigated the effect of AT1 receptor blockade in the NTS on the response to stimulation of HDA in anaesthetised rats treated with the neuromuscular blocking agent pancuronium bromide. The characteristic increase in heart rate, blood pressure and phrenic nerve activity evoked by electrical stimulation of HDA is decreased by the microinjection of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan into the NTS and the cardiovascular response to carotid body chemical stimulation is also reduced. These results support the hypothesis that AT1 receptors in the NTS play a role in the modulation of cardiovascular reflexes, and modify the influence exerted on the processing of these reflexes by other areas of the central nervous system.

23221006|t|Role of organic cation/carnitine transporter 1 in uptake of phenformin and inhibitory effect on complex I respiration in mitochondria.
23221006|a|Phenformin causes lactic acidosis in clinical situations due to inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. It is reportedly taken up by hepatocytes and exhibits mitochondrial toxicity in the liver. In this study, uptake of phenformin and [(14)C]tetraethylammonium (TEA) and complex I inhibition by phenformin were examined in isolated liver and heart mitochondria. Uptake of phenformin into isolated rat liver mitochondria was higher than that into heart mitochondria. It was inhibited by several cat ionic compounds, which suggests the involvement of multispecific transport system(s). Similar characteristics were also observed for uptake of TEA; however, uptake of phenformin into mitochondria of organic cation/carnitine transporter 1 (OCTN1) knockout mice was lower than that in wild-type mice, whereas uptake of TEA was comparable between the two strains, suggesting the involvement of distinct transport mechanisms for these two cations in mitochondria. Inhibition by phenformin of oxygen consumption via complex I respiration in isolated rat liver mitochondria was greater than that in heart mitochondria, whereas inhibitory effect of phenformin on complex I respiration was similar in inside-out structured submitochondrial particles prepared from rat livers and hearts. Lactic acidosis provoked by iv infusion of phenformin was weaker in octn1(-/-) mice than that in wild-type mice. These observations suggest that uptake of phenformin into liver mitochondria is at least partly mediated by OCTN1 and functionally relevant to its inhibition potential of complex I respiration. This study was, thus, the first to demonstrate OCTN1-mediated mitochondrial transport and toxicity of biguanide in vivo in rodents.

We examined the modifying effect of co-administration with EMIQ on the liver tissue environment including hepatic macrophages and lymphocytes and on the induction mechanism of preneoplastic cell apoptosis during early stages of hepatocellular tumor promotion. TAA increased the number and area of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)(+) liver cell foci and the numbers of proliferating and apoptotic cells in randomly selected areas in liver sections. Co-administration with EMIQ suppressed these effects. TAA also increased the numbers of ED2(+), cyclooxygenase-2(+), and heme oxygenase-1(+) liver cells, as well as the number of CD3(+) lymphocytes. These effects were also suppressed by EMIQ. EMIQ increased liver levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, and TUNEL(+) apoptotic cells, death receptor 5 (DR5)(+) cells and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal(+) cells within GST-P(+) foci. Outside the GST-P(+) foci, EMIQ decreased the numbers of apoptotic cells and DR5(+) cells. These results suggest that TAA-induced tumor promotion involves activation of hepatic macrophages producing proinflammatory factors. EMIQ may suppress the TAA-induced tumor-promoting activity by an anti-inflammatory mechanism mediated by suppressing the activation of these macrophages. Furthermore, EMIQ may suppress tumor-promoting activity differentially between the inside and outside of GST-P(+) foci. Within GST-P(+) foci, EMIQ facilitates the apoptosis of preneoplastic cells through the upregulation of DR5. Outside the GST-P(+) foci, EMIQ suppresses apoptosis and the subsequent regeneration of non-transformed liver cells.

17138606|t|Increased responsiveness of rat colonic splanchnic afferents to 5-HT after inflammation and recovery.
17138606|a|5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) activates colonic splanchnic afferents, a mechanism by which it has been implicated in generating symptoms in postinfectious and postinflammatory states in humans. Here we compared mechanisms of colonic afferent activation by 5-HT and mechanical stimuli in normal and inflamed rat colon, and after recovery from inflammation. Colonic inflammation was induced in rats by dextran sulphate sodium. Single-fibre recordings of colonic lumbar splanchnic afferents revealed that 58% of endings responded to 5-HT (10(-4) m) in controls, 88% in acute inflammation (P<0.05) and 75% after 21 days recovery (P < 0.05 versus control). Maximal responses to 5-HT were also larger, and the estimated EC50 was reduced from 3.2 x 10(-6) to 8 x 10(-7) m in acute inflammation and recovered to 2 x 10(-6) m after recovery. Responsiveness to mechanical stimulation was unaffected. 5-HT3 receptor antagonism with alosetron reduced responses to 5-HT in controls but not during inflammation. Responses to the mast cell degranulator 48/80 mimicked those to 5-HT in inflamed tissue but not in controls, and more 5-HT-containing mast cells were seen close to calcitonin gene-related peptide-containing fibres in inflamed serosa. We conclude that colonic serosal and mesenteric endings exhibit increased sensitivity to 5-HT in inflammation, with both an increase in proportion of responders and an increase in sensitivity, which is maintained after healing of inflammation. This is associated with alterations in the roles of 5-HT3 receptors and mast cells.

17218486|t|Trace amine-associated receptor 1 displays species-dependent stereoselectivity for isomers of methamphetamine, amphetamine, and para-hydroxyamphetamine.
17218486|a|The synthetic amines methamphetamine (METH), amphetamine (AMPH), and their metabolite para-hydroxyamphetamine (POHA) are chemically and structurally related to the catecholamine neurotransmitters and a small group of endogenous biogenic amines collectively referred to as the trace amines (TAs). Recently, it was reported that METH, AMPH, POHA, and the TAs para-tyramine (TYR) and beta-phenylethylamine (PEA) stimulate cAMP production in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells expressing rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (rTAAR1). The discovery that METH and AMPH activate the rTAAR1 motivated us to study the effect of these drugs on the mouse TAAR1 (mTAAR1) and a human-rat chimera (hrChTAAR1). Furthermore, because S-(+)-isomers of METH and AMPH are reported to be more potent and efficacious in vivo than R-(-), we determined the enantiomeric selectivity of all three species of TAAR1. In response to METH, AMPH, or POHA exposure, the accumulation of cAMP by HEK-293 cells stably expressing different species of TAAR1 was concentration- and isomer-dependent. EC50 values for S-(+)-METH were 0.89, 0.92, and 4.44 microM for rTAAR1, mTAAR1, and h-rChTAAR1, respectively. PEA was a potent and full agonist at each species of TAAR1, whereas TYR was a full agonist for the rodent TAAR1s but was a partial agonist at h-rChTAAR1. Interestingly, both isomers of METH were full agonists at mTAAR1 and h-rChTAAR1, whereas both were partial agonists at rTAAR1. Taken together, these in vitro results suggest that, in vivo, TAAR1 could be a novel mediator of the effects of these drugs.

23230131|t|Pharmacogenomics of gemcitabine metabolism: functional analysis of genetic variants in cytidine deaminase and deoxycytidine kinase.
23230131|a|Gemcitabine (dFdC, 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine) is metabolized by cytidine deaminase (CDA) and deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), but the contribution of genetic variation in these enzymes to the variability in systemic exposure and response observed in cancer patients is unclear. Wild-type enzymes and variants of CDA (Lys27Gln and Ala70Thr) and DCK (Ile24Val, Ala119Gly, and Pro122Ser) were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli, and enzyme kinetic parameters were estimated for cytarabine (Ara-C), dFdC, and its metabolite 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) as substrates. All three CDA proteins showed similar K(m) and V(max) for Ara-C and dFdC deamination, except for CDA70Thr, which had a 2.5-fold lower K(m) and 6-fold lower V(max) for Ara-C deamination. All four DCK proteins yielded comparable metabolic activity for Ara-C and dFdC monophosphorylation, except for DCK24Val, which demonstrated an approximately 2-fold increase (P < 0.05) in the intrinsic clearance of dFdC monophosphorylation due to a 40% decrease in K(m) (P < 0.05). DCK did not significantly contribute to dFdU monophosphorylation. In conclusion, the Lys27Gln substitution does not significantly modulate CDA activity toward dFdC, and therefore would not contribute to interindividual variability in response to gemcitabine. The higher in vitro catalytic efficiency of DCK24Val toward dFdC monophosphorylation may be relevant to dFdC clinical response. The substrate-dependent alterations in activities of CDA70Thr and DCK24Val in vitro were observed for the first time, and demonstrate that the in vivo consequences of these genetic variations should not be extrapolated from one substrate of these enzymes to another.

10575283|t|Cannabis and cannabinoids: pharmacology and rationale for clinical use.
10575283|a|It is now known that there are at least two types of cannabinoid receptors. These are CB1 receptors, present mainly on central and peripheral neurones, and CB2 receptors, present mainly on immune cells. Endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists ('endocannabinoids') have also been identified. The discovery of this 'endogenous cannabinoid system' has led to the development of selective CB1 and CB2 receptor ligands and fueled renewed interest in the clinical potential of cannabinoids. Two cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonists are already used clinically, as antiemetics or as appetite stimulants. These are D 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and nabilone. Other possible uses for CB1 receptor agonists include the suppression of muscle spasm/spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, the relief of chronic pain and the management of glaucoma and bronchial asthma. CB1 receptor antagonists may also have clinical applications, e. g. as appetite suppressants and in the management of schizophrenia or disorders of cognition and memory. So too may CB2 receptor ligands and drugs that activate cannabinoid receptors indirectly by augmenting endocannabinoid levels at cannabinoid receptors. When taken orally, THC seems to undergo variable absorption and to have a narrow 'therapeutic window' (dose range in which it is effective without producing significant unwanted effects). This makes it difficult to predict an oral dose that will be both effective and tolerable to a patient and indicates a need for better cannabinoid formulations and modes of administration. For the therapeutic potential of cannabis or CB1 receptor agonists to be fully exploited, it will be important to establish objectively and conclusively (a) whether these agents have efficacy against selected symptoms that is of clinical significance and, if so, whether the benefits outweigh the risks, (b) whether cannabis has therapeutic advantages over individual cannabinoids, (c) whether there is a need for additional drug treatments to manage any of the disorders against which cannabinoids are effective, and (d) whether it will be possible to develop drugs that have reduced psychotropic activity and yet retain the ability to act through CB1 receptors to produce their sought-after effects.

15777622|t|Apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) safeguards pig proximal tubular LLC-PK1 cells against reduction in SGLT1 activity induced by gentamicin C.
15777622|a|Megalin, a family of endocytic receptors related to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, is a major pathway for proximal tubular aminoglycoside accumulation. We previously reported that aminoglycoside antibiotics reduce SGLT1-dependent glucose transport in pig proximal tubular epithelial LLC-PK1 cells in parallel with the order of their nephrotoxicity. In this study, using a model of gentamicin C (GMC)-induced reduction in SGLT1 activity, we examined whether ligands for megalin protect LLC-PK1 cells from the GMC-induced reduction in SGLT1 activity. We employed apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) and lactoferrin as ligands for megalin. Then the cells were treated with various concentrations of apoE3, lactoferrin and bovine serum albumin with or without 100 microg/ml of GMC, and the SGLT1-dependent methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside (AMG) uptake and levels of SGLT1 expression were determined. As a result, we demonstrated that the apoE3 significantly protects these cells from GMC-induced reduction in AMG uptake, but neither lactoferrin nor albumin does. In accord with a rise in AMG uptake activity, the mRNA and protein levels of SGLT1 were apparently up-regulated in the presence of apoE3. Furthermore, we found that the uptake of [3H] gentamicin is decreased by apoE3, and that apoE3 showed obvious protection against the GMC-dependent N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamidase (NAG) release from LLC-PK1 cells. Thus, these results indicate that apoE3 could be a valuable tool for the prevention of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity.

23600800|t|CASK is a new intracellular modulator of P2X3 receptors.
23600800|a|ATP-gated P2X3 receptors of sensory ganglion neurons are important transducers of painful stimuli and are modulated by extracellular algogenic substances, via changes in the receptor phosphorylation state. The present study investigated the role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase CASK in interacting and controlling P2X3 receptor expression and function in mouse trigeminal ganglia. Most ganglion neurons in situ or in culture co-expressed P2X3 and CASK. CASK was immunoprecipitated with P2X3 receptors from trigeminal ganglia and from P2X3/CASK-cotransfected HEK cells. Recombinant P2X3/CASK expression in HEK cells increased serine phosphorylation of P2X3 receptors, typically associated with receptor upregulation. CASK deletion mutants also enhanced P2X3 subunit expression. After silencing CASK, cell surface P2X3 receptor expression was decreased, which is consistent with depressed P2X3 currents. The reduction of P2X3 expression levels was reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132. Moreover, neuronal CASK/P2X3 interaction was upregulated by NGF signaling and downregulated by P2X3 agonist-induced desensitization. These data suggest a novel interaction between CASK and P2X3 receptors with positive outcome for receptor stability and function. As CASK-mediated control of P2X3 receptors was dependent on the receptor activation state, CASK represents an intracellular gateway to regulate purinergic nociceptive signaling.

15561973|t|Substrate specificity of the human renal sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter, hNaDC-3, under voltage-clamp conditions.
15561973|a|Proximal tubule cells extract dicarboxylates from filtrate and blood, using cotransporters located in the brush border [sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter (NaDC-1)] and basolateral cell membrane (NaDC-3). We expressed the human NaDC-3 (hNaDC-3) in Xenopus laevis oocytes and characterized it by the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. At -60 mV, succinate (4 carbons) and glutarate (5 carbons) generated inward currents due to translocation of three sodium ions and one divalent dicarboxylate, whereas oxalate (2 carbons) and malonate (3 carbons) did not. The cis-dicarboxylate maleate produced currents smaller in magnitude, whereas the trans-dicarboxylate fumarate generated currents similar to succinate. The substituted succinate derivatives, malate, 2,2- and 2,3-dimethylsuccinate, and 2,3-dimercaptosuccinate elicited inward currents, whereas aspartate and guanidinosuccinate showed hardly detectable currents. The C-5 dicarboxylates glutarate and alpha-ketoglutarate produced larger currents than succinate; glutamate and folate failed to cause inward currents. Kinetic analysis revealed, at -60 mV, K(0.5) values of 25 +/- 12 microM for succinate and 45 +/- 13 microM for alpha-ketoglutarate, values close to the plasma concentration of these compounds. For both compounds, the K(0.5) was independent of voltage, whereas the maximal current increased with hyperpolarization. As opposed to the rat and flounder orthologs, hNaDC-3 was hardly inhibited by lithium concentrations up to 5 mM. In the absence of sodium, however, lithium can mediate succinate-dependent currents. The narrow substrate specificity prevents interaction of drugs with dicarboxylate-like structure with hNaDC-3 and ensures sufficient support of the proximal tubule cells with alpha-ketoglutarate for anion secretion via organic anion transporter 1 or 3.

10583449|t|Pretreatment renal vascular tone predicts the effect of specific renin inhibition on natriuresis in essential hypertension.
10583449|a|BACKGROUND: In essential hypertension an elevated renal vascular resistance (RVR) may be a marker of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-mediated impairment of renal sodium excretion. This hypothesis was tested by investigating whether, in subjects with essential hypertension, the natriuretic response to specific renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade by renin-inhibitor remikiren could be predicted from pretreatment renal vascular tone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Renal hemodynamics, and the effects of single (n = 17) and multiple doses (n = 8, 8 days) of remikiren (600 mg day-1) on sodium excretion were studied under conditions of carefully controlled sodium balance. RESULTS: Pretreatment renal vascular tone showed considerable individual differences: filtration fraction (FF) ranged from 21.2 to 30.3% and RVR from 18.8 to 33.5 10-2 mmHg min mL-1 in the single dose study, and FF from 20.8 to 24.9% and RVR from 14.8 to 28.8 10-2 mmHg min mL-1 in the multiple dose study. Remikiren induced a fall in blood pressure, FF and RVR, with considerable interindividual variability in natriuretic response. During single dose, cumulative sodium loss was 5.1 mmol per 5 h (-8.8 to +24.6), whereas after 8 days treatment cumulative sodium loss was 72 +/- 30 mmol (-46 to +187). The natriuretic response to remikiren during single as well as multiple dose significantly correlated with pretreatment renal vascular tone (estimated from FF and RVR) but not with remikiren-induced changes in renal hemodynamics or in hormonal parameters. Cumulative sodium loss was largest in patients with a higher pretreatment FF and RVR (r = 0.74, P < 0.001 and r = 0.52, P < 0.05, respectively, single dose; and r = 0.75, P < 0.05 and r = 0.73, P < 0.05, respectively, multiple dose). CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that in essential hypertension an elevated renal vascular tone is a marker of RAAS-mediated impairment of sodium excretion.

18035186|t|Comprehensive review of rasagiline, a second-generation monoamine oxidase inhibitor, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
18035186|a|BACKGROUND: Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) with selectivity and specificity for MAO type B (MAO-B) prolong the duration of action of both endogenously and exogenously derived dopamine. Rasagiline [N-propargyl-l(R)-aminoindan] is a second-generation propargylamine pharmacophore that selectively and irreversibly inhibits brain MAO-B and is specifically designed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the pharmacology, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of rasagiline in the treatment of PD. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966-April 2007), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2007) were searched for original research and review articles published in English. The search terms were monoamine oxidase, neuroprotection, Parkinson disease, propargylamine, rasagiline, and selegiline. The reference lists of articles were also consulted, as was information provided by the manufacturer of rasagiline. RESULTS: Data from 63 clinical and laboratory studies were analyzed. Based on the results from those studies, we concluded that rasagiline PO QD, at the therapeutic dosage range of 0.5 to 1 rag/d, is effective and well tolerated and completely, selectively, and specifically inhibited MAO-B. Pharmacologically, rasagiline was found to be < or =10-fold more potent than selegiline and was not metabolized to amphetamine derivatives. Rasagiline was effective both as monotherapy in early PD and as adjunctive treatment in patients with advancing PD and motor fluctuations. As monotherapy, rasagiline provided modest yet clinically meaningful benefit. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that, after 26 weeks of treatment, the adjusted effect size for total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score was -4.20 (95% CI, -5.66 to -2.73) for rasagiline 1 mg/d versus placebo (P < 0.001). Preliminary long-term data from an open-label study suggest a sustained therapeutic advantage when rasagiline is initiated early (before the need for dopaminergic agents) rather than later. In patients with more advanced disease who received treatment with dopaminergic agents, rasagiline and entacapone were associated with reductions of "off" time significantly greater than placebo (-1.18 and -1.2 vs 0.4 hour; both, P < or = 0.001). Rasagiline was well tolerated in younger (aged <;70 years) and older (aged > or =70 years) patients with early or advanced PD. Pharmacologically, rasagiline has the potential to augment the vasopressor effects of diet-derived tyramine (ie, the "cheese reaction"). However, clinical challenge studies of tyramine have found this unlikely to occur even with ingestion of supraphysiologic amounts of tyramine. In experimental models, rasagiline has been found to have neuroprotective properties that may be independent of MAO-B inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this review, rasagiline has been found to be well tolerated and effective in the treatment of early PD and as adjunctive treatment in motor fluctuations. Whether rasagiline is associated with clinically significant neuroprotection (ie, disease modification) in PD is the subject of ongoing clinical trials.

23139413|t|Long range effect of mutations on specific conformational changes in the extracellular loop 2 of angiotensin II type 1 receptor.
23139413|a|The topology of the second extracellular loop (ECL2) and its interaction with ligands is unique in each G protein-coupled receptor. When the orthosteric ligand pocket located in the transmembrane (TM) domain is occupied, ligand-specific conformational changes occur in the ECL2. In more than 90% of G protein-coupled receptors, ECL2 is tethered to the third TM helix via a disulfide bond. Therefore, understanding the extent to which the TM domain and ECL2 conformations are coupled is useful. To investigate this, we examined conformational changes in ECL2 of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) by introducing mutations in distant sites that alter the activation state equilibrium of the AT1R. Differential accessibility of reporter cysteines introduced at four conformation-sensitive sites in ECL2 of these mutants was measured. Binding of the agonist angiotensin II (AngII) and inverse agonist losartan in wild-type AT1R changed the accessibility of reporter cysteines, and the pattern was consistent with ligand-specific "lid" conformations of ECL2. Without agonist stimulation, the ECL2 in the gain of function mutant N111G assumed a lid conformation similar to AngII-bound wild-type AT1R. In the presence of inverse agonists, the conformation of ECL2 in the N111G mutant was similar to the inactive state of wild-type AT1R. In contrast, AngII did not induce a lid conformation in ECL2 in the loss of function D281A mutant, which is consistent with the reduced AngII binding affinity in this mutant. However, a lid conformation was induced by [Sar(1),Gln(2),Ile(8)] AngII, a specific analog that binds to the D281A mutant with better affinity than AngII. These results provide evidence for the emerging paradigm of domain coupling facilitated by long range interactions at distant sites on the same receptor.

10702256|t|SPACRCAN, a novel human interphotoreceptor matrix hyaluronan-binding proteoglycan synthesized by photoreceptors and pinealocytes.
10702256|a|The interphotoreceptor matrix is a unique extracellular complex occupying the interface between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium in the fundus of the eye. Because of the putative supportive role in photoreceptor maintenance, it is likely that constituent molecules play key roles in photoreceptor function and may be targets for inherited retinal disease. In this study we identify and characterize SPACRCAN, a novel chondroitin proteoglycan in this matrix. SPACRCAN was cloned from a human retinal cDNA library and the gene localized to chromosome 3q11.2. Analysis of SPACRCAN mRNA and protein revealed that SPACRCAN is expressed exclusively by photoreceptors and pinealocytes. SPACRCAN synthesized by photoreceptors is localized to the interphotoreceptor matrix where it surrounds both rods and cones. The functional protein contains 1160 amino acids with a large central mucin domain, three consensus sites for glycosaminoglycan attachment, two epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a putative hyaluronan-binding motif, and a potential transmembrane domain near the C-terminal. Lectin and Western blotting indicate an M(r) around 400,000 before and 230,000 after chondroitinase ABC digestion. Removal of N- and O-linked oligosaccharides reduces the M(r) to approximately 160,000, suggesting that approximately 60% of the mass of SPACRCAN is carbohydrate. Finally, we demonstrate that SPACRCAN binds hyaluronan and propose that associations between SPACRCAN and hyaluronan may be involved in organization of the insoluble interphotoreceptor matrix, particularly as SPACRCAN is the major proteoglycan present in this matrix.

9712175|t|Effect of lintitript, a new CCK-A receptor antagonist, on gastric emptying of a solid-liquid meal in humans.
9712175|a|The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the regulation of gastric emptying of physiological meals containing solids and liquids in humans remains controversial. We studied the role of endogenous CCK in the emptying of a solid/liquid meal administering the new, highly specific and potent CCK-A receptor antagonist lintitript. Gastric emptying was assessed in nine healthy male volunteers using a randomized, double blind, two-period crossover design with oral lintitript (15 mg 1 h prior to meal intake) or placebo on two different days. After ingestion of a pancake (570 kcal) labelled with 500 microCi of 99mTc-sulfur colloid and 500 ml 10% dextrose containing 80 microCi. 111In-DTPA, subjects were studied in a sitting position, using a dual-headed gamma camera. Plasma CCK and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were measured by a specific RIA. Lintitript distinctly accelerated gastric emptying of solids, while gastric emptying of liquids was not significantly altered. The lag period was shortened by 20% (P<0.05), AUC and half emptying time of solid emptying were lowered by 12% and 13%, respectively (P<0.03). Lintitript markedly increased postprandial plasma CCK release (P<0.001) while distinctly reducing postprandial PP levels (P<0.01) as compared to placebo. These data provide further evidence for a significant role of CCK in the regulation of gastric emptying of solids. The study demonstrates for the first time the marked gastrokinetic properties of the new CCK-A receptor antagonist lintitript in humans.

23042954|t|Efficacy of the GluK1/AMPA receptor antagonist LY293558 against seizures and neuropathology in a soman-exposure model without pretreatment and its pharmacokinetics after intramuscular administration.
23042954|a|Control of brain seizures after exposure to nerve agents is imperative for the prevention of brain damage and death. Animal models of nerve agent exposure make use of pretreatments, or medication administered within 1 minute after exposure, in order to prevent rapid death from peripheral toxic effects and respiratory failure, which then allows the testing of anticonvulsant compounds. However, in a real-case scenario of an unexpected attack with nerve agents, pretreatment would not be possible, and medical assistance may not be available immediately. To determine if control of seizures and survival are still possible without pretreatment or immediate pharmacologic intervention, we studied the anticonvulsant efficacy of the GluK1 (GluR5)/a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist (3S,4aR,6R,8aR)-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazole-5-yl)ethyl]decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (LY293558) in rats that did not receive any treatment until 20 minutes after exposure to the nerve agent soman. We injected LY293558 intramuscularly, as this would be the most likely route of administration to humans. LY293558 (15 mg/kg), injected along with atropine and the oxime HI-6 at 20 minutes after soman exposure, stopped seizures and increased survival rate from 64% to 100%. LY293558 also prevented neuronal loss in the amygdala and hippocampus, and reduced neurodegeneration in a number of brain regions studied 7 days after soman exposure. Analysis of the LY293558 pharmacokinetics after intramuscular administration showed that this compound readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. There was good correspondence between the time course of seizure suppression by LY293558 and the brain levels of the compound.

1705137|t|Comparison of the monoamine oxidase inhibiting properties of two reversible and selective monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors moclobemide and toloxatone, and assessment of their effect on psychometric performance in healthy subjects.
1705137|a|1. The effects of two reversible, predominantly monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibitors, moclobemide (150 mg three times daily) and toloxatone (400-200-400 mg day-1) on monoamine metabolites and psychometric performance were compared in a double-blind placebo controlled crossover study in 12 healthy subjects. 2. After 7 days of moclobemide/toloxatone/placebo administration subjects were hospitalized for 24 h on day 8. Blood samples were drawn every 2 h for determination of plasma noradrenaline (NA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA). Urine was collected for measurements of normetanephrine and 3-methoxytyramine excretion. Psychometric performance (short- and long-term memory, critical flicker fusion frequency, choice reaction time) and subjective feelings were assessed before each drug intake (in the morning, at noon, in the evening). 3. Compared with placebo, both reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors decreased the plasma concentration of DHPG and HVA. The overall fall in DHPG (AUC from 0 to 24 h) was 44% during moclobemide and 12% during toloxatone (P less than 0.001) and the overall decrease in HVA was 38% and 20% (P less than 0.005) on moclobemide and toloxatone, respectively. 4. Before the next drug intake, MAO-A inhibition, as judged by the decrease of plasma DHPG concentration, was significantly different from placebo with moclobemide but not with toloxatone. 5. Moclobemide, but not toloxatone, exerted a moderate, but significant inhibition of the deamination of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as judged by the fall in plasma 5-HIAA concentration. Neither drug influenced plasma NA concentration. 6. A significant rise in urinary excretion of normetanephrine was observed on moclobemide and to a lesser extent on toloxatone. The urinary excretion of 3-methoxytyramine was significantly raised by moclobemide but not by toloxatone. 7. Neither moclobemide nor toloxatone altered memory function, vigilance, subjective feelings or sleep characteristics of the subjects.

17477831|t|Discovery of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase 2 inhibitors: comparison of a fluorescence intensity-based phosphate assay and a fluorescence polarization-based ADP Assay for high-throughput screening.
17477831|a|Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) enzymes exist as two isoforms, ACC1 and ACC2, which play critical roles in fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidation. Though each isoform differs in tissue and subcellular localization, both catalyze the biotin- and ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-coenzyme A to generate malonyl-coenzyme A, a key metabolite in the control of fatty acid synthesis and oxidation. The cytosolic ACC1 is expressed primarily in liver and adipose tissue, and uses malonyl-coenzyme A as a key building block in fatty acid biosynthesis. The mitochondrial ACC2 is primarily expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, where it is involved in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Inhibitors of ACC enzymes may therefore be useful therapeutics for diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Two assay formats for these ATP-utilizing enzymes amenable to high-throughput screening are compared: a fluorescence intensity-based assay to detect inorganic phosphate and a fluorescence polarization-based assay to detect ADP. Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase inhibitors were identified by these high-throughput screening methods and were confirmed in a radiometric high performance liquid chromatography assay of malonyl-coenzyme A production.

23127916|t|Polymorphisms in OCTN1 and OCTN2 transporters genes are associated with prolonged time to progression in unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumours treated with imatinib therapy.
23127916|a|The two basic mainstays of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) treatment are surgery and imatinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that allows achieving a stable or responding disease in about 80% of patients with unresectable/metastatic GIST. Response to imatinib mainly depends from KIT and PDGFRa mutational status. Nevertheless, some patients with a potentially responsive genotype do not respond, and others develop a pattern of resistance to imatinib which is not associated with secondary mutations. This emphasizes the presence of mechanisms of resistance other than the receptor-related genotype, and the need of biological predictors to select the optimal therapeutic strategy, particularly now that other potent inhibitors are available. We investigated a panel of 31 polymorphisms in 11 genes, potentially associated with the pharmacogenetics of imatinib, in a group of 54 unresectable/metastatic GISTs treated with imatinib 400mg daily as first line therapy. Included in this analysis were polymorphisms in the transporters' family SLC22, SLCO, ABC, and in the metabolizing genes CYP-3A4 and -3A5. Time to progression was significantly improved in presence of the C allele in SLC22A4 (OCTN1 rs1050152), and the two minor alleles (G) in SLC22A5 (OCTN2 rs2631367 and rs2631372). Importantly, multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, KIT/PDGFRa mutational status, and tumour size, revealed that all the three genotypes maintained independent predictive significance. In conclusion, in this study we showed that SLC22A4 and SLC22A5 genotypes may be an important predictor of time to progression in GIST patients receiving imatinib therapy. Further investigations are required in an attempt to further personalize GIST therapy.

17256745|t|Human and rat bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase are liver-specific peroxisomal enzymes: implications for intracellular bile salt transport.
17256745|a|UNLABELLED: Bile acid-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) is the sole enzyme responsible for conjugation of primary and secondary bile acids to taurine and glycine. Previous studies indicate a peroxisomal location of BAAT in peroxisomes with variable amounts up to 95% detected in cytosolic fractions. The absence or presence of a cytosolic pool of BAAT has important implications for the intracellular transport of unconjugated/deconjugated bile salts. We used immunofluorescence microscopy and digitonin permeabilization assays to determine the subcellular location of endogenous BAAT in primary human and rat hepatocytes. In addition, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged rat Baat (rBaat) and human BAAT (hBAAT) were transiently expressed in primary rat hepatocytes and human fibroblasts. Catalase and recombinant GFP-SKL and DsRed-SKL were used as peroxisomal markers. Endogenous hBAAT and rBaat were found to specifically localize to peroxisomes in human and rat hepatocytes, respectively. No significant cytosolic fraction was detected for either protein. GFP-tagged hBAAT and rBaat were efficiently sorted to peroxisomes of primary rat hepatocytes. Significant amounts of GFP-tagged hBAAT or rBaat were detected in the cytosol only when coexpressed with DsRed-SKL, suggesting that hBAAT/rBaat and DsRed-SKL compete for the same peroxisomal import machinery. When expressed in fibroblasts, GFP-tagged hBAAT localized to the cytosol, confirming earlier observations. CONCLUSION: hBAAT and rBaat are peroxisomal enzymes present in undetectable amounts in the cytosol. Unconjugated or deconjugated bile salts returning to the liver need to shuttle through the peroxisome before reentering the enterohepatic circulation.

18068977|a|Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is an enzyme responsible for the inactivation of the glucoregulatory incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). In this report, we show that the hypolipidemic agent atorvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of porcine DPP-IV in vitro, with K(i)=57.8+/-2.3 microM. These results may have implications in the development of novel DPP-IV inhibitors based on the use of atorvastatin as a lead compound for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

23066089|t|Activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors potentiates heteromeric kainate receptors.
23066089|a|Kainate receptors (KARs), a family of ionotropic glutamate receptors, are widely expressed in the central nervous system and are critically involved in synaptic transmission. KAR activation is influenced by metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu) signaling, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We undertook studies to examine how mGlu modulation affects activation of KARs. Confocal immunohistochemistry of rat hippocampus and cultured rat cortex revealed colocalization of the high-affinity KAR subunits with group I mGlu receptors. In hippocampal and cortical cultures, the calcium signal caused by activation of native KARs was potentiated by activation of group I mGlu receptors. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, activation of group I mGlu receptors potentiated heteromeric but not homomeric KAR-mediated currents, with no change in agonist potency. The potentiation of heteromeric KARs by mGlu1 activation was attenuated by GDPbS, blocked by an inhibitor of phospholipase C or the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), prolonged by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, but unaffected by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition reduced the potentiation by mGlu1 of GluK2/GluK5, and conversely, direct activation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate,13-acetate potentiated GluK2/GluK5. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified three serines (Ser833, Ser836, and Ser840) within the membrane proximal region of the GluK5 C-terminal domain that, in combination, are required for mGlu1-mediated potentiation of KARs. Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of key residues in the C-terminal domain changes the overall charge of this domain, resulting in potentiated agonist responses.

23194076|t|Diet, physical exercise and Orlistat administration increase serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
23194076|a|The present study investigates the combined effect of diet, physical exercise and Orlistat for 24 weeks, on serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and in overweight and obese controls. Sixty-one (61) selected women with PCOS and 20 overweight and obese controls followed an energy-restricted diet, physical exercise plus Orlistat administration (120 mg, 3 times per day) for 24 weeks. At baseline, week 12 and week 24, serum levels of AMH, FSH, LH, PRL, androgens, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), glucose, and insulin were measured and Free Androgen Index (FAI) and Insulin Resistance (IR) indices were calculated. In PCOS women, serum AMH levels increased after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. After 12 weeks LH and SHBG were increased, while Testosterone decreased. After 12 and 24 weeks, FAI was decreased and all indices of IR were significantly improved. We concluded that in overweight and obese women with PCOS Orlistat administration, combined with diet and physical exercise, for 24 weeks, resulted in significant weight loss, improvement of hyperandrogenism and insulin sensitivity, and increased serum AMH levels.

22982218|t|The PARP inhibitor PJ34 modifies proliferation, NIS expression and epigenetic marks in thyroid cancer cell lines.
22982218|a|Since PARP-1 is supposed to be part of a multimeric repressor of sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expression, in this study the effect of the PARP inhibitor PJ34 on several properties of thyroid cancer cell lines was investigated. In TPC1, BCPAP, FRO, WRO cell lines PJ34 induced a strong increase in NIS mRNA levels. In BCPAP and TPC1 cells also significant increase of radio-iodine uptake was induced. Accordingly, in transfection experiments performed in TPC1 cells, treatment with PJ34 increased NIS promoter activity without affecting PARP-1 binding to the promoter sequence. We also investigated the epigenetic status of NIS promoter after PJ34 treatment in TPC1 cell line: in addition to an increase of histone modification activation marks (H3K9K14ac, H3K4me3), surprisingly we observed also an increase of H3K27me3, a classical repressive mark. Our data demonstrate that in various thyroid cancer cell lines PARP inhibition increases NIS gene expression through a particular modulation of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, we suggest that PARP inhibitors may deserve future investigations as tools for medical treatment of thyroid cancer.

10640321|t|The antitussive activity of delta-opioid receptor stimulation in guinea pigs.
10640321|a|In this study, the activity of the delta-opioid receptor subtype-selective agonist, SB 227122, was investigated in a guinea pig model of citric acid-induced cough. Parenteral administration of selective agonists of the delta-opioid receptor (SB 227122), mu-opioid receptor (codeine and hydrocodone), and kappa-opioid receptor (BRL 52974) produced dose-related inhibition of citric acid-induced cough with ED(50) values of 7.3, 5.2, 5.1, and 5.3 mg/kg, respectively. The nonselective opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (3 mg/kg, i.m.), attenuated the antitussive effects of codeine or SB 227122, indicating that the antitussive activity of both compounds is opioid receptor-mediated. The delta-receptor antagonist, SB 244525 (10 mg/kg, i.p.), inhibited the antitussive effect of SB 227122 (20 mg/kg, i.p.). In contrast, combined pretreatment with beta-funaltrexamine (mu-receptor antagonist; 20 mg/kg, s.c.) and norbinaltorphimine (kappa-receptor antagonist; 20 mg/kg, s.c.), at doses that inhibited the antitussive activity of mu- and kappa-receptor agonists, respectively, was without effect on the antitussive response of SB 227122 (20 mg/kg, i.p.). The sigma-receptor antagonist rimcazole (3 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited the antitussive effect of dextromethorphan (30 mg/kg, i.p.), a sigma-receptor agonist, but not that of SB 227122. These studies provide compelling evidence that the antitussive effects of SB 227122 in this guinea pig cough model are mediated by agonist activity at the delta-opioid receptor.

16846546|t|Comparison of cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity and ocular anti-inflammatory effects of ketorolac tromethamine and bromfenac sodium.
16846546|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and anti-inflammatory effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ketorolac tromethamine (ketorolac) and bromfenac sodium (bromfenac). METHODS: Cyclooxygenase activity and selectivity was determined in vitro by measuring prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production following incubation of varying concentrations of NSAID with human recombinant COX-1 or COX-2 and arachidonic acid. Anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in a rabbit model in which an ocular inflammatory response was induced by intravenous injection of 10 microg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In study animals, one eye was treated with 50 microL (+/-) ketorolac 0.4% (Acular LS) or bromfenac 0.09% (Xibrom) and the other eye with 50 microL buffered saline. In control animals, both eyes were treated with vehicle. All animals were treated twice: 2 hours and 1 hour before LPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PGE(2) production in vitro, measured by enzyme immunoassay; fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran leakage into the anterior chamber, measured by fluorophotometry; aqueous PGE(2) levels in vivo, measured by ELISA immunoassay. RESULTS: Ketorolac was six times more active against COX-1 (IC(50) = 0.02 microM) than COX-2 (IC(50) = 0.12 microM) while bromfenac was approximately 32 times more active against COX-2 (IC(50) = 0.0066 microM) than COX-1 (IC(50) = 0.210 microM). In the animal model, both drugs resulted in nearly complete inhibition of FITC-dextran leakage and PGE(2) production in the anterior chamber of treated eyes. There was also a 79% inhibition (p < 0.001) of FITC-dextran leakage in the contralateral eyes of bromfenac-treated rabbits, and a 22.5% inhibition (not statistically significant) in the contralateral eyes of ketorolac-treated rabbits. CONCLUSIONS: Ketorolac is relatively COX-1 selective while bromfenac is potently selective for COX-2 over COX-1. In the animal model, both ketorolac 0.4% and bromfenac 0.09% demonstrated maximal anti-inflammatory activity in treated eyes. Only bromfenac 0.09% had a significant effect on the contralateral eye, suggesting possible systemic absorption of this drug.

14613270|t|Turnover of type II collagen and aggrecan in cartilage matrix at the onset of inflammatory arthritis in humans: relationship to mediators of systemic and local inflammation.
14613270|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine in vivo the extent of damage to, and changes in turnover of, articular cartilage type II collagen (CII) and the proteoglycan aggrecan following the onset of inflammatory arthritis in humans, and to examine the hypothesis that there are direct relationships between cartilage biomarkers of damage/turnover and clinical, histologic, and molecular markers of inflammation. METHODS: Synovial fluid (SF) and synovial membrane (SM) were obtained by arthroscopy, and a synovitis score was determined, in 32 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (13 with early untreated disease, 19 with established disease), 18 with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 10 with osteoarthritis (OA). Systemic disease activity markers were recorded, and SM CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD68+ macrophages, and lining layer hyperplasia were quantified. SF levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-10 (IL-10), matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), MMP-3, Col2-3/4C(Long mono) neoepitope (C2C) (reflecting collagenase cleavage of cartilage CII), C-propeptide of type II procollagen (PIICP) (a biosynthesis marker), keratan sulfate (KS), and the 846 epitope of aggrecan (turnover) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Levels of cartilage degradation products in early RA or early PsA were not elevated above levels in OA, although in early inflammatory arthritis, TNFalpha and MMP-1 levels were similar to those observed in late inflammatory disease and higher than those in OA. PIICP was reduced in early RA. Correlations were observed between the SF C2C neoepitope level and the Health Assessment Questionnaire score, C-reactive protein level, plasma viscosity, synovitis score, and SF TNFalpha and MMP-1 levels. KS epitope content was reduced in direct relation to SM macrophage infiltration in the sublining and lining layers and in the presence of elevated SF MMP-3. Both SF MMP-1 and SF MMP-3 levels correlated with CD4+ T cell infiltration and lining layer hyperplasia in the SM, and MMP-1 levels correlated with lining layer CD68 levels, but TNFalpha and IL-10 levels did not. CONCLUSION: Except for CII synthesis, there were no significant changes in extracellular matrix turnover of aggrecan or CII in the early stages of human inflammatory arthritis. However, the direct correlation between the increases in TNFalpha and MMP-1 production and collagen degradation suggests that collagenase cleavage of cartilage collagen is related to the activities of TNFalpha and MMP-1. The reduction in CII synthesis in early RA may contribute to the developing pathology, since a lack of synthesis of this molecule would inhibit maintenance of cartilage matrix.

12438517|t|Yohimbine dimers exhibiting selectivity for the human alpha 2C-adrenoceptor subtype.
12438517|a|Yohimbine is a potent and selective alpha2- versus alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist. To date, drugs with high specificity for the alpha2-adrenoceptor show marginal selectivity among the three alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes. Initial studies showed that yohimbine was about 4- and 15-fold more selective for the human alpha2C-adrenoceptor in comparison with the alpha2A- and alpha2B-adrenoceptors, respectively. To improve on this alpha2-adrenoceptor subtype selectivity, a series of yohimbine dimers (varying from n = 2 to 24 spacer atoms) were prepared and evaluated for receptor binding on human alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Each dimeric analog showed higher affinities for alpha2A- and alpha2C-adrenoceptor versus the alpha2B-adrenoceptor; and yohimbine dimers with spacers of n = 2, 3, 4, 18, and 24 exhibited selectivity for the alpha2C-adrenoceptor. The yohimbine dimers n = 3 and n = 24 showed the highest potency and selectivity (32- and 82-fold. respectively) for the alpha2C-adrenoceptor in receptor binding and in functional studies (42- and 29-fold, respectively) measuring cAMP changes using a cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay. The dimers (n = 3 and n = 24) had high selectivity (>1000-fold) for the alpha2C-adrenoceptor compared with the three alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes. These findings demonstrate that the addition of spacer linkages to bivalent yohimbine molecules provides a successful approach to the development of ligands that are potent and highly selective for the alpha2C-adrenoceptor.

23142699|t|Proto-oncogene PIM-1 is a novel estrogen receptor target associating with high grade breast tumors.
23142699|a|We searched ERa cistromes of MCF-7 breast cancer cells for previously unrecognized ERa targets and identified proto-oncogene PIM-1 as a novel potential target gene. We show that the expression of PIM-1 is induced in response to estradiol in MCF-7 cells and that the induction is mediated by ERa-regulated enhancers located distally upstream from the gene. In keeping with the growth-promoting role of the PIM-1, depletion of the PIM-1 attenuated the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells, which was paralleled with up-regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor CDKN1A and CDKN2B expression. Analysis of PIM-1 expression between invasive breast tumors and benign breast tissue samples showed that elevated PIM-1 expression is associated with malignancy and a higher tumor grade. In sum, identification of PIM-1 as an ERa target gene adds a novel potential mechanism by which estrogens can contribute to breast cancer cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.

23410005|t|Synthesis and cancer stem cell-based activity of substituted 5-morpholino-7H-thieno[3,2-b]pyran-7-ones designed as next generation PI3K inhibitors.
23410005|a|Dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in a wide range of tumors has made PI3K a consensus target to inhibit as illustrated by more than 15 inhibitors now in clinical trials. Our previous work, built on the early pioneering multikinase inhibitor LY294002, resulted in the only PI3K vascular-targeted PI3K inhibitor prodrug, SF1126, which has now completed Phase I clinical trials. This inhibitor has properties that impart more in vivo activity than should be warranted by its enzymatic potency, which in general is much lower than other clinical stage PI3K inhibitors. We embarked on the exploration of scaffolds that retained such properties while simultaneously exhibiting an increased potency toward PI3K. This work resulted in the discovery of the 5-morpholino-7H-thieno[3,2-b]pyran-7-one system as the foundation of a new compound class of potential PI3K inhibitors having improved potency toward PI3K. The synthesis and cancer stem cell-based activity of these compounds are reported herein.

23379481|t|Activation of the anti-cancer agent upamostat by the mARC enzyme system.
23379481|a|Abstract 1. Upamostat (MesupronR) is a new small molecule serine protease inhibitor. The drug candidate was developed to inhibit the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) system, which plays a major role in tumor invasion and metastasis. Upamostat is currently in clinical development as an anti-metastatic and non-cytotoxic agent against pancreatic and breast cancer. 2. Upamostat is the orally available amidoxime- (i.e. hydroxyamidine-) prodrug of the pharmacologically active form, WX-UK1. In this study, the reductive enzymatic activation of upamostat to its corresponding amidine WX-UK1 was analyzed. 3. The recently discovered molybdenum enzyme "mitochondrial Amidoxime Reducing Component" (mARC) catalyses together with its electron transport proteins cytochrome b(5) and NADH cytochrome b(5) reductase the reduction of N-hydroxylated prodrugs. In vitro biotransformation assays with porcine subcellular fractions and the reconstituted human enzymes demonstrate an mARC-dependent N-reduction of upamostat.

23511897|t|High density lipoprotein as a source of cholesterol for adrenal steroidogenesis: a study in individuals with low plasma HDL-C.
23511897|a|Few studies have addressed the delivery of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol to the adrenals for steroid production in humans. While there is evidence against a role for low-density lipoprotein (LDL), it is unresolved whether high density lipoprotein (HDL) contributes to adrenal steroidogenesis. To study this, steroid hormone profiles in urine were assessed in male subjects suffering from functional mutations in ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (n = 24), lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (n = 40), as well as in 11 subjects with low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) without ABCA1/LCAT mutations. HDL-C levels were 39% lower in the ABCA1, LCAT, and low HDL-C groups compared with controls (all P < 0.001). In all groups with low HDL-C levels, urinary excretion of 17-ketogenic steroids was reduced by 33%, 27%, and 32% compared with controls (all P < 0.04). In seven carriers of either type of mutation, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation did not reveal differences from normolipidemic controls. In conclusion, this study shows that basal but not stimulated corticosteroid metabolism is attenuated in subjects with low HDL-C, irrespective of its molecular origin. These findings lend support to a role for HDL as a cholesterol donor for basal adrenal steroidogenesis in humans.

8819507|t|Alpha-2 adrenoceptor subtype causing nitric oxide-mediated vascular relaxation in rats.
8819507|a|The alpha-2 adrenoceptor subtype and its signal transduction pathway mediating vascular relaxation in rats were studied in vitro using rings of superior mesenteric arteries. Removal of endothelium or incubation with NG-nitro-L-arginine completely blocked relaxant responses to UK14,304, suggesting endothelium-derived nitric oxide mediates relaxation. The order of potency for full (F) or partial (P) agonists causing relaxation was guanabenz (P) > UK14,304 (F) > clonidine (P) > epinephrine (F) > norepinephrine (F). Affinities (Ka) of alpha-2 adrenoceptor subtype-selective drugs for blocking relaxation were obtained in side-by-side experiments comparing rat mesenteric arteries with pig coronary arteries. Relaxation of pig coronary arteries is known to be mediated by the alpha-2A adrenoceptor subtype. Ka values in nM for rauwolscine (19), WB-4101 (265), SKF-104078 (197), spiroxatrine (128), and prazosin (1531) for blocking relaxation in rat arteries were consistent with their affinities for binding at the alpha-2D adrenoceptor subtype. Ka values for rauwolscine and WB-4101, drugs distinguishing the alpha-2D from the alpha-2A adrenoceptor subtype, were significantly higher in blocking relaxation of rat arteries compared with pig arteries, suggesting the alpha-2D adrenoceptor subtype mediates NO-induced relaxation in rat arteries. We used forskolin to oppose alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation by directly stimulating cAMP formation in endothelium. Forskolin did not affect the relaxant response to UK14,304, suggesting that cAMP is not involved in the coupling of alpha-2 adrenoceptors to nitric oxide-induced vascular relaxation.

22718571|t|Anti-diabetic Activity of Swertiamarin is due to an Active Metabolite, Gentianine, that Upregulates PPAR-g Gene Expression in 3T3-L1 cells.
22718571|a|We have previously shown the anti-diabetic effects of swertiamarin; however, pharmacokinetic analysis showed that swertiamarin had a plasma half-life of 1.3 h. Gentianine is an active metabolite of swertiamarin that possesses a pharmacophoric moiety. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility whether the anti-diabetic effect of swertiamarin is due to gentianine. Swertiamarin treatment had no significant effect on adipogenesis, or the mRNA expression of PPAR-g and GLUT-4; however, there was a significant increase in the mRNA expression of adiponectin. On the other hand, treatment with gentianine significantly increased adipogenesis, which was associated with a significant increase in the mRNA expression of PPAR-g, GLUT-4 and adiponectin. These findings suggest, for the first time, that the anti-diabetic effect of swertiamarin is due to gentianine, an active metabolite of swertiamarin. Copyright    2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

23298863|t|Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of hedgehog inhibitor TAK-441 for the inhibition of Gli1 messenger RNA expression and antitumor efficacy in xenografted tumor model mice.
23298863|a|6-Ethyl-N-[1-(hydroxyacetyl)piperidin-4-yl]-1-methyl-4-oxo-5-(2-oxo-2-phenylethyl)-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine-2-carboxamide (TAK-441) is a potent, selective hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitor that binds to Smo and is being developed for the treatment of cancer. The objectives of these studies were to explore the possibility of establishing of a link between the pharmacokinetics of TAK-441 and the responses of Gli1 mRNA in tumor-associated stromal or skin cells and the antitumor effect of hedgehog inhibition. To this end, we built pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models that describe the relationship of the concentrations of TAK-441 plasma to the responses of Gli1 mRNA in the tumor (target) and skin (surrogate) and to tumor growth inhibition in mice bearing xenografts of human pancreatic tumors (PAN-04). The responses of Gli1 mRNA and tumor growth were described by an indirect response model and an exponential tumor growth model, respectively. The IC50 values for Gli1 mRNA inhibition in the tumor and skin by TAK-441 were estimated to be 0.0457 and 0.113 ug/ml, respectively. The IC90 value for tumor growth inhibition was estimated to be 0.68 ug/ml. These results suggest that a >83% inhibition of Gli1 mRNA expression in the skin or a >94% inhibition of Gli1 mRNA expression in the tumor would be required to sufficiently inhibit (>90%) hedgehog-related tumor growth in the xenografted model mice. We conclude that Gli1 mRNA expression in the tumor and skin could be a useful biomarker for predicting the antitumor effect of hedgehog inhibitors.

17344208|t|Structure and kinetics of monofunctional proline dehydrogenase from Thermus thermophilus.
17344208|a|Proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH) catalyze the two-step oxidation of proline to glutamate. They are distinct monofunctional enzymes in all eukaryotes and some bacteria but are fused into bifunctional enzymes known as proline utilization A (PutA) in other bacteria. Here we report the first structure and biochemical data for a monofunctional PRODH. The 2.0-A resolution structure of Thermus thermophilus PRODH reveals a distorted (betaalpha)(8) barrel catalytic core domain and a hydrophobic alpha-helical domain located above the carboxyl-terminal ends of the strands of the barrel. Although the catalytic core is similar to that of the PutA PRODH domain, the FAD conformation of T. thermophilus PRODH is remarkably different and likely reflects unique requirements for membrane association and communication with P5CDH. Also, the FAD of T. thermophilus PRODH is highly solvent-exposed compared with PutA due to a 4-A shift of helix 8. Structure-based sequence analysis of the PutA/PRODH family led us to identify nine conserved motifs involved in cofactor and substrate recognition. Biochemical studies show that the midpoint potential of the FAD is -75 mV and the kinetic parameters for proline are K(m) = 27 mm and k(cat) = 13 s(-1). 3,4-Dehydro-l-proline was found to be an efficient substrate, and l-tetrahydro-2-furoic acid is a competitive inhibitor (K(I) = 1.0 mm). Finally, we demonstrate that T. thermophilus PRODH reacts with O(2) producing superoxide. This is significant because superoxide production underlies the role of human PRODH in p53-mediated apoptosis, implying commonalities between eukaryotic and bacterial monofunctional PRODHs.

17561836|t|EphB1 null mice exhibit neuronal loss in substantia nigra pars reticulata and spontaneous locomotor hyperactivity.
17561836|a|The molecular mechanisms that regulate basal ganglia development are largely unknown. Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are potential participants in this process as they regulate development of other CNS regions and are expressed in basal ganglia nuclei, such as the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. To address the role of Eph receptors in the development of these nuclei, we analysed anatomical changes in the SN and striatum of mice with null mutations for EphB1. These mice express beta-galactosidase as a marker for cells normally expressing EphB1. In situ hybridization data and a direct comparison of SN neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and/or the beta-gal marker for EphB1 revealed that EphB1 is not expressed in TH+ neurons of pars compacta (SNc), but is restricted to neurons in pars reticulata (SNr). Consistent with this, we find that EphB1 null mice exhibit a significant decrease in the volume and number of neurons (40% decrease) in SNr, whereas the volume and number of TH+ neurons in SNc is not significantly affected nor are there changes in the distribution of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Although EphB1 is expressed in the striatum, EphB1-/- mice exhibit no significant changes in striatal volume and TH fiber density, and have no obvious alterations in striatal patch/matrix organization. Behavioral evaluation of EphB1 null mice in an open-field environment revealed that these mice exhibited spontaneous locomotor hyperactivity. These results suggest that EphB1 is necessary for the proper formation of SNr, and that neuronal loss in SNr is associated with altered locomotor functions.

17205056|t|Antitumor activity of sorafenib in FLT3-driven leukemic cells.
17205056|a|Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) insertions in the juxtamembrane domain of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase are found in about one fourth of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and have been shown to be an independent negative prognostic factor for survival. We show that sorafenib (BAY 43-9006, Nexavar) potently inhibits FLT3 enzymatic and signaling activities. In HEK293 cells stably transfected with FLT3-WT or FLT3-ITD, sorafenib blocked basal and ligand dependent FLT3-mediated tyrosine autophosphorylation as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 and Stat5 phosphorylation. In leukemia cell lines MV4-11 and EOL-1, sorafenib treatment resulted in decreased cell proliferation and inhibition of FLT3 signaling. The growth of the FLT3-independent RS4-11 cell line was only weakly inhibited by sorafenib. Cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis were observed upon treatment with sorafenib in MV4-11 and EOL-1 cells. The antitumor efficacy of sorafenib was evaluated against the MV4-11 leukemia grown subcutaneously in NCr nu/nu mice. Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg administered orally for 14 days resulted in six and nine out of 10 animals with complete responses, respectively. The demonstration that sorafenib exhibits potent target inhibition and efficacy in FLT3-driven models suggests that this compound may have a therapeutic benefit for patients with FLT3-driven leukemias.

23562076|t|Improved Insulin Sensitivity despite Increased Visceral Adiposity in Mice Deficient for the Immune Cell Transcription Factor T-bet.
23562076|a|Low-grade inflammation in fat is associated with insulin resistance, although the mechanisms are unclear. We report that mice deficient in the immune cell transcription factor T-bet have lower energy expenditure and increased visceral fat compared with wild-type mice, yet paradoxically are more insulin sensitive. This striking phenotype, present in young T-bet(-/-) mice, persisted with high-fat diet and increasing host age and was associated with altered immune cell numbers and cytokine secretion specifically in visceral adipose tissue. However, the favorable metabolic phenotype observed in T-bet-deficient hosts was lost in T-bet(-/-) mice also lacking adaptive immunity (T-bet(-/-)xRag2(-/-)), demonstrating that T-bet expression in the adaptive rather than the innate immune system impacts host glucose homeostasis. Indeed, adoptive transfer of T-bet-deficient, but not wild-type, CD4(+) T cells to Rag2(-/-) mice improved insulin sensitivity. Our results reveal a role for T-bet in metabolic physiology and obesity-associated insulin resistance.

23643748|t|Prosocial effects of oxytocin in two mouse models of autism spectrum disorders.
23643748|a|Clinical evidence suggests that oxytocin treatment improves social deficits and repetitive behavior in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the neuropeptide has a short plasma half-life and poor ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. In order to facilitate the development of more bioavailable oxytocinergic compounds as therapeutics to treat core ASD symptoms, small animal models must be validated for preclinical screens. This study examined the preclinical utility of two inbred mouse strains, BALB/cByJ and C58/J, that exhibit phenotypes relevant to core ASD symptoms. Mice from both strains were intraperitoneally administered oxytocin, using either acute or sub-chronic regimens. Acute oxytocin did not increase sociability in BALB/cByJ; however, sub-chronic oxytocin had significant prosocial effects in both BALB/cByJ and C58/J. Increased sociability was observed 24 hours following the final oxytocin dose in BALB/cByJ, while prosocial effects of oxytocin emerged 1-2 weeks post-treatment in C58/J. Furthermore, acute oxytocin decreased motor stereotypy in C58/J and did not induce hypoactivity or anxiolytic-like effects in an open field test. This study demonstrates that oxytocin administration can attenuate social deficits and repetitive behavior in mouse models of ASD, dependent on dose regimen and genotype. These findings provide validation of the BALB/cByJ and C58/J models as useful platforms for screening novel drugs for intervention in ASDs and for elucidating the mechanisms contributing to the prosocial effects of oxytocin.

16893531|t|The effects of norepinephrine transporter inactivation on locomotor activity in mice.
16893531|a|BACKGROUND: Acute administration of different classes of antidepressants can enhance or reduce spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel environment, but the effects of chronic antidepressant treatment on spontaneous locomotor activity in novel and familiar environments are less well characterized. Because norepinephrine is an important regulator of spontaneous locomotor activity, we speculated that norepinephrine transporter blockade contributes to the effects of some antidepressants on spontaneous locomotor activity. METHODS: Antidepressant drugs (reboxetine, desipramine, imipramine, venlafaxine, bupropion) were administered acutely (intraperitoneal) or chronically (via osmotic minipump) to control and norepinephrine transporter knockout mice, and spontaneous locomotor activity in novel or familiar environments was recorded. RESULTS: Acute treatment with most norepinephrine transporter-blocking antidepressants decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel environment, whereas chronic treatment decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in both novel and familiar environments. The exception was bupropion, a dual norepinephrine transporter/dopamine transporter blocker, which tended to increase spontaneous locomotor activity. Coadministration of reboxetine and the dopamine transporter blocker GBR 12909 also increased spontaneous locomotor activity. Norepinephrine transporter knockout mice had low basal spontaneous locomotor activity, which was increased by bupropion, whereas reboxetine had no effect in norepinephrine transporter knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Acute or chronic inactivation of the norepinephrine transporter decreases spontaneous locomotor activity in novel and familiar environments unless coupled with dopamine transporter blockade.

16480505|t|Roles of rifampicin in drug-drug interactions: underlying molecular mechanisms involving the nuclear pregnane X receptor.
16480505|a|Rifampicin, an important drug in the treatment of tuberculosis, is used extensively despite its broad effects on drug-drug interactions, creating serious problems. The clinical importance of such interactions includes autoinduction leading to suboptimal or failed treatment. The concomitantly administered effects of rifampicin on other drugs can result in their altered metabolism or transportation that are metabolised by cytochromes P450 or transported by p-glycoprotein in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. This review paper summarises recent findings with emphases on the molecular mechanisms used to explain these broad drug-drug interactions. In general, rifampicin can act on a pattern: rifampicin activates the nuclear pregnane X receptor that in turn affects cytochromes P450, glucuronosyltransferases and p-glycoprotein activities. This pattern of action may explain many of the rifampicin inducing drug-drug interactions. However, effects through other mechanisms have also been reported and these make any explanation of such drug-drug interactions more complex.

23614730|t|Toxicological impact of inhaled electric mosquito-repellent liquid on the rat: a hematological, cytokine indications, oxidative stress and tumor markers.
23614730|a|Abstract Context: High malaria burden has led to the increased use of insecticides in the tropics and subtropics. This study thus aimed at assessing the hematological effects alteration of pyrethroid insecticide exposure using the experimental animal model. Objective: A commonly available Electric Mosquito-Repellent Liquid pyrethroid insecticide containing prallethrin 1.6% w/w is widely used for mosquito control in Saudi Arabia. The immunotoxic effects after inhalation exposures to the preparation for a continuous period of 24, 48, and 72 h were investigated in rats. Methods and materials: Rats were exposed to prallethrin 1.6% w/w by inhalation for 72 consecutive hours. Total blood count, blood indices of creatine kinase (CK), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (g-GT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factors (TNF)a, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19.9 and carcinoembrionic antigen (CEA) were assayed. Results: The administration of prallethrin 1.6% w/w created significant increased changes in the levels of total WBC, lymphocytes, RBC, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, platelets, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin in rats after 24, 48, and 72 h of continuous inhalation; however, there was a significant reduction in neutrophils at transient reduction in the monocytes after 24 and 48 h to return to normal after 72 h. Significant increases in the levels of CK, g-GT, SOD, NO, MDA, AFP, IL-2, and TNFa were recorded. CA and CEA did not exhibit any change. Conclusions: Continuous inhalation to prallethrin 1.6% insecticides poses toxicity on hematological variables. It is also concluded that pyrethroid group of insecticide may cause hematological, biochemical, cytokine disturbances and possible mutagenic damage to the tissues.

Productive SAR also transferred to the benzotriazepine and spirobenzodiazepine scaffolds, providing a solution to the labile stereocenter at the C3 position. The molecular basis of how compound 27 inhibits mature CA assembly is rationalized using high-resolution structural information. Our understanding of how compound 27 may inhibit immature Gag assembly is also discussed.

23382074|t|A high-confidence interaction map identifies SIRT1 as a mediator of acetylation of USP22 and the SAGA coactivator complex.
23382074|a|Although many functions and targets have been attributed to the histone and protein deacetylase SIRT1, a comprehensive analysis of SIRT1 binding proteins yielding a high-confidence interaction map has not been established. Using a comparative statistical analysis of binding partners, we have assembled a high-confidence SIRT1 interactome. Employing this method, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22), a component of the deubiquitinating module (DUBm) of the SAGA transcriptional coactivating complex, as a SIRT1-interacting partner. We found that this interaction is highly specific, requires the ZnF-UBP domain of USP22, and is disrupted by the inactivating H363Y mutation within SIRT1. Moreover, we show that USP22 is acetylated on multiple lysine residues and that alteration of a single lysine (K129) within the ZnF-UBP domain is sufficient to alter interaction of the DUBm with the core SAGA complex. Furthermore, USP22-mediated recruitment of SIRT1 activity promotes the deacetylation of individual SAGA complex components. Our results indicate an important role of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation in regulating the formation of DUBm subcomplexes within the larger SAGA complex.

9020367|t|Clonal CD8+ and CD52- T cells are induced in responding B cell lymphoma patients treated with Campath-1H (anti-CD52).
9020367|a|Five patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 4 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were treated with the CDR-grafted (rat x human) monoclonal antibody (mAb) Campath-1H (anti-CD52). Tumour regression was noted preferentially in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow but lymph nodes were less affected. Normal blood B and T cells were profoundly reduced in all patients whereas CD16+ NK cells and CD14+ monocytes decreased marginally. In all responding CLL patients CD52-negative T but not B cells appeared during treatment and persisted for several months (4-19+) during unmaintained follow-up. Clonal T cells defined as a predominance of a single T cell receptor (TCR) V gene usage, in one case verified by TCR CDR3 fragment analysis and nucleotide sequencing, emerged within the CD52-/CD8+ cell population during Campath-1H therapy in 2 CLL patients, both achieving a long-lasting remission. The increase in CD8+ T cell expansions (up to 23-fold) during unmaintained remission and follow-up suggest that the clonal CD8+ cells may represent regulatory T cells controlling the growth of the tumour B cell clone. Clonal T cells might thus be a target for an immune therapeutic intervention in B cell tumours.

23419036|t|Charge screening between anionic and cationic surfactants in ionic liquids.
23419036|a|The aggregation and interfacial behavior of mixtures of anionic (sodium dodecylsulfate, SDS) and cationic (dodecylammonium bromide, DTAB) surfactants were investigated. A room-temperature ionic liquid (IL) was explored as a solvent for the SDS/DTAB system and compared to water. The critical micelle concentration (cmc) and composition in mixed micelles were determined for both solvents. Our experiments showed nearly ideal mixing of SDS/DTAB over the entire composition range and suggest that charge screening is prominent in ILs. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the strong electrostatic attraction and a multiphase composition gap in water. Two models by Clint and Rubingh, which describe ideal and nonideal micellar behavior, respectively, are discussed on the basis of our results. According to Rubingh's model, the composition of mixed micelles is gradually changing with the bulk composition in ILs but tends to be a 1:1 ratio in water. The results here are further support of the strong charge screening in ionic liquids.

20615127|t|Resistance to thyroid hormone due to a novel thyroid hormone receptor mutant in a patient with hypothyroidism secondary to lingual thyroid and functional characterization of the mutant receptor.
20615127|a|BACKGROUND: We describe a rare case of congenital hypothyroidism and an extremely high serum thyrotropin (TSH) level caused by a combination of resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) and a lingual thyroid. As the RTH mutant, R316C, was new, the optimum dose of levothyroxine was unclear. To aid in assessment of the therapy, we characterized the mutant R316C thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and compared it with a common mutant, R316H, using in vitro studies. SUMMARY: The patient was a newborn female having severe hypothyroidism with a free thyroxine level of 0.36 ng/dL and a serum TSH level of 177 microU/mL. A scintiscan showed ectopic lingual thyroid tissue without a normal thyroid gland. Supplementation with levothyroxine at a dose of >350 microg/day did not normalize the serum TSH level; however, the patient showed normal growth and intelligence at 14 years of age. Consistent with the results of a computer analysis, the binding of R316C to triiodothyronine (T3) was significantly decreased to 38% that of the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that like R316H, R316C did not form a homodimer, but formed a heterodimer with RXR. However, a glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay showed reduced binding of R316C with NCoR in the absence of T3 and impaired release in the presence of T3. In addition, transient transfection experiments demonstrated that unlike R316H, R316C had severe impairment of transcriptional activity on genes both positively and negatively regulated by thyroid hormone. It also had a clear dominant negative effect on genes negatively, but not positively, regulated by thyroid hormone, including the TSH-releasing hormone and TSHbeta genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of a R316C TR mutation. The characteristics of the R316C mutant differed from those of the R316H mutant. Our findings suggest that R316C causes reduced association with and impaired release of NCoR, resulting in RTH predominantly at the pituitary level, and that slightly elevated serum TSH level with high dose of levothyroxine might be optimum for normal growth.

16213084|t|Functional characteristics of H+ -dependent nicotinate transport in primary cultures of astrocytes from rat cerebral cortex.
16213084|a|In the present study, we report the characteristics of H(+)-coupled nicotinate transport in primary cultures of astrocytes from rat cerebral cortex. The [(3)H]nicotinate transport in rat astrocytes increased up to a pH 5.5. The nicotinic acid uptake at pH 6.0 was both energy-dependent and saturable with a Michaelis constant (K(t)) of 2.8+/-0.4 mM and the maximal uptake rate (V(max)) of 31+/-3.2 nmol/mg protein/10 min. This process was reduced by a protonophore, carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and a typical monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) inhibitor, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, suggesting that nicotinate uptake by rat astrocytes is mediated by H(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transport system. [(3)H]Nicotinate transport in rat astrocytes was significantly inhibited by various monocarboxylic acids such as l-lactic acid and pyruvic acid with a relatively low affinity (K(i)>10 mM). On the other hand, the uptake process of l-lactic acid was also saturable with a high-affinity component (K(t)=0.27 mM) and a low-affinity component (K(t)=35.9 mM). Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed that three MCT subtypes, MCT1/Slc16a1, MCT2/Slc16a7, and MCT4/Slc16a3, were expressed in these cells. Because l-lactate reduced to 67% of the nicotinate uptake even at 10mM, it is unlikely that nicotinate uptake in rat astrocytes is mediated by MCT1 and/or MCT2. These results provide biochemical evidence of a H(+)-coupled and saturable transport system, presumed to be a low-affinity monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 or other unknown H(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transport system, for nicotinate in rat cerebrocortical astrocytes.

17148442|t|Ankyrin repeat and suppressors of cytokine signaling box protein asb-9 targets creatine kinase B for degradation.
17148442|a|The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins inhibit cytokine action by direct interaction with Janus kinases or activated cytokine receptors. In addition to the N-terminal and Src homology 2 domains that mediate these interactions, SOCS proteins contain a C-terminal SOCS box. DNA data base searches have identified a number of other protein families that possess a SOCS box, of which the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing (Asb) proteins constitute the largest. Although it is known that the SOCS proteins are involved in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling, the biological and biochemical functions of the Asbs are largely undefined. Using a proteomics approach, we demonstrate that creatine kinase B (CKB) interacts with Asb-9 in a specific, SOCS box-independent manner. This interaction increases the polyubiquitylation of CKB and decreases total CKB levels within the cell. The targeting of CKB for degradation by Asb-9 was primarily SOCS box-dependent and suggests that Asb-9 acts as a specific ubiquitin ligase regulating levels of this evolutionarily conserved enzyme.

23639362|t|Cyperi Rhizoma inhibits the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced reduction in nigrostriatal dopaminergenic neurons in estrogen-deprived mice.
23639362|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cyperi Rhizoma has commonly been used for the treatment of gynecological and neuropsychiatric disorders in traditional medicine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the estrogenic properties and neuroprotective effects of Cyperi Rhizoma under estrogen-deprived condition in female mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the estrogen-like effect of Cyperi Rhizoma extract (CRE), we measured luciferase expression after transfection of a promoter construct containing an estrogen response element (ERE) and treatment of CRE. To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of CRE, we measured striatal dopamine, movement ability, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, and apoptosis-related protein expression levels after treatment of CRE either with or without 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in ovariectomized female mice. RESULTS: CRE significantly induced the luciferase expression driven by an ERE in PC12 cells, a dopaminergic cell line, in a dose-dependent manner. In mice, MPTP significantly decreased the levels of dopamine in the striatum and behavior performance; in contrast, both CRE and 17b-estradiol benzoate (EB) recovered these parameters to normal levels. CRE and EB treatment also recovered TH immunopositive fibers and cells, respectively, from MPTP toxicity. Additionally, MPTP significantly down-regulated Bcl-2 expression in the mitochondria of dopaminergic cells in the SN, followed by an increase in Bax expression, cytochrome C translocation to the cytosol, andcleaved-caspase-3 expression, whereas these were inhibited by CRE or EB treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first evidence that CRE has estrogen-like and neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons in estrogen-deprived mice treated with MPTP-toxin.

15939622|t|COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition in horse blood by phenylbutazone, flunixin, carprofen and meloxicam: an in vitro analysis.
15939622|a|We report on the inhibitory activity of the NSAIDs meloxicam, carprofen, phenylbutazone and flunixin, on blood cyclooxygenases in the horse using in vitro enzyme-linked assays. As expected, comparison of IC50 indicated that meloxicam and carprofen are more selective inhibitors of COX-2 than phenylbutazone and flunixin; meloxicam was the most advantageous for horses of four NSAIDs examined. However at IC80, phenylbutazone (+134.4%) and flunixin (+29.7%) had greater COX-2 selectivity than at IC50, and meloxicam (-41.2%) and carprofen (-12.9%) had lower COX-2 selectivity than at IC50. We therefore propose that the selectivity of NSAIDs should be assessed at the 80% as well as 50% inhibition level.

23584358|t|Agomelatine: An antidepressant with new potent hepatoprotective effects on paracetamol-induced liver damage in rats.
23584358|a|Paracetamol was shown to induce hepatotoxicity or more severe fatal acute hepatic damage. Agomelatine, commonly known as melatonin receptor agonist, is a new antidepressant, which resynchronizes circadian rhythms with subjective and objective improvements in sleep quality and architecture, as melatonin does. In the present study, it was aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective activity of agomelatine on paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity and to understand the relationship between the hepatoprotective mechanism of agomelatine and antioxidant system and proinflammatory cytokines. A total of 42 rats were divided into 7 groups as each composed of 6 rats: (1) intact, (2) 40 mg/kg agomelatine, (3) 140 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine (NAC), (4) 2 g/kg paracetamol, (5) 2 g/kg paracetamol + 140 mg/kg NAC, (6) 2 g/kg paracetamol + 20 mg/kg agomelatine, and (7) 2 g/kg paracetamol + 40 mg/kg agomelatine groups. Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity was applied and liver and blood samples were analyzed histopathologically and biochemically. There were statistically significant increases in the activities of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 8-iso-prostane, and decreases in the activity of superoxide dismutase and level of glutathione in the group treated with paracetamol. Administration of agomelatine and NAC separately reversed these changes significantly. In conclusion, agomelatine administration protects liver cells from paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity via antioxidant activity and reduced proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-6.

22288603|t|Allelopathic activity studies of Mikania scandens.
22288603|a|Preliminary investigation of a number of plant extracts for allelopathic activity using seed germination inhibition bioassay showed a promising activity of the water extract of the aerial parts of Mikania scandens. Activity-guided fractionation of the M. scandens extract led to the isolation of the highly allelopathic active compound mikanolide, with minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.083 uM mL(-1). As M. scandens is a highly abundant invasive plant in Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries, this plant could be developed as an environment friendly natural herbicide, either in crude form as shredded plant material or as pure mikanolide, which is the major constituent ( 0.02%) in the plant.

17768678|t|Phenelzine causes an increase in brain ornithine that is prevented by prior monoamine oxidase inhibition.
17768678|a|Phenelzine (PLZ), a nonselective irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), also inhibits GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), markedly increasing brain GABA levels. PLZ is also a substrate for MAO, and studies suggest that a metabolite formed by the action of this enzyme on PLZ may be responsible for the increase in GABA observed. We have recently found that PLZ also elevates brain ornithine (ORN), an amino acid precursor to both glutamate (and GABA) and the polyamines, and have conducted dose- and time-response studies on this effect. Rats were treated with vehicle or PLZ doses (7.5, 15 or 30 mg/kg i.p.), and brains were collected 3 h later. In the time-response study, animals were treated with vehicle or PLZ (15 mg/kg i.p.) and brains were collected 1-24 h later. To determine whether a metabolite formed by the action of MAO on PLZ may be responsible for the elevation in brain ORN observed, animals were pretreated with vehicle or the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine (TCP) before vehicle or PLZ (15 mg/kg), and brains collected 3 h later. ORN levels (measured by an HPLC procedure) were dose- and time-dependently increased in PLZ-treated animals, with levels reaching approximately 650% of control at 6 and 12 h. Pretreatment with TCP completely abolished the PLZ-induced increase in brain ORN, suggesting, as with GABA, that a metabolite of PLZ formed by the action of MAO is responsible for the elevation of brain ORN observed. The possible contribution of increased ORN to therapeutic and/or neuroprotective properties of PLZ is discussed.

23412396|t|Repeated Low Dose Administration of the Monoacylglycerol Lipase Inhibitor JZL184 Retains CB1 Receptor Mediated Antinociceptive and Gastroprotective Effects.
23412396|a|The monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor JZL184 produces antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects. However, repeated administration of high dose JZL184 (40 mg/kg) causes dependence, antinociceptive tolerance, cross-tolerance to the pharmacological effects of cannabinoid receptor agonists, and CB(1) receptor downregulation and desensitization. This functional CB(1) receptor tolerance poses a hurdle in the development of MAGL inhibitors for therapeutic use. Consequently, the present study tested whether repeated administration of low dose JZL184 maintains its antinociceptive actions in the chronic constrictive injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve neuropathic pain model and protective effects in a model of NSAlD-induced gastric hemorrhages. Mice given daily injections of high dose JZL184 (>16 mg/kg) for six days displayed decreased CB(1) receptor density and function in brain, as assessed in [(3)H]SR141716A binding and CP55,940-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgS binding assays, respectively. In contrast, normal CB(1) receptor expression and function were maintained following repeated administration of low dose JZL184 (<8 mg/kg). Likewise, the antinociceptive and gastroprotective effects of high dose JZL184 underwent tolerance following repeated administration, but these effects were maintained following repeated low dose JZL184 treatment. Consistent with these observations, repeated high dose JZL184, but not repeated low dose JZL184, elicited cross-tolerance to the common pharmacological effects of D(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This same pattern of effects was found in a rimonabant-precipitated withdrawal model of cannabinoid dependence. Taken together, these results indicate that prolonged, partial MAGL inhibition maintains potentially beneficial antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects, without producing functional CB(1) receptor tachyphylaxsis/tolerance or cannabinoid dependence.

15985706|t|Gastric mucin secretion in response to beta-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptor activation is mediated by SRC kinase-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation.
15985706|a|In many systems, the integration of converging regulatory signals that relay on G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation into functional cellular pathways requires the involvement of receptor tyrosine kinase. In this report, we provide evidence that activation of GPCR by beta-adrenergic agonist leading to stimulation in gastric mucin secretion requires epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) participation. Using [(3)H]glucosamine-labeled gastric mucosal cells, we show that stimulatory effect of beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, on mucin secretion was inhibited by EGFR kinase inhibitor, PD153035, as well as wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K. Both inhibitors, moreover, blunted the mucin secretory responses to beta-adrenergic agonist-generated second messenger, cAMP as well as adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin. The gastric mucin secretory responses to isoproterenol, furthermore, were inhibited by PP2, a selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinase Src responsible for ligand-independent EGFR autophosphorylation, but not by ERK inhibitor, PD98059. The inhibition of ERK, moreover, did not cause attenuation in mucin secretion in response to cAMP and forskolin. The findings underline the role of EGFR as a convergence point in gastric mucin secretion triggered by beta-adrenergic GPCR activation, and demonstrate the requirement for Src kinase in EGFR transactivation.

9399012|t|Pre-clinical pharmacology of zolmitriptan (Zomig; formerly 311C90), a centrally and peripherally acting 5HT1B/1D agonist for migraine.
9399012|a|Zolmitriptan (Zomig; formerly 311C90) is a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)1B/1D receptor agonist with proven efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine with or without preceding aura. The drug differs from presently available members of this drug class in that it combines 5HT1B/1D receptor partial agonist activity with robust oral pharmacokinetics and an ability to inhibit trigeminovascular activation centrally as well as peripherally in preclinical studies. Consistent with its selectivity for 5HT1B/1D receptors, zolmitriptan produces constriction of various isolated blood vessels, most notably cranial arteries. In anaesthetized animals, these vascular effects manifest as a selective constriction of cranial arterio-venous anastomoses resulting in a redistribution of carotid arterial blood flow. This effect is produced without significant effects on heart rate, blood pressure or blood flow to the brain, heart or lungs. Zolmitriptan also inhibits trigeminal-evoked increases in cerebral blood flow in anaesthetized cats and blocks trigeminal-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the dura of guinea-pigs. These actions are consistent with a pre-junctional inhibition of neuropeptide release from perivascular afferents of the trigeminal nerve, as confirmed by independent studies showing that zolmitriptan blocks elevations of calcitonin-gene-related peptide in jugular venous blood during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. In all of these effects, zolmitriptan is three to four times more potent than sumatriptan, but produces the same maximum response. Zolmitriptan crosses the intact blood-brain barrier to inhibit trigeminovascular activation in the brainstem. This was shown initially by the ability of the drug to block a brainstem reflex provoking vasoactive intestinal peptide release from the VIIth cranial (facial) nerve during trigeminal stimulation. Subsequent ex vivo autoradiography confirmed that intravenously injected [3H]zolmitriptan labels a discrete population of cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and nucleus tractus solitarius. Direct evidence for a central neuromodulatory effect of zolmitriptan was provided by electrophysiological experiments which clearly demonstrated that the drug inhibits the excitability of cells in the TNC after systemic administration. This novel pre-clinical profile not only distinguishes zolmitriptan from sumatriptan, but raises intriguing questions about the clinical relevance of a dual action. Studies to date show that zolmitriptan indeed modulates cranial sensory processing in humans, yet central side-effects are no different from sumatriptan. This property may account for the remarkable consistency in clinical efficacy observed in clinical trials.

23159529|t|Nanobody-albumin nanoparticles (NANAPs) for the delivery of a multikinase inhibitor 17864 to EGFR overexpressing tumor cells.
23159529|a|A novel, EGFR-targeted nanomedicine has been developed in the current study. Glutaraldehyde crosslinked albumin nanoparticles with a size of approximately 100nm were loaded with the multikinase inhibitor 17864-L(x)-a platinum-bound sunitinib analogue-which couples the drug to methionine residues of albumin and is released in a reductive environment. Albumin nanoparticles were surface-coated with bifunctional polyethylene glycol 3500 (PEG) and a nanobody-the single variable domain of an antibody-(Ega1) against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGa1-PEG functionalized nanoparticles showed a 40-fold higher binding to EGFR-positive 14C squamous head and neck cancer cells in comparison to PEGylated nanoparticles. 17864-L(x) loaded EGa1-PEG nanoparticles were internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and ultimately digested in lysosomes. The intracellular routing of EGa1 targeted nanoparticles leads to a successful release of the kinase inhibitor in the cell and inhibition of proliferation whereas the non-targeted formulations had no antiproliferative effects on 14C cells. The drug loaded targeted nanoparticles were as effective as the free drug in vitro. These results demonstrate that multikinase inhibitor loaded nanoparticles are interesting nanomedicines for the treatment of EGFR-positive cancers.

23298677|t|Induction of HO-1 through p38 MAPK/Nrf2 signaling pathway by ethanol extract of Inula helenium L. reduces inflammation in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells and CLP-induced septic mice.
23298677|a|High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) plays a crucial mediator in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases. We recently proposed that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) negatively regulates HMGB1 in inflammatory conditions. We investigated whether ethanol extract of Inula helenium L. (EIH) activates p38 MAPK/Nrf2/HO-1 pathways in RAW264.7 cells and reduces inflammation in CLP-induced septic mice. EIH induced expression of HO-1 protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. EIH significantly diminished HO-1 expression in siNrf2 RNA-transfected cells. As expected, the inhibited expression of iNOS/NO, COX-2/PGE2, HMGB1 release by EIH in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells was significantly reversed by siHO-1RNA transfection. Furthermore, EIH not only inhibited NF-kB luciferase activity, phosphorylation of IkBa in LPS-activated cells but also significantly suppressed expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) in TNF-a activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The induction of HO-1 by EIH was inhibited by SB203580 but not by SP600125, PD98059, nor LY294002. Most importantly, administration of EIH significantly reduced not only increase in blood HMGB1, ALT, AST, BUN, creatinine levels but also decrease macrophage infiltrate in the liver of septic mice, which were reversed by ZnPPIX, a HO-1 inhibitor. We concluded that EIH has anti-inflammatory effect via the induction of p38 MAPK-dependent HO-1 signaling pathway.

11309392|t|Nuclear diacylglycerol kinase-theta is activated in response to alpha-thrombin.
11309392|a|Currently, there is substantial evidence that nuclear lipid metabolism plays a critical role in a number of signal transduction cascades. Previous work from our laboratory showed that stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts with alpha-thrombin leads to the production of two lipid second messengers in the nucleus: an increase in nuclear diacylglycerol mass and an activation of phospholipase D, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid. Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) catalyzes the conversion of diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, making it an attractive candidate for a signal transduction component. There is substantial evidence that this activity is indeed regulated in a number of signaling cascades (reviewed by van Blitterswijk, W. J., and Houssa, B. (1999) Chem. Phys. Lipids 98, 95-108). In this report, we show that the addition of alpha-thrombin to quiescent IIC9 fibroblasts results in an increase in nuclear DGK activity. The examination of nuclei isolated from quiescent IIC9 cells indicates that DGK-theta and DGK-delta are both present. We took advantage of the previous observations that phosphatidylserine inhibits DGK-delta (reviewed by Sakane, F., Imai, S., Kai, M., Wada, I., and Kanoh, H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 8394-8401), and constitutively active RhoA inhibits DGK-theta (reviewed by Houssa, B., de Widt, J., Kranenburg, O., Moolenaar, W. H., and van Blitterswijk, W. J. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 6820-6822) to identify the activity induced by alpha-thrombin. Constitutively active RhoA inhibited the nuclear stimulated activity, whereas phosphatidylserine did not have an inhibitory effect. In addition, a monoclonal anti-DGK-theta antibody inhibited the alpha-thrombin-stimulated nuclear activity in vitro. These results demonstrate that DGK-theta is the isoform responsive to alpha-thrombin stimulation. Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses showed that alpha-thrombin induced the translocation of DGK-theta to the nucleus, implicating that this translocation is at least partly responsible for the increased nuclear activity. Taken together, these data are the first to demonstrate an agonist-induced activity of nuclear DGK-theta activity and a nuclear localization of DGK-delta.

15946589|t|Imatinib resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
15946589|a|Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs are ineffective in treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Imatinib (STI571, Gleevec, Glivec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ), a selective inhibitor of KIT, ABL, BCR-ABL, PDGFRA, and PDGFRB, represents a new paradigm of targeted cancer therapy and has revolutionized the treatment of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and GISTs. Unfortunately, imatinib resistance has emerged. The reported mechanism of imatinib resistance in GISTs involves missense mutation in the kinase domain of KIT, including Thr670Ile, Tyr823Asp, and Val654Ala. The established mechanisms and potential mechanisms of imatinib resistance in GISTs, the imaging studies indicative of early development of imatinib resistance, and the management of imatinib-resistant GISTs are discussed.

2568748|t|Nonthrombolytic intervention in acute myocardial infarction.
2568748|a|Alternative interventions are available for patients in whom thrombolytic therapy is inappropriate after an acute myocardial infarction. Administration of a beta blocker within the first 24 hours of the patient's admission to the coronary care unit can reduce overall morbidity and mortality within the first 7 days by about 15%. Maintenance therapy with an oral beta blocker can reduce mortality within the succeeding 3 years by about 25%. Esmolol, a unique cardioselective beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocker with a half-life of 9 minutes, can enable some patients with relative contraindications to beta blockers to nevertheless benefit from early beta-blocking therapy. It also is useful in screening patients for subsequent therapy with beta blockers. Those who tolerate the esmolol infusion can be given a long-acting beta blocker. For patients who exhibit intolerance to esmolol, the infusion can be terminated with rapid return to baseline hemodynamics.

14984733|t|Externalization of phosphatidylserine during apoptosis does not specifically require either isoform of phosphatidylserine synthase.
14984733|a|Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is made in mammalian cells by two PtdSer synthases, PSS1 and PSS2. In the plasma membrane PtdSer is normally localized on the inner leaflet but undergoes transbilayer movement during apoptosis and becomes exposed on the cell surface. We induced apoptosis with staurosporine in four Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that are deficient in PSS1 and/or PSS2 to determine if PtdSer generated by either of these enzymes is required for externalization on the cell surface during apoptosis. The onset of apoptosis was confirmed by the appearance of morphological changes and DNA fragmentation while the plasma membrane remained largely intact. In all cell lines, regardless of their content of PSS1 and/or PSS2, apoptosis occurred to approximately the same extent, and within approximately the same time frame, as in parental CHO-K1 cells. The exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface was assessed by annexin V labeling and flow cytometry. Cells that were deficient in either PSS1 or PSS2, as well as cells that were deficient in both PSS1 and PSS2, externalized normal amounts of PtdSer. Our study demonstrates, that reduction of in vitro serine-exchange activity, even by 97%, does not restrict the externalization of PtdSer during apoptosis. Moreover, a normal level of expression of PSS1 and/or PSS2 is not required for generating the pool of PtdSer externalized during apoptosis.

23221600|t|Human stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) gene expression is negatively regulated by thyroid hormone without direct binding of thyroid hormone receptor to the gene promoter.
23221600|a|Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) plays a pivotal role in an increase of triglyceride by an excess of dietary carbohydrate intake. Dietary carbohydrates increase SCD-1 gene expression in liver by sterol response element binding protein (SREBP)-1c-dependent and SREBP-1c -independent pathways. Previous report demonstrated that thyroid hormone (TH) negatively regulates mouse SCD-1 gene promoter before SREBP-1c was revealed. We reported that TH negatively regulates SREBP-1c recently. Therefore, in the current study, we examined whether and how TH regulates human SCD-1 gene expression and evaluated SREBP-1c effect on the negative regulation. Luciferase assays revealed that TH suppresses both mouse and human SCD-1 gene promoter activity. In SREBP-1 knockdown HepG2 cells, TH still suppresses SCD-1 gene promoter activity, and it also exerted the negative regulation under cotransfection of a small amount of SREBP-1c. These data indicated that SREBP-1c does not play the decisive role for the negative regulation by TH. The responsible region for the negative regulation in human SCD-1 gene promoter turned out to be between -124 and -92 bp, referred to as site A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TH receptor-b is recruited to the region upon T(3) administration, although TR-b does not bind directly to site A. In conclusion, TH negatively regulates human SCD-1 gene expression in without direct binding of the TH receptor to the SCD-1 gene promoter.

15075397|t|ATR regulates a G2-phase cell-cycle checkpoint in Arabidopsis thaliana.
15075397|a|Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) plays a central role in cell-cycle regulation, transmitting DNA damage signals to downstream effectors of cell-cycle progression. In animals, ATR is an essential gene. Here, we find that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) atr-/- mutants were viable, fertile, and phenotypically wild-type in the absence of exogenous DNA damaging agents but exhibit altered expression of AtRNR1 (ribonucleotide reductase large subunit) and alteration of some damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoints. atr mutants were hypersensitive to hydroxyurea (HU), aphidicolin, and UV-B light but only mildly sensitive to gamma-radiation. G2 arrest was observed in response to gamma-irradiation in both wild-type and atr plants, albeit with slightly different kinetics, suggesting that ATR plays a secondary role in response to double-strand breaks. G2 arrest also was observed in wild-type plants in response to aphidicolin but was defective in atr mutants, resulting in compaction of nuclei and subsequent cell death. By contrast, HU-treated wild-type and atr plants arrested in G1 and showed no obvious signs of cell death. We propose that, in plants, HU invokes a novel checkpoint responsive to low levels of deoxynucleotide triphosphates. These results demonstrate the important role of cell-cycle checkpoints in the ability of plant cells to sense and cope with problems associated with DNA replication.

17094978|t|Mifepristone alters expression of endometrial steroid receptors and their cofactors in new users of medroxyprogesterone acetate.
17094978|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of mifepristone on the expression of endometrial steroid receptors and their co-factors in depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) users. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Reproductive research center. PATIENT(S): Fifty healthy women with regular menstrual cycle. INTERVENTION(S): One hundred fifty milligrams of DMPA were given every 3 months. Two pills (25 mg each) of placebo or mifepristone were administered every 14 days during the DMPA therapy. Four endometrial biopsy specimens were obtained from each patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The expression of estrogen receptor subtypes alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta), progesterone receptors A and B (PRAB and PRB), and androgen receptor messenger RNA and protein was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1), silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid-hormone receptors, and cell proliferation were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULT(S): The expression of endometrial ERalpha, PRAB, PRB, and SRC-1 was increased significantly after 1 week of mifepristone, but the increase was no longer seen after 10 weeks. A positive correlation between endometrial ERalpha, PRAB, PRB, and SRC-1 production and proliferation was demonstrated. CONCLUSION(S): Short-term exposure of mifepristone in new starters of DMPA increases the expression of endometrial ERalpha, PRAB, PRB, and SRC-1 and promotes cell proliferation. Prolonged exposure to mifepristone does not alter the suppression of these receptors that are caused by DMPA and continues to result in endometrial atrophy.

17496727|t|A novel variant L263F in human inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 is associated with diminished enzyme activity.
17496727|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 is required for purine synthesis in activated lymphocytes. Variants in the IMPDH2 gene may account for the large inter-individual variability in baseline enzyme activity, immunosuppressive efficacy and side effects in transplant recipients receiving mycophenolic acid. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify and functionally characterize IMPDH2 variants. METHODS: DNA samples from 152 solid organ transplant patients were screened at exons and exon/intron junctions of the IMPDH2 genes by PCR amplification followed by bidirectional direct DNA sequencing. Genetic variant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and transformed to an inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase-deficient strain of Escherichia coli h712. Proteins were purified to homogeneity and the enzymatic activity was measured by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide production. RESULTS: Nine genetic variants were identified in the IMPDH2 gene, with frequencies of the rarer alleles ranging from 0.5 to 10.2%. A novel nonsynonymous variant L263F was identified, and the kinetic assay demonstrated that the inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity of L263F variant was decreased to 10% of the wild-type. The Ki for mycophenolic acid inhibition of the L263F variant was comparable with the wild-type, and the variant Km for inosine 5'-monophosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide did not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: IMPDH2 has low genetic diversity, but the nonsynonymous variant L263F has a significant impact on inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity. This novel functional variant may be one of the factors contributing to the inter-individual difference of baseline inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity as well as drug efficacy and adverse events in transplant patients.

23333261|t|Contribution of single-minded 2 to hyperglycaemia-induced neurotoxicity.
23333261|a|Diabetes mellitus is associated to central nervous system damage, which results in impairment of brain functions and cognitive deficits and decline in memory. However, the mechanisms mediating the actions of glucose on the neurons remained elusive. Single-minded 2 (Sim2), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS transcriptional repressor, is thought to be involved in some symptoms of Down syndrome. We hypothesized that Sim2 mediated hyperglycaemia-induced neuronal injury and impairment of learning and memory. It was found that expression of Sim2 protein in cortical neurons was increased in streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus rat model. Drebrin, down-regulated by Sim2, was subsequently decreased as detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy and Western blot analysis. The expression pattern of Sim2 and Drebrin correspond to 50mmol/L glucose (hyperglycaemia) was also found in primary cultured neurons. Curcumin, one neuroprotective agent, inhibited hyperglycaemia-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, curcumin alleviated Sim2 expression, and reversely raised Drebrin expression in neurons treated with hyperglycaemia. Finally, we found that silencing Sim2 expression decreased hyperglycaemia-induced neuronal injury. In conclusion, Sim2 may mediate neurotoxicity during hyperglycaemia and thereby play a critical role in the development of hyperglycaemia-induced cognitive deficits.

23391336|t|Cloning, Characterization, and Sulfonamide and Thiol Inhibition Studies of an a-Carbonic Anhydrase from Trypanosoma cruzi, the Causative Agent of Chagas Disease.
23391336|a|An a-carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) has been identified, cloned, and characterized from the unicellular protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The enzyme (TcCA) has a very high catalytic activity for the CO(2) hydration reaction, being similar kinetically to the human (h) isoform hCA II, although it is devoid of the His64 proton shuttle. A large number of aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides and some 5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazoles were investigated as TcCA inhibitors. The aromatic sulfonamides were weak inhibitors (K(I) values of 192 nM to 84 uM), whereas some heterocyclic compounds inhibited the enzyme with K(I) values in the range 61.6-93.6 nM. The thiols were the most potent in vitro inhibitors (K(I) values of 21.1-79.0 nM), and some of them also inhibited the epimastigotes growth of two T. cruzi strains in vivo.

23017388|t|SB365, Pulsatilla saponin D suppresses the proliferation of human colon cancer cells and induces apoptosis by modulating the AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.
23017388|a|Pulsatilla koreana has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of several diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine if SB365, Pulsatilla saponin D isolated from the root of P. koreana inhibits the progression of colon cancer. We found that SB365 strongly suppressed the growth and proliferation of colon cancer cells and induced their apoptosis. Also, SB365 showed anti-angiogenic activity by decreasing the expression of HIF-1a and VEGF. These results were confirmed by an in vivo study showing that SB365 significantly inhibited tumor growth by the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis with stronger anticancer activity than 5-FU. When further examined for its anticancer mechanism, SB365 effectively suppressed the AKT/mTOR pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our study demonstrated that SB365 inhibits the AKT/mTOR pathway, leading to the suppression of tumor growth and angiogenesis together with induction of apoptosis. Therefore, SB365 is a good candidate as a natural product for use in the treatment of colon cancer.

20053189|t|Abarelix and other gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists in prostate cancer.
20053189|a|Hormonal therapy is the main recommended treatment for locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, such as buserelin, goserelin, leuprorelin and triptorelin, stimulate the pituitary's gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor, ultimately leading to its de-sensitization and subsequent reduction of LH and testosterone levels. However, this reduction is accompanied by a well described increase or 'surge' in LH and testosterone levels, necessitating the concomitant administration of an antiandrogen to combat the potential effects of transient acceleration in cancer activity. Two pure GnRH antagonists have been developed, abarelix and degarelix, that are devoid of any agonist effect on the GnRH receptor and consequently do not result in testosterone flare. Abarelix was the first GnRH antagonist to be developed and was approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration in 2004 for the initiation of hormonal castration in advanced or metastasizing hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma, when rapid androgen suppression is necessary. Clinical data on both abarelix and degarelix show that they can produce rapid and sustained decreases in testosterone to castrate levels without the need for co-administration of an antiandrogen, and with a very low complication rate in the short term.

23511088|t|Derivatives of Dictyostelium discoideum differentiation-inducing factor-3 suppress the activities of Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro and in vivo.
23511088|a|Chagas disease (human American trypanosomiasis), which is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is responsible for numerous deaths each year; however, established treatments for the disease are limited. Differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1) and DIF-3 are chlorinated alkylphenones originally found in the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum that have been shown to possess pharmacological activities. Here, we investigated the effects of DIF-3 derivatives on the infection rate and growth of T. cruzi by using an in vitro assay system utilizing host human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. Certain DIF-3 derivatives, such as butoxy-DIF-3 (Bu-DIF-3), at micro-molar levels strongly suppressed both the infection rate and growth of T. cruzi in HT1080 cells and exhibited little toxicity for HT1080 cells. For example, the IC50 of DIF-3 and Bu-DIF-3 versus the growth of T. cruzi in HT1080 cells were 3.95 and 0.72uM, respectively, and the LD50 of the two compounds versus HT1080 cells were both greater than 100uM. We also examined the effects of DIF-3 and Bu-DIF-3 on T. cruzi activity in C57BL/6 mice. Intraperitoneally administered Bu-DIF-3 (50mg/kg) significantly suppressed the number of trypomastigotes in blood with no apparent adverse effects. These results strongly suggest that DIF-3 derivatives could be new lead compounds in the development of anti-trypanosomiasis drugs.

17154506|a|2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(3'-((Z)-2-iodoethenyl)phenyl)nortropane (mZIENT, 1) and 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(3'-((Z)-2-bromoethenyl)phenyl)nortropane (mZBrENT, 2) were synthesized and evaluated for binding to the human serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine transporters (SERT, DAT, and NET, respectively) using transfected cells. Both 1 and 2 have a high affinity for the SERT (Ki=0.2 nM) and are approximately 160 times more selective for the SERT than the DAT. Compound 2 has a significantly higher affinity for the NET than 1, and this may be a result of the different size and electronegativity of the halogen atoms. MicroPET imaging in nonhuman primates with [11C]1 and [11C]2 demonstrated that both tracers behave similarly in vivo with high uptake being observed in the SERT-rich brain regions and peak uptake being achieved in about 55 min postinjection. Chase studies with citalopram and methylphenidate demonstrated that this uptake is the result of preferential binding to the SERT.

23376217|t|Characterization of the mouse promoter region of the acyl-CoA synthetase 4 gene: role of Sp1 and CREB.
23376217|a|Acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (Acsl4) is involved in several cellular functions including steroidogenesis, synaptic development and cancer metastasis. Although the expression of Acsl4 seems to be regulated by tissue- and cell-specific factors as well as pituitary hormones and growth factors, the transcriptional mechanisms involved remain unknown. We demonstrated hCG and cAMP regulation of Acsl4 mRNA in mouse steroidogenic MA-10 Leydig cells. We characterized the transcription initiation site and promoter of the Acsl4 mouse gene and identified three alternative splice variants present in MA-10 cells. Sequence analysis of a 1.5-kb fragment of the Acsl4 promoter revealed the absence of a TATA box and the presence of many putative binding sites for transcription factors including Sp1 and CREB. Functional characterization revealed that the specificity protein/Kruppel-like factor Sp1 binding site in the proximal promoter is involved in basal activity and that the cAMP response element-binding site is involved in cAMP stimulation of Acsl4 transcription.

23539296|t|p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Regulates the Nuclear Receptor CAR to Activate the CYP2B6 Gene.
23539296|a|The constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) regulates hepatic drug metabolism by activating genes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) and certain transferases. p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is highly activated in human primary hepatocytes but barely in human hepatoma cell-lines including HepG2 cells. Liganded-CAR induced CYP2B6 mRNA in human primary hepatocytes far more effectively than in HepG2 cells ectopically expressing CAR. Here, we have now found that activation of p38 MAPK by anisomycin potentiated induction of CYP2B6 mRNA by CAR ligand in HepG2 cells to levels observed in ligand-treated human primary hepatocytes. siRNA knockdown of p38 MAPK abrogated the ability of anisomycin to synergistically induce CYP2B6 mRNA. In addition to CYP2B6, anisomycin co-treatment potentiated an increase in CYP2A7 and CYP2C9 mRNAs but not CYP3A4 or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 mRNAs. Thus, activated p38 MAPK is required for liganded-CAR to selectively activate a set of genes that encode drug metabolizing enzymes. Our present results suggest that CAR-mediated induction of these enzymes can not be understood by ligand binding alone because the specificity and magnitude of induction are co-determined by a given cell signaling such as p38 MAPK; both physiological and pathophysiological states of cell signaling may have a strong impact in hepatic drug metabolizing capability during therapeutic treatments.

17303537|t|The impact of thyroid activity variations on some oxidizing-stress parameters in rats.
17303537|a|The effect of the thyroid activity on the formation of lipid peroxidation and on liver and heart antioxidant enzyme activities was investigated in Wistar rats. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism conditions were induced for five weeks by the administration of 0.05% benzythiouracile (BTU) and L-thyroxine sodium salt (0.0012%), in drinking water, respectively. No significant effect was observed on the rates of both lipid peroxidation and the vitamin E in hepatic and cardiac tissues of hypothyroidism rats compared to the controls, contrary to the hyperthyroidism rats, which expressed a pronounced increase. The increased glutathione peroxidase activity in rats suffering from hyperthyroidism was associated with a fall of the reduced glutathione in the homogenate and a marked increase in the glutathione reductase activity. An increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities was also recorded in hyperthyroidism. Our results explain the thyroid activity variation in relation to the lipid peroxidation and the tissular contents of the enzymatic and the non-enzymatic antioxidants. To conclude, our results show the occurrence of a state of oxidizing stress in relation to hyperthyroidism.

23298698|t|Locally administered prostaglandin E2 prevents aeroallergen-induced airway sensitization in mice through immunomodulatory mechanisms.
23298698|a|Prostaglandin E2 attenuates airway pathology in asthmatic patients and exerts a protective effect in antigen-sensitized mice when administered systemically. We aimed to establish the consequences of intranasal PGE2 administration on airway reactivity to aeroallergens in mice and reveal the underlying immunoinflammatory mechanisms. PGE2 was administered either daily during a 10-day exposure to house dust mite (HDM) extracts or for limited intervals. Airway hyperreactivity was measured by whole-body and invasive plethysmography. The phenotypes of lung immune cells and cytokine production were analysed by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. Airway hyperreactivity was sustainably reduced only when PGE2 administration was restricted to the initial 5 days of exposure to HDM. Lung inflammation, IL-4 production, and airway mast cell activity were also prevented under this early short-term treatment with PGE2. Interestingly, a Th2 response was already committed on day 5 of exposure to HDM. This was paralleled by GM-CSF and osteopontin upregulation and a decreased number of plasmacytoid dendritic and T regulatory cells, as well as a trend towards reduced IL-10 expression. Local PGE2 administration prevented the increase of airway IL-13 and osteopontin and kept lung plasmacytoid dendritic cell counts close to baseline. GM-CSF and Tregs were unaffected by the treatment. These findings suggest that the protection provided by PGE2 is a result of the modulation of early lung immunomodulatory mechanisms, and possibly a shift in the balance of dendritic cells towards a tolerogenic profile.

23238784|t|Phase 1 and phase 2 drug metabolism and bile acid production of HepaRG cells in a bioartificial liver in absence of dimethyl sulfoxide.
23238784|a|The human liver cell line HepaRG has been recognized as a promising source for in vitro testing of metabolism and toxicity of compounds. However, currently the hepatic differentiation of these cells relies on exposure to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which, as a side effect, has a cytotoxic effect and represses an all-round hepatic functionality. The AMC-bioartificial liver (AMC-BAL) is a three-dimensional bioreactor that has previously been shown to upregulate various liver functions of cultured cells. We therefore cultured HepaRG cells in the AMC-BAL without DMSO and characterized the drug metabolism. Within 14 days of culture, the HepaRG-AMC-BALs contained highly polarized viable liver-like tissue with heterogeneous expression of CYP3A4. We found a substantial metabolism of the tested substrates, ranging from 26% (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1), 47% (CYP3A4), to 240% (CYP2C9) of primary human hepatocytes. The CYP3A4 activity could be induced 2-fold by rifampicin, whereas CYP2C9 activity remained equally high. The HepaRG-AMC-BAL secreted bile acids at 43% the rate of primary human hepatocytes and demonstrated hydroxylation, conjugation, and transport of bile salts. Concluding, culturing HepaRG cells in the AMC-BAL yields substantial phase 1 and phase 2 drug metabolism, while maintaining high viability, rendering DMSO addition superfluous for the promotion of drug metabolism. Therefore, AMC-BAL culturing makes the HepaRG cells more suitable for testing metabolism and toxicity of drugs.

14757703|t|Overexpression of beta 1-adrenoceptors in adult rat ventricular myocytes enhances CGP 12177A cardiostimulation: implications for 'putative' beta 4-adrenoceptor pharmacology.
14757703|a|1. CGP 12177A mediates cardiostimulation by activation of the 'putative' beta(4)-adrenoceptor; however, it has recently been reported that disruption of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor gene abolishes this effect. We have adenovirally overexpressed beta(1)-adrenoceptors in isolated, cultured adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and observed the inotropic potency of isoprenaline and CGP 12177A (in the presence of 1 microm propranolol). 2. Isoprenaline was a full inotropic agonist at rat ventricular myocytes (pD(2) 7.69+/-0.12). CGP 12177A was a nonconventional partial agonist (pD(2) 6.34+/-0.09), increasing inotropy and lusitropy, with an intrinsic activity of 0.34 and antagonised by bupranolol. 3. beta(1)-adrenoceptor overexpression enhanced the inotropic potency of isoprenaline by 11.7-fold (pD(2) 8.76+/-0.14) and CGP 12177A by 5.9-fold (7.11+/-0.10), respectively. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) overexpression did not alter the potency of isoprenaline or CGP 12177A (pD(2) 7.41+/-0.24 and pD(2) 6.60+/-0.50, respectively). 4. The cardiostimulant effects of CGP 12177A were enhanced by IBMX (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and decreased by Rp-cAMPS (cAMP antagonist). CGP 12177A also increased cAMP levels. CGP 12177A but not isoprenaline initiated arrhythmias at lower concentrations following beta(1)-adrenoceptor overexpression. 5. (125)I-Cyanopindolol saturation binding in Adv.beta(1) myocytes demonstrated approximately 18-fold increase in beta(1)-adrenoceptors. (3)H-CGP 12177A saturation binding, in the presence of propranolol, increased approximately 5-fold following overexpression of beta(1)-adrenoceptors. 6. This study demonstrates enhanced cardiostimulation by CGP 12177A (in the presence of propranolol) in rat ventricular myocytes overexpressing beta(1)-adrenoceptors, mediated by a Gs/cAMP signalling pathway. 'Putative' beta(4)-adrenoceptor pharmacology appears to be mediated by activation of a novel affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor.

16917142|t|Treatment of Postmenopausal Breast Cancer with Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs).
16917142|a|Endocrine therapy that targets the estrogen receptor (ER) is a standard of care for the treatment of postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer. The selective ER modulator (SERM) tamoxifen has been in use for the treatment of advanced breast cancer for more than 30 years and is currently a treatment option for all stages of ER-positive disease. Tamoxifen blocks the action of estrogen by binding to the ER, and possesses both ER-agonist and antagonist properties. Unfortunately, long-term use of tamoxifen is associated with several important concerns including an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic complications. In addition, many patients who initially respond to tamoxifen eventually relapse with resistant disease. New treatment approaches are therefore required. A number of alternative SERMs have been tested as substitutes for tamoxifen. These include; toremifene, droloxifene, idoxifene, and keoxifene. Unfortunately, the SERMs have not proved to be more effective than tamoxifen for the treatment of advanced breast cancer and have shown a high level of cross-resistance with tamoxifen. The subsequent development of the aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is an important therapeutic advance by creating a "no estrogen" environment. Another approach is the development of pure antiestrogens. Fulvestrant is a novel ER antagonist that destroys the ER and its signaling pathway and is not associated with tamoxifen-like agonist effects. It produces high response rates compared with other SERMs and is not cross-resistant to tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors and is equally as effective as the AI anastrozole in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who have progressed on prior adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. This review article discusses the significant and continuing value of SERMs for the treatment of postmenopausal ER-positive breast cancer.

23432124|a|IKM-159 was developed and identified as a member of a new class of heterotricyclic glutamate analogues that act as AMPA receptor-selective antagonists. However, it was not known which enantiomer of IKM-159 was responsible for its pharmacological activities. Here, we report in vivo and in vitro neuronal activities of both enantiomers of IKM-159 prepared by enantioselective asymmetric synthesis. By employment of (R)-2-amino-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanol as a chiral auxiliary, (2R)-IKM-159 and the (2S)-counterpart were successfully synthesized in 0.70% and 1.5% yields, respectively, over a total of 18 steps. Both behavioral and electrophysiological assays showed that the biological activity observed for the racemic mixture was reproduced only with (2R)-IKM-159, whereas the (2S)-counterpart was inactive in both assays. Racemic IKM-159 was crystallized with the ligand-binding domain of GluA2, and the structure revealed a complex containing (2R)-IKM-159 at the glutamate binding site. (2R)-IKM-159 locks the GluA2 in an open form, consistent with a pharmacological action as competitive antagonist of AMPA receptors.

22926699|a|The completion of the human genome project and the subsequent advent of DNA microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies have led to a renaissance in molecular toxicology. Toxicogenomic data sets, from both in vivo and in vitro studies, are growing exponentially, providing a wealth of information on regulation of stress pathways at the transcriptome level. Through such studies, we are now beginning to appreciate the diversity and complexity of biological responses to xenobiotics. In this review, we aim to consolidate and summarise the major toxicologically relevant transcription factor-governed molecular pathways. It is becoming clear that different chemical entities can cause oxidative, genotoxic and proteotoxic stress, which induce cellular responses in an effort to restore homoeostasis. Primary among the response pathways involved are NFE2L2 (Nrf2), NFE2L1 (Nrf1), p53, heat shock factor and the unfolded protein response. Additionally, more specific mechanisms exist where xenobiotics act as ligands, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, metal-responsive transcription factor-1 and the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. Other pathways including the immunomodulatory transcription factors NF-kB and STAT together with the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF are also implicated in cellular responses to xenobiotic exposure. A less specific but equally important aspect to cellular injury controlled by transcriptional activity is loss of tissue-specific gene expression, resulting in dedifferentiation of target cells and compromise of tissue function. Here, we review these pathways and the genes they regulate in order to provide an overview of this growing field of molecular toxicology.

23368735|t|The contrasting activity of iodido versus chlorido ruthenium and osmium arene azo- and imino-pyridine anticancer complexes: control of cell selectivity, cross-resistance, p53 dependence, and apoptosis pathway.
23368735|a|Organometallic half-sandwich complexes [M(p-cymene)(azo/imino-pyridine)X](+) where M = Ru(II) or Os(II) and X = Cl or I, exhibit potent antiproliferative activity toward a range of cancer cells. Not only are the iodido complexes more potent than the chlorido analogues, but they are not cross-resistant with the clinical platinum drugs cisplatin and oxaliplatin. They are also more selective for cancer cells versus normal cells (fibroblasts) and show high accumulation in cell membranes. They arrest cell growth in G1 phase in contrast to cisplatin (S phase) with a high incidence of late-stage apoptosis. The iodido complexes retain potency in p53 mutant colon cells. All complexes activate caspase 3. In general, antiproliferative activity is greatly enhanced by low levels of the glutathione synthase inhibitor l-buthionine sulfoxime. The work illustrates how subtle changes to the design of low-spin d(6) metal complexes can lead to major changes in cellular metabolism and to potent complexes with novel mechanisms of anticancer activity.

23358307|t|Synthesis, DNA binding and antitumor evaluation of styelsamine and cystodytin analogues.
23358307|a|A series of N-14 sidechain substituted analogues of styelsamine (pyrido[4,3,2-mn]acridine) and cystodytin (pyrido[4,3,2-mn]acridin-4-one) alkaloids have been prepared and evaluated for their DNA binding affinity and antiproliferative activity towards a panel of human tumor cell lines. Overall it was found that styelsamine analogues were stronger DNA binders, with the natural products styelsamines B and D having particularly high affinity (K(app) 5.33 x 10(6) and 3.64 x 10(6) M(-1), respectively). In comparison, the cystodytin iminoquinone alkaloids showed lower affinity for DNA, but were typically just as active as styelsamine analogues at inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells in vitro. Sub-panel selectivity towards non-small cell lung, melanoma and renal cancer cell lines were observed for a number of the analogues. Correlation was observed between whole cell activity and clogP, with the most potent antiproliferative activity being observed for 3-phenylpropanamide analogues 37 and 41 (NCI panel average GI(50) 0.4 uM and 0.32 uM, respectively) with clogP ~4.0-4.5.

23640331|t|Progesterone receptor induces bcl-x expression through intragenic binding sites favoring RNA polymerase II elongation.
23640331|a|Steroid receptors were classically described for regulating transcription by binding to target gene promoters. However, genome-wide studies reveal that steroid receptors-binding sites are mainly located at intragenic regions. To determine the role of these sites, we examined the effect of progestins on the transcription of the bcl-x gene, where only intragenic progesterone receptor-binding sites (PRbs) were identified. We found that in response to hormone treatment, the PR is recruited to these sites along with two histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and GCN5, leading to an increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation and to the binding of the SWI/SNF complex. Concomitant, a more relaxed chromatin was detected along bcl-x gene mainly in the regions surrounding the intragenic PRbs. PR also mediated the recruitment of the positive elongation factor pTEFb, favoring RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation activity. Together these events promoted the re-distribution of the active Pol II toward the 3'-end of the gene and a decrease in the ratio between proximal and distal transcription. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which PR regulates gene expression by facilitating the proper passage of the polymerase along hormone-dependent genes.

11691635|t|Compensatory changes in enzymes of arginine metabolism during renal hypertrophy in mice.
11691635|a|The present study investigates enzyme activities of the urea cycle, transamidinase and ornithine-proline inter-conversion in the hypertrophied kidney after unilateral nephrectomy in mice. Surgical removal of the left kidney in mice led to compensatory enlargement of the right kidney after 1 and 14 days. This renal growth was associated with an increase in glomerular volume (but not number) and enlargement of the proximal convoluted tubules. The total renal protein content increased in proportion to the increase in kidney weight, but the protein per gram weight of kidney did not change. The specific activity of only ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of ornithine to proline, increased in 2 weeks of hypertrophy. The specific activity of all other enzymes was unchanged. However, the total enzyme activity per kidney of all the enzymes, without exception, was elevated in the hypertrophied kidney. While the increase in total OAT activity was much more than the increase in kidney weight, all other enzymes increased more or less in proportion to the increase in renal mass. The results suggest that compensation in OAT activity to chronic reduction in renal mass was complete, but only partial in the case of other enzymes.

17475961|t|GLP-1 receptor expression in human tumors and human normal tissues: potential for in vivo targeting.
17475961|a|UNLABELLED: Peptide hormone receptors overexpressed in human tumors, such as somatostatin receptors, can be used for in vivo targeting for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. A novel promising candidate in this field is the GLP-1 receptor, which was recently shown to be massively overexpressed in gut and lung neuroendocrine tumors--in particular, in insulinomas. Anticipating a major development of GLP-1 receptor targeting in nuclear medicine, our aim was to evaluate in vitro the GLP-1 receptor expression in a large variety of other tumors and to compare it with that in nonneoplastic tissues. METHODS: The GLP-1 receptor protein expression was qualitatively and quantitatively investigated in a broad spectrum of human tumors (n=419) and nonneoplastic human tissues (n=209) with receptor autoradiography using (125)I-GLP-1(7-36)amide. Pharmacologic competition experiments were performed to provide proof of specificity of the procedure. RESULTS: GLP-1 receptors were expressed in various endocrine tumors, with particularly high amounts in pheochromocytomas, as well as in brain tumors and embryonic tumors but not in carcinomas or lymphomas. In nonneoplastic tissues, GLP-1 receptors were present in generally low amounts in specific tissue compartments of several organs--namely, pancreas, intestine, lung, kidney, breast, and brain; no receptors were identified in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, or the adrenal gland. The rank order of potencies for receptor binding--namely, GLP-1(7-36)amide = exendin-4 >> GLP-2 = glucagon(1-29)--provided proof of specific GLP-1 receptor identification. CONCLUSION: The GLP-1 receptors may represent a novel molecular target for in vivo scintigraphy and targeted radiotherapy for a variety of GLP-1 receptor-expressing tumors. For GLP-1 receptor scintigraphy, a low-background signal can be expected, on the basis of the low receptor expression in the normal tissues surrounding tumors.

23578390|t|Sodium fluoride induces apoptosis in odontoblasts via a JNK-dependent mechanism.
23578390|a|Sodium fluoride (NaF) is widely used for the treatment of dental caries and dentin hypersensitivity. However, its pro-apoptotic effect on odontoblasts may lead to harmful side-effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pro-apoptotic effects of NaF in odontoblasts and elucidate the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. NaF generated cytotoxic effects in odontoblast-lineage cell (OLC) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Exposure of cells to 4mM NaF for 24h induced caspase-3 activation, ultrastructural alterations, and resulted in the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space into the cytosol, indicating that fluoride-mediated apoptosis is mitochondria-dependent. Fluoride treatment also increased phosphorylation of JNK and ERK, but not p38, and apoptosis induced by fluoride was notably or partly suppressed by treatment with JNK or ERK inhibitors, respectively. Taken together, these findings suggest that NaF induces apoptosis in OLC odontoblasts through a JNK-dependent mitochondrial pathway.

23541399|t|Androgen deprivation from pre-puberty to peripuberty interferes in proteins expression in pubertal and adult rat epididymis.
23541399|a|Few studies have focused on experimental testosterone deprivation in immature animals. Therefore, this study used sexually immature rats aiming to evaluate the testes and epididymis histology and proteins expression in these organs on PND50 and 75, after premature antiandrogen exposure, from PND21 to 44. Although the androgen deprivation from pre-puberty up to peripuberty did not alter the histological organization of the testes and epididymis either at puberty or at adulthood, the treatment impaired the expression of specific proteins in epididymal tissue at puberty and adulthood (androgen receptor, calmodulin, Rab11A). These changes may be related to impaired epididymal function, sperm quality and fertility capacity as observed in a previous study. Further studies are necessary to better investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the impairment on reproductive competence of male rats after precocious hormonal injury.

23128353|t|Cell cycle regulation by glucosamine in human pulmonary epithelial cells.
23128353|a|Airway epithelial cells play an important role against intruding pathogens. Glucosamine, a commonly used supplemental compound, has recently begun to be regarded as a potential anti-inflammatory molecule. This study aimed to uncover how glucosamine impacts on cellular proliferation in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) and bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). With trypan blue-exclusion assay, we observed that glucosamine (10, 20, 50 mM) caused a decrease in cell number at 24 and 48 h; with a flow cytometric analysis, we also noted an enhanced cell accumulation within the G(0)/G(1) phase at 24 h and induction of late apoptosis at 24 and 48 h by glucosamine (10, 20, 50 mM) in A549 cells and HBECs. Examination of phosphorylation in retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, we found an inhibitory effect by glucosamine at 20 and 50 mM. Glucosamine at 50 mM was demonstrated to elevate both the mRNA and protein expression of p53 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), but also caused a reduction in p21 protein expression. In addition, glucosamine attenuated p21 protein stability via the proteasomal proteolytic pathway, as well as inducing p21 nuclear accumulation. Altogether, our results suggest that a high dose of glucosamine may inhibit cell proliferation through apoptosis and disturb cell cycle progression with a halt at G(0)/G(1) phase, and that this occurs, at least in part, by a reduction in Rb phosphorylation together with modulation of p21, p53 and HO-1 expression, and nuclear p21 accumulation.

23618901|t|Smad3 mediates cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induction of VEGF release by human fetal lung fibroblasts.
23618901|a|Cigarette smoke is the major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), yet pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the major regulators of endothelial cell survival and is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD. Fibroblasts are a significant source of VEGF in the lungs; however the effect of cigarette smoke exposure on VEGF release by fibroblasts is not fully understood. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke-induced disturbed VEGF release by human lung fibroblasts is a potential pathogenic mechanism that could contribute to COPD. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared by modification of the methods of Carp and Janoff (American Review of Respiratory Disease, 1978). Human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) were exposed to different concentrations of CSE and for different durations. VEGF release into the media was measured using ELISA. TGF-b1 receptor (TbR1)/Smad3 as a potential pathway for CSE modulated VEGF release was also investigated using biochemical analyses and siRNA inhibition of Smad3 and siRNA and pharmacologic inhibition of TbR1. CSE induced VEGF release by HFL-1 in concentration and time dependent manner. This was confirmed in two additional types of primary human fetal lung fibroblasts. CSE induced Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in HFL-1 cells. Silencing of Smad3 by siRNA not only eliminated the stimulatory effect of CSE on VEGF release but also inhibited baseline VEGF production. Suppression of TbR1 by the pharmacological inhibitor (SB431542) markedly reduced VEGF release by HFL-1 in response to CSE and this effect was confirmed by TbR1 siRNA. In contrast, nicotine inhibited VEGF release by HFL-1 in a dose and time dependent manner. Our findings indicate that CSE stimulates Smad3-mediated VEGF release by lung fibroblasts. Nicotine does not account for the CSE stimulation of VEGF in HFL-1. The ability of lung fibroblasts to produce VEGF may play a role in pathogenesis of cigarette smoke induced lung disease.

23534442|t|Novel analgesic/anti-inflammatory agents: 1,5-diarylpyrrole nitrooxyalkyl ethers and related compounds as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibiting nitric oxide donors.
23534442|a|A series of 3-substituted 1,5-diarylpyrroles bearing a nitrooxyalkyl side chain linked to different spacers were designed. New classes of pyrrole-derived nitrooxyalkyl inverse esters, carbonates, and ethers (7-10) as COX-2 selective inhibitors and NO donors were synthesized and are herein reported. By taking into account the metabolic conversion of nitrooxyalkyl ethers (9, 10) into corresponding alcohols, derivatives 17 and 18 were also studied. Nitrooxy derivatives showed NO-dependent vasorelaxing properties, while most of the compounds proved to be very potent and selective COX-2 inhibitors in in vitro experimental models. Further in vivo studies on compounds 9a,c and 17a highlighted good anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities. Compound 9c was able to inhibit glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release induced by interleukin-1b (IL-1b), showing cartilage protective properties. Finally, molecular modeling and (1)H- and (13)C-NMR studies performed on compounds 6c,d, 9c, and 10b allowed the right conformation of nitrooxyalkyl ester and ether side chain of these molecules within the COX-2 active site to be assessed.

15737409|t|Sterol transporters: targets of natural sterols and new lipid lowering drugs.
15737409|a|Recent insights in the role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8, the discovery of ezetimibe, the first approved direct cholesterol absorption inhibitor, as well as the identification of Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein as sterol transporter in the gut, focused attention on sterol transport processes in the small intestine and the liver. The identification of defective structures in the ABCG5 or ABCG8 transporters in patients with the rare disease of sitosterolemia elucidated their role as sterol efflux pumps regulating at least in parts the intestinal sterol absorption and the hepatic sterol output. ABCG5 and ABCG8 themselves are regulated by cholesterol via liver X receptors (LXRs), which are also activated by oxysterols and some derivatives of plant sterols. NPC1L1 could recently be identified as a major sterol transporter for the intestinal uptake of cholesterol as well as plant sterols. Studies in NPC1L1 knockout mice indicate that this transporter is essential for the intestinal uptake of sterols and that NPC1L1 might also be involved in the mechanism of action of ezetimibe. However, studies with photoreactive cholesterol as well as with photoreactive ezetimibe analogues suggest that other processes might also be involved in the mechanism of action of ezetimibe.

18081314|t|Characterization of the substrate mimic bound to engineered prostacyclin synthase in solution using high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and mutagenesis: implication of the molecular mechanism in biosynthesis of prostacyclin.
18081314|a|High-resolution NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the docking of a substrate (prostaglandin H2) mimic (U46619) to the engineered prostacyclin (PGI2) synthase (PGIS) in solution. The binding of U46619 to the PGIS protein was demonstrated by 1D NMR titration, and the significant perturbation of the chemical shifts of protons at C-11, H2C, and H20 of U46619 were observed upon U46619 binding to the engineered PGIS in a concentration-dependent manner. The detailed conformational change and 3D structure of the PGIS-bound U46619 were further demonstrated by 2D 1H NMR experiments using the transferred NOE technique. The distances between the protons H20 and H2, H18 and H2, and H18 and H4 are shorter following their binding to the PGIS in solution-down to within 5 A. These shorter distances resulted in a widely open conformation, where the triangle shape of the unbound U46619 changed to a more compact conformation with an oval shape. The bound conformation of U46619 fits the crystal structure of the PGIS substrate binding pocket considerably better than that of the unbound U46619. The residues important to the substrate binding in the active site pocket of PGIS were also predicted. For example, Trp282 could be one of the most important residues and is suspected to play a role in the determination of specific catalytic function, which has been established by the docking studies using the NMR structure of the PGIS-bound form of U46619 and the PGIS crystal structure. These studies have provided the structural information for the interaction of the PGIS with its substrate mimic. The noted conformational changes where the C-6 position is closer to the C-9 position of U46619 provided the first experimental data for understanding the molecular mechanism of the catalytic function of PGIS in the isomerization of PGH2 to prostacyclin.

22996137|t|Microtubule network is required for insulin-induced signal transduction and actin remodeling.
22996137|a|Both microtubule and actin are required for insulin-induced glucose uptake. However, the roles of these two cytoskeletons and their relationship in insulin action still remain unclear. In this work, we examined the morphological change of microtubule/actin and their involvement in insulin signal transduction using rat skeletal muscle cells. Insulin rapidly led to microtubule clustering from ventral to dorsal surface of the cell. Microtubule filaments were rearranged to create space where new actin structures formed. Disruption of microtubule prevented insulin-induced actin remodeling and distal insulin signal transduction, with reduction in surface glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) and glucose uptake. Though microtubule mediated actin remodeling through PKCz, reorganization of microtubule depended on tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor, the mechanism is different from insulin-induced actin remodeling, which relied on the activity of PI3-kinase and PKCz. We propose that microtubule network is required for insulin-induced signal transduction and actin remodeling in skeletal muscle cells.

15772097|t|Neonatal epileptic encephalopathy caused by mutations in the PNPO gene encoding pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase.
15772097|a|In the mouse, neurotransmitter metabolism can be regulated by modulation of the synthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and failure to maintain pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) levels results in epilepsy. This study of five patients with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy suggests that the same is true in man. Cerebrospinal fluid and urine analyses indicated reduced activity of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase and other PLP-dependent enzymes. Seizures ceased with the administration of PLP, having been resistant to treatment with pyridoxine, suggesting a defect of pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO). Sequencing of the PNPO gene identified homozygous missense, splice site and stop codon mutations. Expression studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that the splice site (IVS3-1g>a) and stop codon (X262Q) mutations were null activity mutations and that the missense mutation (R229W) markedly reduced pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase activity. Maintenance of optimal PLP levels in the brain may be important in many neurological disorders in which neurotransmitter metabolism is disturbed (either as a primary or as a secondary phenomenon).

23270805|t|Coming full circle: contributions of central and peripheral oxytocin actions to energy balance.
23270805|a|The neuropeptide oxytocin has emerged as an important anorexigen in the regulation of energy balance. Its effects on food intake have largely been attributed to limiting meal size through interactions in key regulatory brain regions such as the hypothalamus and hindbrain. Pharmacologic and pair-feeding studies indicate that its ability to reduce body mass extends beyond that of food intake, affecting multiple factors that determine energy balance such as energy expenditure, lipolysis, and glucose regulation. Systemic administration of oxytocin recapitulates many of its effects when administered centrally, raising the questions of whether and to what extent circulating oxytocin contributes to energy regulation. Its therapeutic potential to treat metabolic conditions remains to be determined, but data from diet-induced and genetically obese rodent models as well as application of oxytocin in humans in other areas of research have revealed promising results thus far.

23444334|a|The present study was undertaken to evaluate the possible ameliorating effect of butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT), associated with ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in mice. The treatment of mice with Fe-NTA alone enhances ornithine decarboxylase activity to 4.6 folds, protein carbonyl formation increased up to 2.9 folds and DNA synthesis expressed in terms of [(3)H] thymidine incorporation increased to 3.2 folds, and antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes decreased to 1.8-2.5 folds, compared with the corresponding saline-treated controls. These changes were reversed significantly (p < 0.001) in animals receiving a pretreatment of BHT. Our data show that BHT can reciprocate the toxic effects of Fe-NTA and can serve as a potent chemopreventive agent.

23314320|t|A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for the oxime TMB-4: simulation of rodent and human data.
23314320|a|Multiple oximes have been synthesized and evaluated for use as countermeasures against chemical warfare nerve agents. The current U.S. military and civilian oxime countermeasure, 2-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]-1-methylpyridin-1-ium chloride (2-PAM), is under consideration for replacement with a more effective acetylcholinesterase reactivator, 1,1'-methylenebis{4-hydroxyiminomethyl}pyridinium dimethanesulfonate (MMB-4). Kinetic data in the scientific literature for MMB-4 are limited; therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed for a structurally related oxime, 1,1'-trimethylenebis{4-hydroximinomethyl}pyridinium dibromide. Based on a previous model structure for the organophosphate diisopropylfluorophosphate, the model includes key sites of acetylcholinesterase inhibition (brain and diaphragm), as well as fat, kidney, liver, rapidly perfused tissues and slowly perfused tissues. All tissue compartments are diffusion limited. Model parameters were collected from the literature, predicted using quantitative structure-property relationships or, when necessary, fit to available pharmacokinetic data from the literature. The model was parameterized using rat plasma, tissue and urine time course data from intramuscular administration, as well as human blood and urine data from intravenous and intramuscular administration; sensitivity analyses were performed. The PBPK model successfully simulates rat and human data sets and has been evaluated by predicting intravenous mouse and intramuscular human data not used in the development of the model. Monte Carlo analyses were performed to quantify human population kinetic variability in the human evaluation data set. The model identifies potential pharmacokinetic differences between rodents and humans, indicated by differences in model parameters between species. The PBPK model can be used to optimize the dosing regimen to improve oxime therapeutic efficacy in a human population.

16957773|t|Secretion of L-glutamate from osteoclasts through transcytosis.
16957773|a|Osteoclasts are involved in the catabolism of the bone matrix and eliminate the resulting degradation products through transcytosis, but the molecular mechanism and regulation of transcytosis remain poorly understood. Upon differentiation, osteoclasts express vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), which is essential for vesicular storage and subsequent exocytosis of glutamate in neurons. VGLUT1 is localized in transcytotic vesicles and accumulates L-glutamate. Osteoclasts secrete L-glutamate and the bone degradation products upon stimulation with KCl or ATP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. KCl- and ATP-dependent secretion of L-glutamate was absent in osteoclasts prepared from VGLUT1-/- knockout mice. Osteoclasts express mGluR8, a class III metabotropic glutamate receptor. Its stimulation by a specific agonist inhibits secretion of L-glutamate and bone degradation products, whereas its suppression by a specific antagonist stimulates bone resorption. Finally, it was found that VGLUT1-/- mice develop osteoporosis. Thus, in bone-resorbing osteoclasts, L-glutamate and bone degradation products are secreted through transcytosis and the released L-glutamate is involved in autoregulation of transcytosis. Glutamate signaling may play an important role in the bone homeostasis.

23231502|t|Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase A1 (Pin1) is a target for modification by lipid electrophiles.
23231502|a|Oxidation of membrane phospholipids is associated with inflammation, neurodegenerative disease, and cancer. Oxyradical damage to phospholipids results in the production of reactive aldehydes that adduct proteins and modulate their function. 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), a common product of oxidative damage to lipids, adducts proteins at exposed Cys, His, or Lys residues. Here, we demonstrate that peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase A1 (Pin1), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the peptide bond of pSer/pThr-Pro moieties in signaling proteins from cis to trans, is highly susceptible to HNE modification. Incubation of purified Pin1 with HNE followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry resulted in detection of Michael adducts at the active site residues His-157 and Cys-113. Time and concentration dependencies indicate that Cys-113 is the primary site of HNE modification. Pin1 was adducted in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with 8-alkynyl-HNE as judged by click chemistry conjugation with biotin followed by streptavidin-based pulldown and Western blotting with anti-Pin1 antibody. Furthermore, orbitrap MS data support the adduction of Cys-113 in the Pin1 active site upon HNE treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells. siRNA knockdown of Pin1 in MDA-MB-231 cells partially protected the cells from HNE-induced toxicity. Recent studies indicate that Pin1 is an important molecular target for the chemopreventive effects of green tea polyphenols. The present study establishes that it is also a target for electrophilic modification by products of lipid peroxidation.

23609782|t|Drugs in Development for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis.
23609782|a|Drug development for multiple sclerosis (MS), as with any other neurological disease, faces numerous challenges, with many drugs failing at various stages of development. The disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) first introduced for MS are only moderately effective, but given the lack of competition, they have been widely accepted in clinical practice. Although safety and efficacy continue to be the two main metrics by which drugs will be judged, the newer agents in the market also face challenges of a more comparative nature-are they more efficacious than the currently available drugs on the market? Are they safer or better tolerated? Do they offer any practical advantages over current treatments? Fingolimod represented a milestone following its approval as an oral drug for MS in 2010, offering patients a far more convenient administration route. However, association with cardiovascular complications has led to a more cautious approach in its initial prescribing, now requiring cardiac monitoring for the first 6 h as well as subsequent monitoring of blood pressure and for macular oedema. Natalizumab, amongst licensed drugs, represents the current benchmark for efficacy. The risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy during natalizumab treatment is now more quantifiable. Other monoclonal antibodies are in various phases of development. Marketing authorisation for alemtuzumab has been filed, and whilst trial data suggest that its efficacy outperforms both licensed drugs and others in development, there is a significant risk of secondary autoimmunity. Its once-yearly administration, however, seems particularly advantageous. Rituximab is unlikely to be developed further as its license will expire, but ocrelizumab, another monoclonal antibody directly targeting B cells, is currently in phase 2 development and looks promising. Daclizumab is also moderately efficacious but may struggle to establish itself given its monthly subcutaneous dosing. There are new oral drugs in development, and it is likely that BG-12 will be licensed this year. This has been licensed for psoriasis so there are good safety data in humans that may also hold true in MS; however, its three times daily dosage will probably impact on patient compliance. Laquinimod has lower efficacy than BG-12 but appears safe and could find a place as a first-line agent. Teriflunomide has just been licensed by the US FDA and may challenge the current injectable first-line therapies as it has a similar efficacy but the advantage of being taken orally. However, risk of teratogenicity may caution against its use in some women of child-bearing potential. This review will examine drugs that have been recently approved as well as those that are in late phase 2 or 3 development as treatment for relapsing MS, highlighting their mechanism of action as well as the clinical trial and safety data before discussing their potential for success in an increasingly florid and complex DMT armamentarium.

19293728|t|D1-like receptors inhibit insulin-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via down-regulation of insulin receptor expression.
19293728|a|OBJECTIVE: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation is central to the development of vascular diseases, including hypertension, which is regulated by numerous hormones and humoral factors. Our previous study showed that the stimulatory effect of norepinephrine on VSMC proliferation is inhibited by D1-like receptors and the D3 dopamine receptor, a member of the D2-like receptor family. Insulin is a proliferative hormone but it is not known if there is any interaction between insulin and D1-like receptors. We hypothesized that Dl-like receptors may have an inhibitory effect on the insulin-induced VSMC proliferation; aberrant insulin and Dl-like receptor functions could be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. METHODS: VSMC proliferation was determined by [H]-thymidine incorporation; insulin receptor mRNA and protein expressions were determined by RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Insulin increased VSMC proliferation in immortalized aortic A10 cells, determined by [H]-thymidine incorporation. Although the D1-like receptor, by itself, had no effect on VSMC proliferation, stimulation with fenoldopam, a D1-like receptor agonist, inhibited the stimulatory effect of insulin. The inhibitory effect of fenoldopam on insulin-mediated VSMC proliferation was receptor specific, because its effect could be blocked by SCH23390, a D1-like receptor antagonist. Fenoldopam also inhibited insulin receptor mRNA and protein expression, which was time dependent and concentration dependent. A PKC or MAP kinase inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effect of fenoldopam on insulin receptor expression, indicating that PKC and MAP kinase were involved in the signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect of D1-like receptors on insulin-mediated VSMC proliferation may play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure.

23414340|t|Reduction of dimethylarsinic acid to the highly toxic dimethylarsinous acid by rats and rat liver cytosol.
23414340|a|Dimethylarsinic acid (DMAs(V)), the major urinary metabolite of inorganic arsenic, is weakly cytotoxic, whereas its reduced form, dimethylarsinous acid (DMAs(III)), is highly toxic. Although glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) and arsenic methyltransferase have been shown or thought to catalyze DMAs(V) reduction, their role in DMAs(V) reduction in vivo, or in cell extracts is uncertain. Therefore, the reduction of DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) in rats and in rat liver cytosol was studied to better understand its mechanism. To assess DMAs(V) reduction in rats, a novel procedure was devised based on following the accumulation of red blood cell (RBC)-bound dimethylarsenic (DMAs), which represents DMAs(III), in the blood of DMAs(V)-injected anesthetized rats. These studies indicated that rats reduced DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) to a significant extent, as in 90 min 31% of the injected 50 umol/kg DMAs(V) dose was converted to DMAs(III) that was sequestered by the circulating erythrocytes. Pretreatment of rats with glutathione (GSH) depletors (phorone or BSO) delayed the elimination of DMAs(V) and the accumulation of RBC-bound DMAs, whereas the indirect methyltransferase inhibitor periodate-oxidized adenosine was without effect. Assessment of DMAs(V)-reducing activity of rat liver cytosol revealed that reduction of DMAs(V) required cytosolic protein and GSH and was inhibited by thiol reagents, GSSG and dehydroascorbate. Although thioredoxin reductase (TRR) inhibitors (aurothioglucose and Sb(III)) inhibited cytosolic DMAs(V) reduction, recombinant rat TRR plus NADPH, alone or when added to the cytosol, failed to support DMAs(V) reduction. On ultrafiltration of the cytosol through a 3 kDa filter, the reducing activity in the retentate was lost but was largely restored by NADPH. Such experiments also suggested that the reducing enzyme was larger than 100 kDa and was not GSTO1. In summary, reduction of DMAs(V) to the highly toxic DMAs(III) in rats and rat liver cytosol is a GSH-dependent enzymatic process, yet its mechanism remains uncertain.

17350061|t|Transplacental exposure to inorganic arsenic at a hepatocarcinogenic dose induces fetal gene expression changes in mice indicative of aberrant estrogen signaling and disrupted steroid metabolism.
17350061|a|Exposure to inorganic arsenic in utero in C3H mice produces hepatocellular carcinoma in male offspring when they reach adulthood. To help define the molecular events associated with the fetal onset of arsenic hepatocarcinogenesis, pregnant C3H mice were given drinking water containing 0 (control) or 85 ppm arsenic from day 8 to 18 of gestation. At the end of the arsenic exposure period, male fetal livers were removed and RNA isolated for microarray analysis using 22K oligo chips. Arsenic exposure in utero produced significant (p<0.001) alterations in expression of 187 genes, with approximately 25% of aberrantly expressed genes related to either estrogen signaling or steroid metabolism. Real-time RT-PCR on selected genes confirmed these changes. Various genes controlled by estrogen, including X-inactive-specific transcript, anterior gradient-2, trefoil factor-1, CRP-ductin, ghrelin, and small proline-rich protein-2A, were dramatically over-expressed. Estrogen-regulated genes including cytokeratin 1-19 and Cyp2a4 were over-expressed, although Cyp3a25 was suppressed. Several genes involved with steroid metabolism also showed remarkable expression changes, including increased expression of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-7 (HSD17beta7; involved in estradiol production) and decreased expression of HSD17beta5 (involved in testosterone production). The expression of key genes important in methionine metabolism, such as methionine adenosyltransferase-1a, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase and thioether S-methyltransferase, were suppressed. Thus, exposure of mouse fetus to inorganic arsenic during a critical period in development significantly alters the expression of various genes encoding estrogen signaling and steroid or methionine metabolism. These alterations could disrupt genetic programming at the very early life stage, which could impact tumor formation much later in adulthood.

12761285|t|Biosynthetic regulation and intracellular transport of phosphatidylserine in mammalian cells.
12761285|a|In mammalian cells, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is synthesized through the action of the endoplasmic reticulum enzymes, PtdSer synthase 1 and 2, and the decarboxylation of PtdSer accounts for the majority of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) synthesis. PtdSer decarboxylation for PtdEtn formation occurs in the mitochondria. In addition, the transport of PtdSer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria is probably a rate limiting step for PtdEtn synthesis through the decarboxylation pathway. Therefore, the regulation of PtdSer synthesis and its intracellular transport appear to be essential events for the maintenance of normal cellular PtdSer and PtdEtn levels. Here we describe the current understanding of the regulation of PtdSer biosynthesis and the transport of PtdSer from the ER to the mitochondria in mammalian cells.

23265873|t|Novel limonene and citral based 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles: a natural product coupled approach to semicarbazones for antiepileptic activity.
23265873|a|Two novel series of N(4)-(5-(2/3/4-substituted-phenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-N(1)-(2-methyl-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-2-enylidene)semicarbazide and N(4)-(5-(2/3/4-substituted-phenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-N(1)-(3,7-dimethylocta-3,6-dienylidene)-semicarbazide were synthesized to meet structural prerequisite indispensable for anticonvulsant activity. The anticonvulsant activities of the compounds were investigated using maximal electroshock seizure (MES), subcutaneous pentylenetrtrazole (scPTZ) and subcutaneous strychnine (scSTY) models. The rotorod test was conducted to evaluate neurotoxicity. Some of the selected active compounds were subjected to GABA assay to confirm their mode of action. The outcome of the present investigations proved that the four binding sites pharmacophore model is vital for anticonvulsant activity. The efforts were also made to establish structure-activity relationships among test compounds.

16642960|t|Metabolic syndrome: adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and malonyl coenzyme A.
16642960|a|The metabolic syndrome can be defined as a state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by insulin resistance, central obesity, and a predisposition to type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, premature atherosclerosis, and other diseases. An increasing body of evidence has linked the metabolic syndrome to abnormalities in lipid metabolism that ultimately lead to cellular dysfunction. We review here the hypothesis that, in many instances, the cause of these lipid abnormalities could be a dysregulation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) fuel-sensing and signaling mechanism. Such dysregulation could be reflected by isolated increases in malonyl CoA or by concurrent changes in malonyl CoA and AMPK, both of which would alter intracellular fatty acid partitioning. The possibility is also raised that pharmacological agents and other factors that activate AMPK and/or decrease malonyl CoA could be therapeutic targets.

20347047|t|Increased muscarinic receptor activity of airway smooth muscle isolated from a mouse model of allergic asthma.
20347047|a|The mechanisms leading to airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in asthma are still not fully understood. AHR could be produced by hypersensitivity of the airway smooth muscle or hyperreactivity of the airways. This study was conducted to ascertain whether AHR in a murine model of asthma is produced by changes at the level of the airway smooth muscle. Airway smooth muscle responses were characterised in vitro in isolated trachea spirals from naive mice and from an acute ovalbumin (OVA) challenge model of allergic asthma. AHR was investigated in vivo in conscious, freely moving mice. Inflammatory cell influx into the lungs and antibody responses to the antigen were also measured. In vitro study of tracheal airway smooth muscle from naive mice demonstrated concentration-related contractions to methacholine and 5-HT, but no responses to histamine or adenosine or its stable analogue, 5'-N-ethyl-carboxamidoadenosine. The contractions to 5-HT were inhibited by ketanserin and alosetron indicating involvement of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(3) receptors, respectively. In an acute model of allergic asthma, OVA-treated mice were shown to be atopic by inflammatory cell influx to the lungs after OVA challenge, increases in total IgE and OVA-specific IgG levels and contractions to OVA in isolated trachea. In the asthmatic model, AHR to methacholine was demonstrated in conscious, freely moving mice in vivo and in isolated trachea in vitro 24 and 72h after OVA challenge. No AHR in vitro was seen for 5-HT, histamine or adenosine. These results suggest that, in our mouse model of asthma, changes occur at the level of the muscarinic receptor transduction pathway of coupling to airway smooth muscle contraction. These changes are maintained when tissues are removed from the inflammatory environment and for at least 3 days.

9211565|t|Cinitapride protects against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats: role of 5-hydroxytryptamine, prostaglandins and sulfhydryl compounds.
9211565|a|This study was designed to determine the gastroprotective properties of cinitapride (CNT), a novel prokinetic benzamide derivative agonist of 5-HT4 and 5-HT1 receptors and 5-HT2 antagonist, on mucosal injury produced by 50% (v/v) ethanol. Results were compared with those for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT: 10 mg kg-1). The possible involvements of gastric mucus secretion, endogenous prostaglandins (PGs) and sulfhydryl compounds (SH) in the protection mediated by CNT were also examined. Intraperitoneal administration of CNT (0.50 and 1 mg kg-1), 30 min before ethanol, significantly prevented gastric ulceration and increased the hexosamine content of gastric mucus. CNT (1 mg kg-1) also produced a significant increase in gastric mucosal levels of PGE2, but did not induce any significant changes in SH values. On the contrary, pretreatment with 5-HT worsened ethanol-induced erosions, however, did not affect gastric mucus secretion, glycoprotein content or PGE2 levels, although the non-protein SH fraction was significantly decreased. The present results demonstrate that the gastroprotective effects of CNT could be partly explained by a complex PG dependent mechanism. We suggest that 5-HT dependent mechanisms through 5-HT2 receptor blockade and 5-HT1 receptor activation could be also involved.

9876137|t|State-dependent cocaine block of sodium channel isoforms, chimeras, and channels coexpressed with the beta1 subunit.
9876137|a|Cocaine block of human cardiac (hH1) and rat skeletal (mu1) muscle sodium channels was examined under whole-cell voltage clamp in transiently transfected HEK293t cells. Low affinity block of resting mu1 and hH1 channels at -180 mV was the same, and high affinity block of inactivated channels at -70 mV was the same. Cocaine block of hH1 channels was greater than block of mu1 channels at voltages between -120 mV and -90 mV, suggesting that greater steady-state inactivation of hH1 channels in this voltage range makes them more susceptible to cocaine block. We induced shifts in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation at mu1 and hH1 channels by constructing mu1/hH1 channel chimeras or by coexpressing the wild-type channels with the rat brain beta1 subunit. In contrast to several previous reports, coexpression of the rat brain beta1 subunit with mu1 or hH1 produced large positive shifts in steady-state inactivation. Shifts in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation elicited linear shifts in steady-state cocaine block, yet these manipulations did not affect the cocaine affinity of resting or inactivated channels. These data, as well as simulations used to predict block, indicate that state-dependent cocaine block depends on both steady-state inactivation and channel activation, although inactivation appears to have the predominant role.

23602864|t|Synergistic enhancement of cancer therapy using a combination of heat shock protein targeted HPMA copolymer-drug conjugates and gold nanorod induced hyperthermia.
23602864|a|In the field of nanomedicine, selective delivery to cancer cells is a common goal, where active targeting strategies are often employed to increase tumor accumulation. In this study, tumor hyperthermia was utilized as a means to increase the active delivery of heat shock protein (HSP) targeted N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-drug conjugates. Following hyperthermia, induced expression of cell surface heat shock protein (HSP) glucose regulated protein 78kDa (GRP78) was utilized for targeted drug therapy. Conjugates bearing the anticancer agents aminohexylgeldanamycin (AHGDM), docetaxel (DOC), or cisplatin and the GRP78 targeting peptide WDLAWMFRLPVG were synthesized and characterized. Binding to cell surface expressed heat shock protein GRP78 on the surface of human prostate cancer DU145 cells was evaluated. HSP targeted AHGDM and DOC conjugates demonstrated active binding comparable to native targeting peptide. They were then assessed in vitro for the ability to synergistically induce cytotoxicity in combination with moderate hyperthermia (43oC, 30min). HSP targeted DOC conjugates exhibited high potency against DU145 cells with an IC50 of 2.4nM. HSP targeted AHGDM and DOC conjugates demonstrated synergistic effects in combination with hyperthermia with combination index values of 0.65 and 0.45 respectively. Based on these results, HSP targeted DOC conjugates were selected for in vivo evaluation. In DU145 tumor bearing mice, a single treatment of tumor hyperthermia, induced via gold nanorod mediated plasmonic photothermal therapy, and intravenous administration of HSP targeted HPMA copolymer-docetaxel at 10mg/kg resulted in maintained tumor regression for a period of 30days. These results demonstrate the potential for tumor hyperthermia to increase the delivery of HSP targeted macromolecular chemotherapeutics.

10064839|t|Binding of dimemorfan to sigma-1 receptor and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with dextromethorphan and dextrorphan.
10064839|a|Dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan, DM) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects. The mechanisms of these CNS effects of DM have been suggested to be associated with the low-affinity, noncompetitive, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism of DM and/or the high-affinity DM/sigma receptors. DM is largely O-demethylated into the phencyclidine (PCP)-like compound dextrorphan (DR), which may limit its therapeutic use by producing PCP-like adverse effects, such as hyperlocomotion. Dimemorfan ((+)-3-methyl-N-methylmorphinan, DF), an analog of DM, which has been safely used as an antitussive for more than 20 years, is also known not to form DR. This study therefore characterized the binding of DF to the sigma receptors and NMDA-linked PCP sites and examined the anticonvulsant as well as locomotor effects of DF in mice in comparison with those of DM and DR. We found that DF, DM, and DR were relative high-affinity ligands at sigma-1 receptors (Ki=151, 205, 144 nM, respectively) while all of them were with low affinity at sigma-2 receptors (Ki=4-11 microM). Only DR exhibited moderate affinity for PCP sites (Ki=0.9 microM), whereas DF (Ki=17 microM) and DM (Ki=7 microM) were much less active. DF, DM and DR produced prominent anticonvulsant effects in mice as measured by the supramaximal electroshock test with comparable potency (ED50 approximately 70 micromol/kg, i.p.). At the tested doses (20-260 micromol/kg, i.p.), DM and DR exhibited biphasic effects on the locomotor activity whereas DF produced a consistent dose-dependent decrease. These results revealed that, unlike DM and DR, DF did not cause a PCP-like hyperlocomotion adverse effect that is parallel with the PCP sites binding data. Furthermore, since they have equipotent anticonvulsant effects and similar binding affinities to sigma-1 receptors, the very low affinity of DF at PCP sites may suggest that acting on the PCP sites may not be the requisite for mediating the anticonvulsant activity of these DM analogs. With the history of safety and relative less adverse effects, DF appears to be worth further studying on its CNS effects other than the antitussive effect.

22898212|t|Cresyl saligenin phosphate makes multiple adducts on free histidine, but does not form an adduct on histidine 438 of human butyrylcholinesterase.
22898212|a|Cresyl saligenin phosphate (CBDP) is a suspected causative agent of "aerotoxic syndrome", affecting pilots, crew members and passengers. CBDP is produced in vivo from ortho-containing isomers of tricresyl phosphate (TCP), a component of jet engine lubricants and hydraulic fluids. CBDP irreversibly inhibits butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in human plasma by forming adducts on the active site serine (Ser-198). Inhibited BChE undergoes aging to release saligenin and o-cresol. The active site histidine (His-438) was hypothesized to abstract o-hydroxybenzyl moiety from the initial adduct on Ser-198. Our goal was to test this hypothesis. Mass spectral analysis of CBDP-inhibited BChE digested with Glu-C showed an o-hydroxybenzyl adduct (+106amu) on lysine 499, a residue far from the active site, but not on His-438. Nevertheless, the nitrogen of the imidazole ring of free l-histidine formed a variety of adducts upon reaction with CBDP, including the o-hydroxybenzyl adduct, suggesting that histidine-CBDP adducts may form on other proteins.

23380082|t|Use of the Combination Index to determine interactions between plant-derived phenolic acids on hepatotoxicity endpoints in human and rat hepatoma cells.
23380082|a|The beneficial or adverse effects of isolated phytochemicals are not always concordant with effects of the botanical dietary supplements from which they were derived. This disparity could be due to interactions between the various phytochemicals present in the whole plant. The phenolic acids, rosmarinic acid (RA), caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA) are widely present in foods and dietary supplements, and they are assumed to exert various beneficial biological effects. However, there is little data on the potential biological interactions of these three phenolic acids which commonly occur together and are linked metabolically. In the present study, liver toxicity of the three phenolic acids was assessed on the three compounds singly and in various binary and one ternary combinations. A series of in vitro endpoints relevant to liver toxicity were evaluated in both a human (HepG2/C3A) and rat (MH1C1) hepatocyte cell line. The Combination Index (CI) was calculated for each endpoint from both the concentration responses of the single compounds and the responses of the various binary and ternary mixtures. Both synergistic and antagonistic interactions were observed for some endpoints and some combinations of test agents. Interactions were most prevalent in measures of oxidative stress and cytochrome P450 activities in both cell types. There was only a 53% concordance between the rat and human cells which may be suggestive of species differences. The data suggest an approach for better characterizing the beneficial or adverse effects of complex botanical products through evaluation of interactions between individual phytochemical components.

23418368|t|The Prevalence of Meeting A1C, Blood Pressure, and LDL Goals Among People With Diabetes, 1988-2010.
23418368|a|OBJECTIVETo determine the prevalence of people with diabetes who meet hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C), blood pressure (BP), and LDL cholesterol (ABC) recommendations, and their current statin use, factors associated with goal achievement, and changes in the proportion achieving goals between 1988 and 2010.RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODSData were cross-sectional from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1988-1994, 1999-2002, 2003-2006, and 2007-2010. Participants were 4,926 adults aged >20 years who self-reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes and completed the household interview and physical examination (n = 1,558 for valid LDL levels). Main outcome measures were A1C, BP, and LDL cholesterol, in accordance with the American Diabetes Association recommendations, and current use of statins.RESULTSIn 2007-2010, 52.5% of people with diabetes achieved A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol), 51.1% achieved BP <130/80 mmHg, 56.2% achieved LDL <100 mg/dL, and 18.8% achieved all three ABCs. These levels of control were significant improvements from 1988 to 1994 (all P < 0.05). Statin use significantly increased between 1988-1994 (4.2%) and 2007-2010 (51.4%, P < 0.01). Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Mexican Americans were less likely to meet A1C and LDL goals (P < 0.03), and non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to meet BP and LDL goals (P < 0.02). Compared with non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans were less likely to meet A1C goals (P < 0.01). Younger individuals were less likely to meet A1C and LDL goals.CONCLUSIONSDespite significant improvement during the past decade, achieving the ABC goals remains suboptimal among adults with diabetes, particularly in some minority groups. Substantial opportunity exists to further improve diabetes control and, thus, to reduce diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.

23384997|t|Characterization of cytosolic glutathione peroxidase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase genes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and their modulation by in vitro selenium exposure.
23384997|a|Selenium (Se) is an oligonutrient with both essential biological functions and recognized harmful effects. As the selenocysteine (SeCys) amino acid, selenium is integrated in several Se-containing proteins (selenoproteins), many of which are fundamental for cell homeostasis. Nevertheless, selenium may exert toxic effects at levels marginally above those required, mainly through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The selenium chemical speciation can strongly affect the bioavailability of this metal and its impact on metabolism, dictating the levels that can be beneficial or detrimental towards an organism. Glutathione peroxidase (GPxs) is the largest and the most studied selenoprotein family. Cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (cGPx, GPx1) and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx, GPx4) are widely distributed throughout tissues, and play a pivotal role in regulating the oxidative status in the cell. In this study we have cloned GPx1 and GPx4 genes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The constitutive mRNA expression of these GPx genes was examined in 18 trout tissues and their responsiveness to Se availability was analysed using a rainbow trout liver cell line (RTL). An inorganic (sodium selenite, Na2SeO3) and organic (selenocysteine, Cys-Se-Se-Cys) selenocompound have been used as Se sources. GPx1 activity was also tested to verify the impact of transcript changes on the enzymatic function of these molecules. To understand if the results obtained from the transcript expression analysis were due to Se bioavailability or generation of ROS, the cytoxicity of the two selenocompounds was tested by measuring the impact of Se on cell membrane integrity. Lastly, Se availability was quantified by mass spectrophotometry to determine the amount of Se in the cell culture media, the Se background due to the foetal calf serum supplement and the contribution from the two selenocompounds used in the treatments. Three isoforms of genes for both GPx1 (GPx1a, 1b1 and 1b2) and GPx4 (GPx4a1, a2 and b) have been identified. The discovery of a third gene encoding for GPx1 and GPx4 hints that salmonids may have the biggest selenoproteome amongst all vertebrates. Transcripts of GPx4 genes were more highly expressed in most tissues examined in vivo (except blood, head kidney and spleen), whereas those of the GPx1 genes were more responsive to selenium exposure in vitro, especially to the organic form. Interestingly, GPx1a was the most sensitive to selenium availability in non stressful conditions, whereas GPx1b1 and GPx1b2 were highly induced by exposure to selenium levels that had some toxic effects on the cells. Although the different concentrations tested of the two selenocompounds modulate GPx1 transcript expression to various degrees, no significant change of GPx1 enzymatic activity was detectable. Our results lead us to conclude that trout GPx1 transcripts expression level may represent a sensitive biomarker for selenium intake, helping to evaluate if selenium concentration and chemical speciation impact on cell homeostasis.

23644213|a|Dual antithrombotic agents acting as anticoagulants and aggregation inhibitors could have substantial advantages over currently prescribed combinations of antithrombotic drugs. Herein, we report compounds with moderate inhibitory activity for factor Xa and fibrinogen GPIIb/IIIa binding (both in the micromolar range). These compounds resulted from our efforts to merge the pharmacophores of selective factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban with a mimic of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence of fibrinogen to obtain designed multiple ligands with potential antithrombotic activity. Resulting from this study, a structurally novel class of submicromolar fibrinogen GPIIb/IIIa binding inhibitor bearing 1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-one moiety is also described.

23318685|t|Peginesatide clearance, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in monkeys following intravenous administration.
23318685|a|Peginesatide, a polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated peptide-based erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, stimulates the erythropoietin receptor dimer that governs erythropoiesis. Studies were designed to determine the erythropoietic response, pharmacokinetics (PK), tissue distribution, metabolism, and excretion of peginesatide in nonhuman primates following a single i.v. dose. The PK profile of peginesatide (0.1-5 mg/kg) is characterized by low, dose-dependent plasma clearance; small volume of distribution; and long half-life. The peginesatide PK profile following a single i.v. dose is consistent with the sustained erythropoiesis. Biodistribution quantitative whole-body autoradiography demonstrated high peginesatide levels in bone marrow (i.e., primary hematopoietic site) as well as other known hematopoietic sites persisting through at least 3 weeks at 2.1 mg/kg. Microautoradiography analysis at 48 hours postdose revealed uniform and high distribution of radioactivity in the bone marrow and splenic red pulp with less extensive distribution in the renal cortex (glomeruli, associated ducts, interstitial cells). Radioactivity in the kidney was most prominent in the outer medullary and papillary interstitium. At 2 weeks after dosing, cumulative radioactivity recovery in the urine and feces was 60 and 7% of the administered dose, respectively, with most of the radioactivity associated with the parent molecule. In conclusion, the PK characteristics are consistent with a PEGylated peptide of a 45-kDa molecular mass, specifically low volume of distribution and long half-life. Drug was localized principally to hematopoietic sites, and nonspecific tissue retention was not observed. The nonhuman primate data indicate that peginesatide is metabolically stable and primarily excreted in the urine.

10662748|t|Sodium channel blockers identify risk for sudden death in patients with ST-segment elevation and right bundle branch block but structurally normal hearts.
10662748|a|BACKGROUND: A mutation in the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A) has been described in patients with the syndrome of right bundle branch block, ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V3, and sudden death (Brugada syndrome). These electrocardiographic manifestations are transient in many patients with the syndrome. The present study examined arrhythmic risk in patients with overt and concealed forms of the disease and the effectiveness of sodium channel blockers to unmask the syndrome and, thus, identify patients at risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of intravenous ajmaline (1 mg/kg), procainamide (10 mg/kg), or flecainide (2 mg/kg) on the ECG was studied in 34 patients with the syndrome and transient normalization of the ECG (group A), 11 members of 3 families in whom a SCN5A mutation was associated with the syndrome and 8 members in whom it was not (group B), and 53 control subjects (group C). Ajmaline, procainamide, or flecainide administration resulted in ST-segment elevation and right bundle branch block in all patients in group A and in all 11 patients with the mutation in group B. A similar pattern could not be elicited in the 8 patients in group B who lacked the mutation or in any person in group C. The follow-up period (37+/-33 months) revealed no differences in the incidence of arrhythmia between the 34 patients in whom the phenotypic manifestation of the syndrome was transient and the 24 patients in whom it was persistent (log-rank, 0.639). CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrated a similar incidence of potentially lethal arrhythmias in patients displaying transient versus persistent ST-segment elevation and right bundle branch block, as well as the effectiveness of sodium channel blockers to unmask the syndrome and, thus, identify patients at risk.

23455597|t|Assessment of the abuse liability of ABT-288, a novel histamine H3 receptor antagonist.
23455597|a|RATIONALE: Histamine H3 receptor antagonists, such as ABT-288, have been shown to possess cognitive-enhancing and wakefulness-promoting effects. On the surface, this might suggest that H3 antagonists possess psychomotor stimulant-like effects and, as such, may have the potential for abuse. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to further characterize whether ABT-288 possesses stimulant-like properties and whether its pharmacology gives rise to abuse liability. METHODS: The locomotor-stimulant effects of ABT-288 were measured in mice and rats, and potential development of sensitization was addressed. Drug discrimination was used to assess amphetamine-like stimulus properties, and drug self-administration was used to evaluate reinforcing effects of ABT-288. The potential development of physical dependence was also studied. RESULTS: ABT-288 lacked locomotor-stimulant effects in both rats and mice. Repeated administration of ABT-288 did not result in cross-sensitization to the stimulant effects of d-amphetamine in mice, suggesting that there is little overlap in circuitries upon which the two drugs interact for motor activity. ABT-288 did not produce amphetamine-like discriminative stimulus effects in drug discrimination studies nor was it self-administered by rats trained to self-administer cocaine. There were no signs of physical dependence upon termination of repeated administration of ABT-288 for 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: The sum of these preclinical data, the first of their kind applied to H3 antagonists, indicates that ABT-288 is unlikely to possess a high potential for abuse in the human population and suggests that H3 antagonists, as a class, are similar in this regard.

23273219|t|Synthesis, molecular modeling and evaluation of novel N'-2-(4-benzylpiperidin-/piperazin-1-yl)acylhydrazone derivatives as dual inhibitors for cholinesterases and Ab aggregation.
23273219|a|To develop new drugs for treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a group of N'-2-(4-Benzylpiperidin-/piperazin-1-yl)acylhydrazones was designed, synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and aggregation of amyloid beta peptides (1-40, 1-42 and 1-40_1-42). The enzyme inhibition assay results indicated that compounds moderately inhibit both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. b-Amyloid aggregation results showed that all compounds exhibited remarkable Ab fibril aggregation inhibition activity with a nearly similar potential as the reference compound rifampicin, which makes them promising anti-Alzheimer drug candidates. Docking experiments were carried out with the aim to understand the interactions of the most active compounds with the active site of the cholinesterase enzymes.

20421509|t|Phenothiazines inhibit S100A4 function by inducing protein oligomerization.
20421509|a|S100A4, a member of the S100 family of Ca(2+)-binding proteins, regulates carcinoma cell motility via interactions with myosin-IIA. Numerous studies indicate that S100A4 is not simply a marker for metastatic disease, but rather has a direct role in metastatic progression. These observations suggest that S100A4 is an excellent target for therapeutic intervention. Using a unique biosensor-based assay, trifluoperazine (TFP) was identified as an inhibitor that disrupts the S100A4/myosin-IIA interaction. To examine the interaction of S100A4 with TFP, we determined the 2.3 A crystal structure of human Ca(2+)-S100A4 bound to TFP. Two TFP molecules bind within the hydrophobic target binding pocket of Ca(2+)-S100A4 with no significant conformational changes observed in the protein upon complex formation. NMR chemical shift perturbations are consistent with the crystal structure and demonstrate that TFP binds to the target binding cleft of S100A4 in solution. Remarkably, TFP binding results in the assembly of five Ca(2+)-S100A4/TFP dimers into a tightly packed pentameric ring. Within each pentamer most of the contacts between S100A4 dimers occurs through the TFP moieties. The Ca(2+)-S100A4/prochlorperazine (PCP) complex exhibits a similar pentameric assembly. Equilibrium sedimentation and cross-linking studies demonstrate the cooperative formation of a similarly sized S100A4/TFP oligomer in solution. Assays examining the ability of TFP to block S100A4-mediated disassembly of myosin-IIA filaments demonstrate that significant inhibition of S100A4 function occurs only at TFP concentrations that promote S100A4 oligomerization. Together these studies support a unique mode of inhibition in which phenothiazines disrupt the S100A4/myosin-IIA interaction by sequestering S100A4 via small molecule-induced oligomerization.

17632107|t|Ligand-dependent transcriptional activities of four torafugu pufferfish Takifugu rubripes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.
17632107|a|Structural and functional properties were investigated for four peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), PPARalpha1, PPARalpha2, PPARbeta, and PPARgamma, from torafugu pufferfish Takifugu rubripes and determined for their transcriptional activity by the reporter assay using reporter plasmids containing three copies of the acyl-CoA oxidase PPAR response element. Although torafugu PPARs showed a high similarity in the primary structure to other vertebrate counterparts, torafugu PPARalpha2 and gamma contained additional sequences of 21 and 28 amino acids, respectively, as in the case of other teleost fish species when compared with African clawed frog counterparts. The transcriptional activity of torafugu PPARalpha1 was enhanced 4.5- and 11.5-fold by Wy-14643 and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) each at 10 microM, respectively, whereas that of PPARalpha2, 4.5- and 7.3-fold at the same concentration of the respective ligands, respectively. The activities of torafugu PPARalpha1 and alpha2 were also enhanced 5.6- and 6.3-fold by ETYA at 1 microM, respectively, but not by Wy-14643 at this concentration. Furthermore, the activities of the two torafugu PPARalphas were enhanced 4.3- and 7.6-fold by arachidonic acid, 4.4- and 5.2-fold by docosahexaenoic acid, and 6.7- and 8.0-fold by eicosapentaenoic acid each at 50 microM, respectively. On the other hand, the activities of torafugu PPARbeta and gamma were not changed by Wy-14643, ETYA, rosiglitazone, nor PUFAs. These results suggest that the activities of torafugu PPARbeta and gamma require undefined ligands. Alternatively, the molecular mechanisms involved in their activation are different from those of other vertebrates.

23454148|t|Effect of protein malnutrition on the metabolism and toxicity of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C in rat stomach.
23454148|a|This study investigated the effect of protein malnutrition on metabolism and toxicity of cisplatin (CP), 5-fluorouracil (FU) and mitomycin C (MMC) in rat stomach. Weanling male Wistar rats received a normal (24%) or low (2.5%) protein diet for 28days and were allocated into: normally-fed control, protein-malnourished control (PM), 3 normally-fed drug-treated groups and 3 protein-malnourished drug-treated groups (PM-CP, PM-FU and PM-MMC). Cisplatin and MMC were injected intraperitoneally (8mg/kg on day 26 and 1mg/kg/day for 7days, respectively). 5-Fluorouracil was given orally (50mg/kg/day for 5days). Compared with normally-fed counterparts, PM-CP rats exhibited higher glutathione S-transferase, aminopeptidase N and cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase (CCBL) and lower gamma-glutamyltransferase activities, PM-FU rats exhibited decreased dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 1A1/2 activities and PM-MMC rats showed higher quinone reductase and depleted xanthine oxidase activities. Protein-malnourished drug-treated groups exhibited exacerbated gastrotoxicity, relative to normally-fed counterparts, manifested by lower mucus levels, higher permeability and histopathological deterioration, along with increased oxidative stress in PM-CP rats and exaggerated prostaglandin E2 production in PM-MMC rats. Conclusively, protein malnutrition alters CP, FU and MMC metabolism in rat stomach by enhancing CCBL pathway for CP activation, delaying FU elimination and activating two-electron reduction of MMC, potentiating their gastrotoxicity.

23398572|t|Strong effects of cluster size and air exposure on oxygen reduction and carbon oxidation electrocatalysis by size-selected Pt(n) (n < 11) on glassy carbon electrodes.
23398572|a|Model Pt(n)/glassy carbon electrodes (Pt(n)/GCE) were prepared by deposition of mass-selected Pt(n)(+) (n < 11) on GCE substrates in ultrahigh vacuum. Electrocatalysis under conditions appropriate for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied, for samples both in situ with no exposure to laboratory air and with air exposure prior to electrochemical measurements. Of the small clusters, only a few cluster sizes show the expected ORR activity, and in those cases, the activity per Pt atom is similar to that seen under identical conditions with a conventionally prepared electrode with Pt nanoparticles grown on a GCE. For other small Pt(n) on GCE, any ORR signal is overwhelmed by large oxidative currents attributed to catalysis of carbon oxidation by water. If the samples are exposed to air prior to electrochemistry, both ORR and carbon oxidation signals are absent, and instead only small capacitive currents or currents attributed to redox chemistry of adventitious organic adsorbates are observed, indicating that air exposure results in passivation of the small Pt clusters.

16774921|t|Functional divergence of a unique C-terminal domain of leucyl-tRNA synthetase to accommodate its splicing and aminoacylation roles.
16774921|a|Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) performs dual essential roles in group I intron RNA splicing as well as protein synthesis within the yeast mitochondria. Deletions of the C terminus differentially impact the two functions of the enzyme in splicing and aminoacylation in vivo. Herein, we determined that a fiveamino acid C-terminal deletion of LeuRS, which does not complement a null strain, can form a ternary complex with the bI4 intron and its maturase splicing partner. However, the complex fails to stimulate splicing activity. The x-ray co-crystal structure of LeuRS showed that a C-terminal extension of about 60 amino acids forms a discrete domain, which is unique among the LeuRSs and interacts with the corner of the L-shaped tRNALeu. Interestingly, deletion of the entire yeast mitochondrial LeuRS C-terminal domain enhanced its aminoacylation and amino acid editing activities. In striking contrast, deletion of the corresponding C-terminal domain of Escherichia coli LeuRS abolished aminoacylation of tRNALeu and also amino acid editing of mischarged tRNA molecules. These results suggest that the role of the leucine-specific C-terminal domain in tRNA recognition for aminoacylation and amino acid editing has adapted differentially and with surprisingly opposite effects. We propose that the secondary role of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS in RNA splicing has impacted the functional evolution of this critical C-terminal domain.

9832994|t|Antagonism of meta-chlorophenylpiperazine-induced inhibition of exploratory activity in an emergence procedure, the open field test, in rats.
9832994|a|The effects of meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) were studied on exploratory behaviour in the open field test, using a procedure designed to evaluate the emergence of rats into a novel environment. mCPP reduced the exploratory activity in a dose-related manner after subcutaneous (s.c.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intravenous (i.v.) administration. The inhibition was manifest in all the parameters used to quantify the exploration of the open field area. Additional neuroendocrine experiments in a parallel group of rats revealed a dose-related increase in plasma prolactin and ACTH levels after i.v. mCPP, pointing to a general state of arousal in these mCPP-treated animals. A number of 5-HT antagonists were tested for their ability to prevent or reverse the behavioural inhibition induced by an i.v. injection of 1.0 g/kg mCPP given 15 min before testing in the open field. The antagonists were injected s.c. or given orally at various time intervals before mCPP, or they were injected i.v. 10 min after mCPP. The lowest active doses for the attentuation of the mCPP-induced behavioural inhibition after s.c., oral and i.v. administration, respectively, were 0.04, 40 and 10 mg/kg for pizotifen; 0.16, 0.16 and 0.16 mg/kg for mianserin; 0.63, 0.16 and 0.16 mg/kg for methysergide, and 0.16, 2.5 and 2.5 mg/kg for ritanserin. The lowest active doses of mirtazapine after s.c. and i.v. treatment were 0.01 and 0.16 mg/kg. These data indicate that mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonists such as pizotifen and methysergide, and mixed 5-HT and catecholamine antagonists such as mianserin and mirtazapine are more potent antagonists of mCPP-induced behavioural inhibition in rats than the more selective 5-HT2A/5-HT2C antagonist ritanserin.

16432501|t|Systemic administration of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists, formoterol and salmeterol, elicit skeletal muscle hypertrophy in rats at micromolar doses.
16432501|a|beta(2)-Adrenoceptor agonists provide a potential therapy for muscle wasting and weakness, but their use may be limited by adverse effects on the heart, mediated in part, by beta(1)-adrenoceptor activation. Two beta(2)-agonists, formoterol and salmeterol, are approved for treating asthma and have an extended duration of action and increased safety, associated with greater beta(2)-adrenoceptor selectivity. The pharmacological profiles of formoterol and salmeterol and their effects on skeletal and cardiac muscle mass were investigated in 12-week-old, male F344 rats. Formoterol and salmeterol were each administered via daily i.p. injection at one of seven doses (ranging from 1 to 2,000 microg kg(-1) day(-1)), for 4 weeks. Rats were anaesthetised and the EDL and soleus muscles and the heart were excised and weighed. Dose-response curves were constructed based on skeletal and cardiac muscle hypertrophy. Formoterol was more potent than salmeterol, with a significantly lower ED(50) in EDL muscles (1 and 130 microg kg(-1) day(-1), P <0.05), whereas salmeterol had greater intrinsic activity than formoterol in both EDL and soleus muscles (12% greater hypertrophy than formoterol). The drugs had similar potency and intrinsic activity in the heart, with a smaller leftward shift for formoterol than seen in skeletal muscle. A dose of 25 microg kg(-1) day(-1) of formoterol elicited greater EDL and soleus hypertrophy than salmeterol, but resulted in similar beta-adrenoceptor downregulation. These results show that doses as low as 1 microg kg(-1) day(-1) of formoterol can elicit significant muscle hypertrophy with minimal cardiac hypertrophy and provide important information regarding the potential therapeutic use of formoterol and salmeterol for muscle wasting.

11089538|t|Characterization of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-related proteins (IGFBP-rPs) 1, 2, and 3 in human prostate epithelial cells: potential roles for IGFBP-rP1 and 2 in senescence of the prostatic epithelium.
11089538|a|Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein (IGFBP)-related proteins (IGFBP-rPs) are newly described cysteine-rich proteins that share significant aminoterminal structural similarity with the conventional IGFBPs and are involved in a diversity of biological functions, including growth regulation. IGFBP-rP1 (MAC25/Angiomodulin/prostacyclin-stimulating factor) is a potential tumor-suppressor gene that is differentially expressed in meningiomas, mammary and prostatic cancers, compared with their malignant counterparts. We have previously shown that IGFBP-rP1 is preferentially produced by primary cultures of human prostate epithelial cells (HPECs) and by poorly tumorigenic P69SV40T cells, compared with the cancerous prostatic LNCaP, DU145, PC-3, and M12 cells. We now show that IGFBP-rP1 increases during senescence of HPEC. IGFBP-rP2 (also known as connective tissue growth factor), a downstream effector of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and modulator of growth for both fibroblasts and endothelial cells, was detected in most of the normal and malignant prostatic epithelial cells tested, with a marked up-regulation of IGFBP-rP2 during senescence of HPEC. Moreover, IGFBP-rP2 noticeably increased in response to TGF-beta1 and all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) in HPEC and PC-3 cells, and it decreased in response to IGF-I in HPEC. IGFBP-rP3 [nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV)], the protein product of the NOV protooncogene, was not detected in HPEC but was expressed in the tumorigenic DU145 and PC-3 cells. It was also synthesized by the SV40-T antigen-transformed P69 and malignant M12 cells, where it was down-regulated by atRA. These observations suggest biological roles of IGFBP-rPs in the human prostate. IGFBP-rP1 and IGFBP-rP2 are likely to negatively regulate growth, because they seem to increase during senescence of the prostate epithelium and in response to growth inhibitors (TGF-beta1 and atRA). Although the data collected on IGFBP-rP3 in prostate are modest, its role as a growth stimulator and/or protooncogene is supported by its preferential expression in cancerous cells and its down-regulation by atRA.

3134891|t|Characteristics of the binding of phenoxybenzamine to calmodulin.
3134891|a|To determine the factors that influence the interaction between phenoxybenzamine and calmodulin, the binding of phenoxybenzamine to calmodulin was determined by equilibrium dialysis under a variety of experimental conditions. This interaction was found to be similar in some respects to the interaction between phenothiazines and calmodulin. It was saturable, with between 1 and 2 mol of phenoxybenzamine bound to 1 mol of calmodulin. It was also dependent upon temperature, the presence of a divalent cation such as calcium, and on pH, showing maximum binding at pH 6.5 with little binding at pH values below 4.2 or above 8.0. The site at which phenoxybenzamine bound to calmodulin appears to be similar to that at which certain antipsychotic agents bind, since several of them, including penfluridol, pimozide and spiroperidol, prevented the binding of phenoxybenzamine to calmodulin. However, in contrast to the reversible binding of most phenothiazines to calmodulin, phenoxybenzamine bound to calmodulin irreversibly. The binding of phenoxybenzamine to calmodulin was fairly selective in that other alpha-adrenergic agents such as prazosin, yohimbine and clonidine failed to bind to calmodulin when examined under the same experimental conditions. In addition, phenoxybenzamine showed little or no calcium-dependent binding to the S-100 protein, bovine serum albumin or cytochrome c. The irreversible complex between phenoxybenzamine and calmodulin may be useful for inhibiting certain calmodulin-dependent reactions and for studying the various biological functions of calmodulin.

23603381|t|Ellagic acid attenuates bleomycin and cyclophosphamide-induced pulmonary toxicity in Wistar rats.
23603381|a|Use of bleomycin (BLM) and cyclophosphamide (CP) as chemotherapeutic drugs is associated with side effects including toxicity to respiratory system. Their co-administration may enhance lung toxicity which may subsequently progress to the lung fibrosis. Natural compounds have shown mitigating effects against toxicity of anticancer drugs. Ellagic acid (EA), a polyphenolic compound present in many fruits and nuts in addition to walnut has shown promising protective effect against toxicity of drugs and chemicals. We studied the ameliorative effect of EA on lung toxicity in rats exposed to CP (150mg/kgb.w., i.p.) and BLM (10U/kgb.w., i.t.). EA (15mg/kgb.w., p.o.x14days) treatment modulated enhanced hydroxyproline level, lipid peroxidation, myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide production and protein carbonyl formation in lungs of rats exposed to toxic anticancer drugs. There was a marked decrease in GSH content and activities of antioxidant enzymes as a result of BLM and CP treatment. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed increased level of cytotoxicity markers in drug treated animals. Treatment with EA attenuated these changes. Histopathological findings also showed protective effects of EA. In conclusion, EA emerged as a natural protectant with an ability to protect lungs from onslaught of pulmonary toxicity of anticancer drugs.

23370008|t|Serum amyloid A upsurge precedes standard biomarkers of hepatotoxicity in ritodrine-injected mice.
23370008|a|The tocolytic agent ritodrine acts on the b2-adrenoceptor and is an effective treatment option for preterm labor. However, several adverse effects of ritodrine therapy, including liver damage, have been noted. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of ritodrine-induced adverse effects, development of sensitive biomarkers of these adverse events is necessary. Here, we report the development and analysis of an animal model of ritodrine-induced liver damage. Female mice received daily ritodrine injections for 2 weeks; liver samples were then collected and subjected to DNA microarray analysis. Ritodrine significantly altered the expression of genes related to steroid and lipid metabolism, as well as the metabolism of ritodrine itself. Importantly, expression of the acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A (SAA) significantly increased after ritodrine injection, with values indicating the largest fold-change. This large increase in blood SAA levels serves as a more sensitive biomarker than conventional liver enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. The increase in SAA expression is specific to ritodrine-induced liver damage, because SAA expression was not induced by other hepatotoxic drugs such as acetaminophen, valproic acid, or metformin. Our in vitro studies showed that cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation was not a primary cause of the ritodrine-induced SAA increase. Instead, SAA expression was enhanced by indirect phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) mediated by interleukin-6. Therefore, our study provides a method for sensitive and early detection of hepatic injury, and may thus help preclude serious liver damage due to ritodrine use in preterm labor.

23643933|t|Induction of the liver cancer-down-regulated long noncoding RNA uc002mbe.2 mediates trichostatin-induced apoptosis of liver cancer cells.
23643933|a|Differential expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) plays critical roles in hepatocarcinogenesis. Considerable attention has focused on the antitumor effect of histone deacetylase inhibitor (Trichostatin A, TSA) as well as the coding gene expression-induced apoptosis of cancer cells. However, it is not known whether lncRNA has a role in TSA-induced apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The global expression of lncRNAs and coding genes was analyzed with the Human LncRNA Array V2.0 after 24h treatment. Expression was verified in cell lines and tissues by quantitative real-time PCR. The data showed that 4.8% (959) of lncRNA and 6.1% (1849) of protein coding gene were significantly differentially expressed. The differential expressions of lncRNA and protein coding genes had distinguishable hierarchical clustering expression profiling pattern. Among these differentially expressed lncRNAs, the greatest change was noted for uc002mbe.2, which had more than 300 folds induction upon TSA treatment. TSA selectively induced uc002mbe.2 in four studied HCC cell lines. Compared with normal human hepatocytes and adjacent noncancerous tissues, uc002mbe.2 expression level was significantly lower in the HCC cell lines and liver cancer tissues. The TSA-induced uc002mbe.2 expression was positively correlated with the apoptotic effect of TSA in HCC cells. In addition, knockdown the expression of uc002mbe.2 significantly reduced TSA-induced apoptosis of Huh7cells. Therefore, TSA-induced apoptosis of HCC cells is uc002mbe.2 dependent and reduced expression of uc002mbe.2 may be associated with liver carcinogenesis.

16965760|t|D-myo-inositol 1-phosphate as a surrogate of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-tris phosphate to monitor G protein-coupled receptor activation.
16965760|a|Phospholipase C beta (PLC-beta)-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activities traditionally are assessed by measuring Ca2+ triggered by D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), a PLC-beta hydrolysis product, or by measuring the production of inositol phosphate using cumbersome radioactive assays. A specific detection of IP3 production was also established using IP3 binding proteins. The short lifetime of IP3 makes this detection very challenging in measuring GPCR responses. Indeed, this IP3 rapidly enters the metabolic inositol phosphate cascade. It has been known for decades that lithium chloride (LiCl) leads to D-myo-inositol 1-phosphate accumulation on GPCR activation by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase, the final enzyme of the IP3 metabolic cascade. We show here that IP1 can be used as a surrogate of IP3 to monitor GPCR activation. We developed a novel homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay that correlates perfectly with existing methods and is easily amenable to high-throughput screening. The IP-One assay was validated on various GPCR models. It has the advantage over the traditional Ca2+ assay of allowing the measurement of inverse agonist activity as well as the analysis of PLC-beta activity in any nontransfected primary cultures. Finally, the high assay specificity for D-myo-inositol 1 monophosphate (IP1(1)) opens new possibilities in developing selective assays to study the functional roles of the various isoforms of inositol phosphates.

23435910|t|Effect of sinapic acid against dimethylnitrosamine-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats.
23435910|a|Sinapic acid is a member of the phenylpropanoid family and is abundant in cereals, nuts, oil seeds, and berries. It exhibits a wide range of pharmacological properties. In this study, we investigated the hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects of sinapic acid on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced chronic liver injury in rats. Sinapic acid remarkably prevented DMN-induced loss of body weight. This was accompanied by a significant increase in levels of serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and liver malondialdehyde content. Furthermore, sinapic acid reduced hepatic hydroxyproline content, which correlated with a reduction in the expression of type I collagen mRNA and histological analysis of collagen in liver tissue. Additionally, the expression of hepatic fibrosis-related factors such as a-smooth muscle actin and transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1), were reduced in rats treated with sinapic acid. Sinapic acid exhibited strong scavenging activity. In conclusion, we find that sinapic acid exhibits hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects against DMN-induced liver injury, most likely due to its antioxidant activities of scavenging radicals, its capacity to suppress TGF-b1 and its ability to attenuate activation of hepatic stellate cells. This suggests that sinapic acid is a potentially useful agent for the protection against liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.

23293129|t|Antigenotoxic potencies of a lichen species, Evernia prunastri.
23293129|a|In this article, the genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects of methanol extract of Evernia prunastri (Huds.) Willd. (MEP) were studied using WP2, Ames (TA1535 and TA1537) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test systems. The results obtained from bacterial test systems demonstrated that MEP has strong antimutagenic potencies on TA1537 and WP2 strains. The highest inhibition rates for MEP on TA1537 and WP2 strains were 37.70% and 69.70%, respectively. According to the SCE test system, MEP reduced the genotoxic effects of aflatoxin. In order to clarify the mechanism underlying the antigenotoxic effects of MEP, the antioxidants were determined. Cotreatments of 5, 10 and 20 ug/mL concentrations of MEP with aflatoxin B(1) decreased the frequencies of SCE and the malondialdehyde level and increased amount of superoxide dismutase, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase which were decreased by aflatoxin. The data obtained from this work have clearly shown that MEP has significant antigenotoxic effects which are thought to be partly due to the antioxidant activities and antioxidant inducing capability of MEP. This is the first report indicating the antigenotoxic activities of MEP against several mutagen agents such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, acridin and aflatoxin.

17369066|t|Metabolic derangement of methionine and folate metabolism in mice deficient in methionine synthase reductase.
17369066|a|Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is a metabolic derangement that is linked to the distribution of folate pools, which provide one-carbon units for biosynthesis of purines and thymidylate and for remethylation of homocysteine to form methionine. In humans, methionine synthase deficiency results in the accumulation of methyltetrahydrofolate at the expense of folate derivatives required for purine and thymidylate biosynthesis. Complete ablation of methionine synthase activity in mice results in embryonic lethality. Other mouse models for hyperhomocyst(e)inemia have normal or reduced levels of methyltetrahydrofolate and are not embryonic lethal, although they have decreased ratios of AdoMet/AdoHcy and impaired methylation. We have constructed a mouse model with a gene trap insertion in the Mtrr gene specifying methionine synthase reductase, an enzyme essential for the activity of methionine synthase. This model is a hypomorph, with reduced methionine synthase reductase activity, thus avoiding the lethality associated with the absence of methionine synthase activity. Mtrr(gt/gt) mice have increased plasma homocyst(e)ine, decreased plasma methionine, and increased tissue methyltetrahydrofolate. Unexpectedly, Mtrr(gt/gt) mice do not show decreases in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio in most tissues. The different metabolite profiles in the various genetic mouse models for hyperhomocyst(e)inemia may be useful in understanding biological effects of elevated homocyst(e)ine.

23561088|t|Maqui berry (Aristotelia chilensis) and the constituent delphinidin glycoside inhibit photoreceptor cell death induced by visible light.
23561088|a|The protective effects of maqui berry (Aristotelia chilensis) extract (MBE) and its major anthocyanins [delphinidin 3,5-O-diglucoside (D3G5G) and delphinidin 3-O-sambubioside-5-O-glucoside (D3S5G)] against light-induced murine photoreceptor cells (661W) death were evaluated. Viability of 661W after light treatment for 24h, assessed by the tetrazolium salt (WST-8) assay and Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining, was improved by addition of MBE, D3G5G, and D3S5G. Intracellular radical activation in 661W, evaluated using the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive probe 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2,7-dichlorodihydro fluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA), was reduced by MBE and its anthocyanins. The anti-apoptosis mechanism of MBE was evaluated by light-induced phosphorylation of p38. MBE significantly suppressed the light-induced phosphorylation of p38. These findings indicate that MBE and its anthocyanidins suppress the light-induced photoreceptor cell death by inhibiting ROS production, suggesting that the inhibition of phosphorylated-p38 may be involved in the underlying mechanism.

12375053|t|Effects of pentosan polysulfate sodium on the estrogen-induced pituitary prolactinoma in Fischer 344 rats.
12375053|a|The development of estrogen-induced pituitary prolactinoma in Fischer 344 (F344) rats is associated with enhanced neovascularization. This type of tumor is a rich source of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which possesses strong mitogenic and angiogenic properties. Pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) has been shown to exert antitumor activity by antagonizing the binding of bFGF to cell surface receptors. We have examined the effects of pentosan on tumor growth, hyperprolactinemia and angiogenesis in diethylstilbestrol-induced anterior pituitary adenoma in F344 rats. Chronic treatment with PPS did not cause any changes in the pituitary weight and serum prolactin concentration in comparison with untreated animals. The density of microvessels identified by CD-31 was also not affected by the tested drug. On the other hand, pentosan has been found to decrease cell proliferation evaluated by a number of PCNA-positive stained cell nuclei. Moreover, the TUNEL method has revealed an increased number of apoptotic bodies within the anterior pituitary after treatment with PPS. Despite the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity of pentosan, the drug failed to inhibit tumor growth. This fact might be due to the lack of antiangiogenic activity of PPS in this experimental design.

17575572|t|An investigation of the absolute configuration of the potent histamine H3 receptor antagonist GT-2331 using vibrational circular dichroism.
17575572|a|GT-2331 [(+)-1] is one of the most potent members of a class of chiral drug substances used to regulate the synthesis and release of histamine by the histamine H3 receptor, and as such, is an important biomarker for pharmaceutical companies conducting research in this field. In addition to overall structural features, the bioactivity of this molecule has also been found to be highly dependent on absolute stereochemistry, making the reliable assignment of this property a necessity. X-ray diffraction studies have provided conflicting data, leaving its three-dimensional structure uncertain. In view of this, its absolute configuration was investigated by vibrational circular dichroism. Results from this study provided independent assignment of this important molecule as the (1S,2S)-enantiomer.

23327794|t|Alkaloids from Microcos paniculata with cytotoxic and nicotinic receptor antagonistic activities.
23327794|a|Microcos paniculata is a large shrub or small tree that grows in several countries in South and Southeast Asia. In the present study, three new piperidine alkaloids, microgrewiapines A-C (1-3), as well as three known compounds, inclusive of microcosamine A (4), 7'-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-N-[4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]propenamide (5), and liriodenine (6), were isolated from cytotoxic fractions of the separate chloroform-soluble extracts of the stem bark, branches, and leaves of M. paniculata. Compounds 1-6 and 1a (microgrewiapine A 3-acetate) showed a range of cytotoxicity values against the HT-29 human colon cancer cell line. When evaluated for their effects on human a3b4 or a4b2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), several of these compounds were shown to be active as nAChR antagonists. As a result of this study, microgrewiapine A (1) was found to be a selective cytotoxic agent for colon cancer cells over normal colon cells and to exhibit nicotinic receptor antagonistic activity for both the ha3b4 and ha4b2 receptor subtypes.

7885191|t|Drosophila GABA-gated chloride channel: modified [3H]EBOB binding site associated with Ala-->Ser or Gly mutants of Rdl subunit.
7885191|a|The non-competitive blocker site of the GABA-gated chloride ion channel in normal susceptible strains of Drosophila melanogaster and simulans binds 4-n-[3H]propyl-4'-ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate ([3H]EBOB) at specific sites with KdS of 1.6-1.9 nM and BmaxS of 171-181 fmol/mg protein. This specific binding of [3H]EBOB is strongly inhibited by: a large number and variety of insecticidal channel blockers at 20 nM (lindane, alpha-endosulfan, dieldrin, 12-ketoendrin, fipronil, and a representative bicycloorthobenzoate and dithiane) or 200 nM (picrotoxinin); the insecticidal channel activators avermectin and moxidectin at 20 nM; muscimol at 30 microM and GABA at 300 microM. Cyclodiene resistance in D. melanogaster has been attributed to a mutation resulting in an Ala302-->Ser replacement in the Rdl GABA receptor subunit and in D. simulans to an homologous Ala-->Ser or Gly replacement. These mutations are shown here to greatly reduce [3H]EBOB binding, i.e. lower affinity and apparent number of binding sites. The Ala-->Ser replacement with both melanogaster and simulans almost always reduces the potency in inhibiting [3H]EBOB binding of each of eight channel blockers and of muscimol and GABA. The Ala-->Gly replacement in D. simulans is generally less effective than the Ala-->Ser modification in reducing sensitivity to the channel blockers and to muscimol and GABA. The channel activators avermectin and moxidectin usually retain their inhibitory potency in the Rdl subunit mutants. Thus, it appears that replacement of Ala by Ser generally modifies the non-competitive blocker site and its coupling to the GABA-recognition site with less effect on the channel activator site. In contrast, the Ala-->Gly replacement has less impact in protecting the chloride channel from the action of insecticidal blockers. Each of the resistant strains has the same level of resistance to the lethal action of the five channel blockers examined but none to avermectins and muscimol.

9551716|t|Characterization of binding sites of a new neurotensin receptor antagonist, [3H]SR 142948A, in the rat brain.
9551716|a|The present study describes the characterization of the binding properties and autoradiographic distribution of a new nonpeptide antagonist of neurotensin receptors, [3H]SR 142948A (2-[[5-(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-(4-(N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-methyl carbamoyl)-2-isopropylphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonyl]-amino]-ad amantane-2-carboxylic acid, hydrochloride), in the rat brain. The binding of [3H]SR 142948A in brain membrane homogenates was specific, time-dependent, reversible and saturable. [3H]SR 142948A bound to an apparently homogeneous population of sites, with a Kd of 3.5 nM and a Bmax value of 508 fmol/mg of protein, which was 80% higher than that observed in saturation experiments with [3H]neurotensin. [3H]SR 142948A binding was inhibited by SR 142948A, the related nonpeptide receptor antagonist, SR 48692 (2-[[1-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-5-(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole -3-carbonyl]amino]-adamantane-2-carboxylic acid) and neurotensin. Saturation and competition studies in the presence or absence of the histamine H1 receptor antagonist, levocabastine, revealed that [3H]SR 142948A bound with similar affinities to both the levocabastine-insensitive neurotensin NT1 receptors (20% of the total binding population) and the recently cloned levocabastine-sensitive neurotensin NT2 receptors (80% of the receptors) (Kd = 6.8 and 4.8 nM, respectively). The regional distribution of [3H]SR 142948A binding in the rat brain closely matched the distribution of [125I]neurotensin binding. In conclusion, these findings indicate that [3H]SR 142948A is a new potent antagonist radioligand which recognizes with high affinity both neurotensin NT1 and NT2 receptors and represents thus an excellent tool to study neurotensin receptors in the rat brain.

20185318|t|Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Inhibition of mammalian isoforms I-XIV with a series of natural product polyphenols and phenolic acids.
20185318|a|A series of phenolic acids and phenol natural products, such as p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, syringic acid, quercetin, and ellagic acid, were investigated for their inhibitory effects against the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1). All mammalian isozymes of human (h) or murine (m) origin hCA I-hCA XII, mCA XIII and hCA XIV were inhibited in the low micromolar or submicromolar range by these (poly)phenols (K(I)s in the range of 0.87-7.79 microM). p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was the best inhibitor of all isozymes (K(I)s of 0.87-35.4 microM) and the different isozymes showed very variable inhibition profiles with these derivatives. Phenols like the ones investigated here possess a CA inhibition mechanism distinct of that of the sulfonamides/sulfamates used clinically or the coumarins. Unlike the sulfonamides, which bind to the catalytic zinc ion, phenols are anchored at the Zn(II)-coordinated water molecule and bind more externally within the active site cavity, making contacts with various amino acid residues. As this is the region with the highest variability between the many CA isozymes found in mammals, this class of compounds may lead to isoform-selective inhibitors targeting just one or few of the medicinally relevant CAs.

23347547|t|Quercetin-loaded microcapsules ameliorate experimental colitis in mice by anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms.
23347547|a|Quercetin (1) is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant flavonoid. However, the oral administration of 1 did not lead to beneficial effects in experimental animal colitis models, which involve cytokines and oxidative stress. A possible explanation is that the absorption profile of 1 prevents its activity. Therefore, it was reasoned that the controlled release of 1 would improve its therapeutic effect. Thus, the therapeutic effect and mechanisms of 1-loaded microcapsules in acetic acid-induced colitis in mice were evaluated. Microcapsules were prepared using pectin/casein polymer and 1. The oral administration of 1-loaded microcapsules decreased neutrophil recruitment, attenuated histological alterations, and reduced macroscopical damage, edema, and IL-1b and IL-33 production in the colon samples. Microcapsules loaded with 1 also prevented the reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the antioxidant capacity of the colon. These preclinical data indicate that pectin/casein polymer microcapsules loaded with 1 improved the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of 1 compared to the nonencapsulated drug. Therefore, quercetin seems to be a promising active molecule in inflammatory bowel disease if provided with adequate controlled release.

22578098|t|Discovery and structural characterization of a phospholamban-binding cyclic peptide and design of novel inhibitors of phospholamban.
22578098|a|The interplay between cardiac sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)ATPase and phospholamban is a key regulating factor of contraction and relaxation in the cardiac muscle. In heart failure, aberrations in the inhibition of sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)ATPase by phospholamban are associated with anomalies in cardiac functions. In experimental heart failure models, modulation of the interaction between these two proteins has been shown to be a potential therapeutic approach. The aim of our research was to find molecules able to interfere with the inhibitory activity of phospholamban on sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)ATPase. For this purpose, a portion of phospholamban was synthesized and used as target for a phage-display peptide library screening. The cyclic peptide C-Y-W-E-L-E-W-L-P-C-A was found to bind to phospholamban (1-36) with high specificity. Its functional activity was tested in Ca(2+)uptake assays utilizing preparations from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. By synthesizing and testing a series of alanine point-mutated cyclic peptides, we identified which amino acid was important for the inhibition of the phospholamban function. The structures of active and inactive alanine-mutated cyclic peptides, and of phospholamban (1-36), were determined by NMR. This structure-activity analysis allowed building a model of phospholamban -cyclic peptide complex. Thereafter, a simple pharmacophore was defined and used for the design of small molecules. Finally, examples of such molecules were synthesized and characterized as phospholamban inhibitors.

23525167|t|NMR characterisation of dynamics in solvates and desolvates of formoterol fumarate.
23525167|a|Solid-state NMR is used to characterise dynamics in the ethanol solvate of the pharmaceutical material formoterol fumarate and its associated desolvate. Jump rates and activation barriers for dynamic processes such as phenyl ring rotation and methyl group rotational diffusion are derived from 1D-EXSY and (13)C spin-lattice relaxation times respectively. (2)H and (13)C spin-lattice relaxation times measured under magic-angle spinning conditions are used to show that the fumarate ion in the desolvate is undergoing small-amplitude motion on a frequency scale of 100s of MHz at ambient temperature with an activation parameter of about 32 kJ mol(-1). Exact calculations of relaxation times under MAS provide a simple and robust means to test motional models in cases where relaxation rate maxima are observed, including for systems where the crystal structure of the material is unknown.

23339678|t|Impact of ketorolac administration around ovarian stimulation on in vivo and in vitro fertilization and subsequent embryo development.
23339678|a|Abstract We performed this study to investigate the effect of ketorolac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) administration around ovarian stimulation on in vivo and in vitro fertilization process. Sixty-four female mice (ICR) were injected with ketorolac (0, 7.5, 15 and 30 ug/d) for 3 d starting from the day of eCG treatment. In experiment 1, 41 mice were triggered by hCG and then mated; two-cell embryos were obtained and in vitro development up to blastocyst was observed. In experiment 2, 23 mice were triggered by hCG and mature oocytes were collected; in vitro fertilization rate and subsequent embryo development up to blastocyst was recorded. In experiment 1, the blastocyst-forming rates per in vivo fertilized two-cell embryo showed an inverse relationship with a dosage of ketorolac (97.6%, 64.2%, 35.4% and 25.9%). In experiment 2, degenerated oocytes were frequently observed in a dose-dependent manner (4.3%, 22.9%, 22.4% and 75.0%). Lower fertilization rates were noted in all the three ketorolac-treating groups; blastocyst-forming rate was significantly lower in 30-ug-treating group when compared with the control group. Administration of ketorolac around ovarian stimulation significantly affects the development of in vivo fertilized embryo in a dose-dependent manner. High-dose ketorolac could result in a poor oocyte quality and decreased embryo developmental competence.

7986344|t|Folding pathway of guanidine-denatured disulfide-intact wild-type and mutant bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A.
7986344|a|The refolding kinetics of guanidine-denatured disulfide-intact bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) and its proline-42-to-alanine mutant (Pro42Ala) have been studied by monitoring tyrosine burial and 2'-cytidine monophosphate (2'CMP) inhibitor binding. The folding rate for wild-type RNase A is faster in the presence of the inhibitor 2'CMP than in its absence, indicating that the transition-state structure in the rate-determining step is stabilized by 2'CMP. The folding rate monitored by 2'CMP binding to the major slow-folding species of Pro42Ala RNase A is faster than the folding rate monitored by tyrosine burial; however, the folding rate monitored by inhibitor binding to the minor slow-folding species is decreased significantly over the folding rate monitored by tyrosine burial, indicating that the major and minor slow-folding species of Pro42Ala fold to the native state with different transition-state conformations in the rate-determining step.

16674097|t|Comparative proteomics of ovarian epithelial tumors.
16674097|a|We analyzed 12 ovarian epithelial tumors using 2D PAGE-based comparative proteomics to construct intra- and inter-tumoral distance map trees and to discover surrogate biomarkers indicative of an ovarian tumor. The analysis was performed after laser microdissection of 12 fresh-frozen tissue samples, including 4 serous, 5 mucinous, and 3 endometrioid tumors, with correlation with their histopathological characteristics. Ovarian epithelial tumors and normal tissues showed an apparent separation on the distance map tree. Mucinous carcinomas were closest to the normal group, whereas serous carcinomas were located furthest from the normal group. All mucinous tumors with aggressive histology were separated from the low malignant potential (LMP) group. The benign-looking cysts adjacent to the intraepithelial carcinoma (IEC) showed an expression pattern identical to that of the IEC area. The extent of change on the lineages leading to the mucinous and serous carcinoma was 1.98-fold different. The overall gene expression profiles of serous or endometrioid carcinomas appeared to be less affected by grade or stage than by histologic type. The potential candidate biomarkers screened in ovarian tumors and found to be significantly up-regulated in comparison to normal tissues were as follows: NM23, annexin-1, protein phosphatase-1, ferritin light chain, proteasome alpha-6, and NAGK (N-acetyl glucosamine kinase). In conclusion, ovarian mucinous tumors are distinct from other ovarian epithelial tumors. LMP mucinous tumors showing histologically aggressive features belong to mucinous carcinoma on the proteomic basis.

10446934|t|Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade modify the pressure-natriuresis relationship by additive mechanisms in rats with human renin and angiotensinogen genes.
10446934|a|The intrarenal factors responsible for hypertension in double-transgenic rats (dTGR) harboring human renin and human angiotensinogen genes are unclear. The pressure-natriuresis and -diuresis relationships in response to chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade were evaluated. Renal renin-angiotensin and nitric oxide (NO) system gene expression was also investigated. Six-week-old dTGR were treated for 3 wk with submaximal doses of cilazapril (10 mg/kg, orally) or losartan (10 mg/kg, orally) or with the drug combination. In untreated dTGR, pressure-natriuresis relationships were maximally shifted rightward by approximately 70 to 80 mmHg, and both renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR were markedly decreased. Submaximal cilazapril and losartan dosages both decreased systolic BP by 30 mmHg and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward by 25 to 30 mmHg. Cilazapril increased RBF and GFR to values observed in normotensive control animals but did not significantly affect fractional sodium excretion (FENa) or fractional water excretion (FEH2O) curves. In contrast, losartan had no significant effect on RBF or GFR but shifted the FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. The cilazapril and losartan combination completely normalized BP and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward more than did either drug alone. When cilazapril and losartan were administered at higher doses (30 mg/kg, orally), the two drugs equally shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward, by 50 mmHg. Both drugs increased RBF and GFR; however, only losartan shifted FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. Human and rat renin and angiotensinogen genes were downregulated in dTGR and were increased by losartan and cilazapril treatments, whereas no changes in the expression of rat ACE and AT1A receptor genes were observed. Endothelial NO synthase expression was increased by cilazapril but not by losartan. Neither inducible NO synthase nor neural NO synthase gene expression was affected by drug treatments. Therefore, submaximal ACE inhibition enhanced sodium excretion mainly by increasing RBF and GFR, whereas submaximal AT1 receptor blockade decreased tubular sodium and water reabsorption. The combination of the two drugs produced an additive effect. The ACE inhibitor effects may involve increased endothelial NO synthase expression, perhaps related to the inhibition of bradykinin degradation.

23354393|t|Bioactive microconstituents and antioxidant properties of wild edible mushrooms from the island of Lesvos, Greece.
23354393|a|Crude composition, fatty acids, sterols, total phenolic content (TPC), individual polyphenols and terpenic acids were determined in five wild edible mushrooms species (Lactarius deliciosus, Lactarius sanguifluus, Lactarius semisanguifluus, Russula delica, Suillus bellinii) from Lesvos Island, Greece. In addition, the DPPH scavenging capacity, the ferric ion reducing power (FRAP) and the ferrous ion chelating activity of mushroom methanolic extracts were assessed. Among sterols, ergosterol predominated at concentrations 9.2-18.0mg/100g fw. Total phenolic content of mushroom extracts ranged from 6.0 to 20.8mg GAE/100g fw. Up to 19 simple polyphenols were determined in mushrooms extracts, the more abundant being p-OH-benzoic acid, p-OH-phenylacetic acid, o-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and chrysin. In addition, the triterpenic acids oleanolic and ursolic were detected for the first time in mushrooms. All species exerted antioxidant activity and ferrous ion chelating capacity. Principal component analysis revealed good correlations between TPC, DPPH and FRAP but not with metal chelating activity. It seems that mushrooms polyphenols exert antiradical and reducing activities, but they are not strong metal chelators, the observed chelating ability being probably due to other classes of compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the bioactive microconstituents and antioxidant activity of wild Greek edible mushrooms.

3345199|t|Effects of some mono- and bisquaternary ammonium compounds on the reactivatability of soman-inhibited human acetylcholinesterase in vitro.
3345199|a|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibited by the organophosphate soman (1,2,2-trimethyl-propylmethylphosphonofluoridate) rapidly becomes resistant to reactivation by oximes due to dealkylation of the soman-enzyme complex. This reaction is called aging. The effect of the four mono- and bisquaternary ammonium compounds tetramethylammonium (TMA), hexamethonium, decamethonium and suxamethonium on the reactivatability of soman-inhibited, solubilized AChE from human erythrocytes was investigated in vitro. All compounds were reversible inhibitors of AChE; the respective dissociation constants and the type of inhibition exhibited considerable differences. The affinities to both the active and the allosteric site were considerably higher for suxamethonium (Kii 81.3 microM; Ki 15.9 microM) and decamethonium (Kii 15.4 microM; Ki 4.4 microM) than for TMA (Kii 1 mM; Ki 289.6 microM) and hexamethonium (Kii 4.5 mM; Ki 331.8 microM). The reactivation experiments were performed in a four-step procedure (soman-inhibition at 0 degree and pH 10, aging at 37 degrees and pH 7.3, reactivation by the oxime HI 6 at 37 degrees and pH 7.3 followed by AChE assay). After these four steps (total duration 55 min), AChE was inhibited by soman to 95-100%. HI 6 could reactivate about 20% of the inhibited enzyme. All effectors increased the AChE reactivatability by HI 6 when added before aging was started. The maximal increase in reactivatability was higher in the presence of 1.6 mM suxamethonium (+35.8%) and 150 microM decamethonium (+40%) than of 22 mM TMA (+22.5%) and 8.3 mM hexamethonium (+19.2%). If the effectors were added after 5 min of aging they increased the activity of soman-inhibited AChE, but to a considerably smaller extent than HI 6. A good correlation of the respective Kii values and the effective concentrations of these drugs was observed, indicating that an allosteric binding site of AChE might be involved in the protective effect of these drugs.

10931813|t|Effects of a K(+) channel opener to reduce transmural dispersion of repolarization and prevent torsade de pointes in LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3 models of the long-QT syndrome.
10931813|a|BACKGROUND: This study examines the effects of nicorandil, a K(+) channel opener, on transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP) under conditions mimicking the LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3 forms of the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Transmembrane action potentials of epicardial, M, and endocardial cells were recorded simultaneously from an arterially perfused wedge of canine left ventricle together with a transmural ECG. Chromanol 293B (30 micromol/L) was used to block I(Ks) (LQT1 model). Isoproterenol (50 to 100 nmol/L) was used to mimic an increase in beta-adrenergic tone, d-sotalol (100 micromol/L) to block I(Kr) (LQT2 model), and ATX-II (20 nmol/L) to augment late I(Na) (LQT3 model). Isoproterenol+chromanol 293B, d-sotalol, and ATX-II produced preferential prolongation of the action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) of the M cell, an increase of TDR, and spontaneous as well as stimulation-induced TdP (LQT1, 3/6; LQT2, 3/6; LQT3, 5/6). Nicorandil (2 to 20 micromol/L) abbreviated the QT interval and APD(90) of the 3 cell types in the 3 models. High concentrations (10 to 20 micromol/L) completely reversed the effects of 293B+/-isoproterenol and those of d-sotalol to increase APD(90) and TDR and to induce TdP in LQT1 and LQT2 models. Nicorandil 20 micromol/L reversed only 50% of the effect of ATX-II and failed to completely suppress TdP in the LQT3 model (5/6 to 3/6). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that K(+) channel openers may be capable of abbreviating the long QT interval, reducing TDR, and preventing spontaneous and stimulation-induced TdP when congenital or acquired LQTS is secondary to reduced I(Kr) or I(Ks) but less so when it is due to augmented late I(Na).

16784786|t|Cell biology of molybdenum.
16784786|a|The transition element molybdenum (Mo) is of essential importance for (nearly) all biological systems as it is required by enzymes catalyzing diverse key reactions in the global carbon, sulfur and nitrogen metabolism. The metal itself is biologically inactive unless it is complexed by a special cofactor. With the exception of bacterial nitrogenase, where Mo is a constituent of the FeMo-cofactor, Mo is bound to a pterin, thus forming the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) which is the active compound at the catalytic site of all other Mo-enzymes. In eukaryotes, the most prominent Mo-enzymes are (1) sulfite oxidase, which catalyzes the final step in the degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids and is involved in detoxifying excess sulfite, (2) xanthine dehydrogenase, which is involved in purine catabolism and reactive oxygen production, (3) aldehyde oxidase, which oxidizes a variety of aldehydes and is essential for the biosynthesis of the phytohormone abscisic acid, and in autotrophic organisms also (4) nitrate reductase, which catalyzes the key step in inorganic nitrogen assimilation. All Mo-enzymes, except plant sulfite oxidase, need at least one more redox active center, many of them involving iron in electron transfer. The biosynthesis of Moco involves the complex interaction of six proteins and is a process of four steps, which also includes iron as well as copper in an indispensable way. Moco as released after synthesis is likely to be distributed to the apoproteins of Mo-enzymes by putative Moco-carrier proteins. Xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase, but not sulfite oxidase and nitrate reductase, require the post-translational sulfuration of their Mo-site for becoming active. This final maturation step is catalyzed by a Moco-sulfurase enzyme, which mobilizes sulfur from l-cysteine in a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent manner as typical for cysteine desulfurases.

12897749|t|Blockade of LTC4 synthesis caused by additive inhibition of gIV-PLA2 phosphorylation: Effect of salmeterol and PDE4 inhibition in human eosinophils.
12897749|a|BACKGROUND: Prior investigations have demonstrated that beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation is ineffective in inhibiting synthesis of eicosanoids in human eosinophils. This effect has been postulated to relate to density or structural differences in the beta(2)-adrenoceptor or its coupled G-protein. However, recent reports indicate that cAMP-specific PDE4 activity in eosinophils is 10-fold that of other inflammatory cells. We postulated that selective blockade of PDE4 in eosinophils would unmask the inhibitory effect of beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation and that this inhibition would result from decreased phosphor-ylation of cytosolic group IV-PLA(2) (gIV-PLA(2)). OBJECTIVE: To determine (a) whether PDE4 inhibition alone with rolipram blocked secretions of arachidonic acid (AA) and leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) caused by activation of eosinophils with formyl-met-leu-phe plus cytochalasin B (FMLP/B), (b) to determine if PDE4 inhibition plus beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist act additively to augment endogenous cAMP concentration, and (c) to determine the mechanism by which additive inhibition of AA and LTC(4) synthesis is regulated by cAMP. METHODS: Human eosinophils were pretreated with buffer, salmeterol or rolipram (singly or combination) before FMLP/B activation. Release of AA and LTC(4), intracellular cAMP concentration, and phosphorylation and activation of gIV-PLA(2) were determined. RESULTS: Rolipram unmasked the inhibitory effect of beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation with salmeterol and significantly attenuated the stimulated release of AA and subsequent LTC(4). Inhibition corresponded to increased cAMP production caused by rolipram alone or rolipram plus salmeterol and blocked proportionately the phosphorylation and activation of gIV-PLA(2) in FMLP/B-activated eosinophils. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of PDE4 by rolipram unmasks beta(2)-adrenergic blockade of LTC(4) synthesis caused by FMLP/B.

23060524|t|TLR4 antagonist reduces early-stage atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.
23060524|a|Although it has been reported that deficiency of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is associated with reduced atherosclerosis in atherosclerosis-prone mice and attenuated pro-inflammatory state in diabetic mice, it remains undetermined whether treatment with a TLR4 antagonist reduces atherosclerosis in nondiabetic or diabetic mice that have TLR4 expression. In this study, we determined the effect of Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipopolysaccharide (Rs-LPS), an established TLR4 antagonist, on early-stage atherosclerosis in nondiabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe(-/-)) mice. Analysis of atherosclerotic lesions of both en face aortas and cross sections of aortic roots showed that administration of Rs-LPS in 14-week-old diabetic Apoe(-/-) mice for 10 weeks significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions. Although atherosclerotic lesions in nondiabetic Apoe(-/-) mice appeared to be decreased by Rs-LPS treatment, the difference was not statistically significant. Metabolic study showed that Rs-LPS significantly lowered serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in nondiabetic mice but not in diabetic mice. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry studies showed that Rs-LPS inhibited the expression of interleukin 6 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 and reduced the content of monocytes and macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. Taken together, this study demonstrated for the first time that TLR4 antagonist inhibited vascular inflammation and atherogenesis in diabetic Apoe(-/-) mice and lowered serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in nondiabetic Apoe(-/-) mice.

11264758|t|Clinical effects of pranlukast, an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist, in mild-to-moderate asthma: a 4 week randomized multicentre controlled trial.
11264758|a|OBJECTIVE: Leukotriene antagonists are increasingly used in asthma management. Pranlukast is a new, orally active, selective inhibitor of CysLt1 leukotriene receptor. The present clinical trial was performed to study the effect and safety of pranlukast in mild-to-moderate asthma. METHODOLOGY: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was performed in eight medical centres in Korea. Mild-to-moderate asthma patients who had been treated with beta2-agonists and/or inhaled corticosteroids were studied. The patients' symptoms were evaluated by asthma diary and twice-daily peak flow monitoring. RESULTS: Of the 206 patients enrolled, 197 were eligible for analysis. The pranlukast group (n = 98) showed statistically significant improvement in asthma symptoms, including asthma attack rate, daily living score, and morning and evening asthma scores. Pranlukast significantly reduced the consumption of beta2-agonist. Compared with the placebo group, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were not significantly higher in the pranlukast group. Morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) were significantly increased after pranlukast treatment at weeks 2 and 4 (380.8 +/- 10.1 L/min at baseline, 394.5 +/- 10.1 at week 2, 396.3 +/- 10.4 at week 4). There were no serious adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: Pranlukast, an oral leukotriene antagonist, was well tolerated and was effective for the management of mild-to-moderate asthma.

17382376|t|Histamine H1 receptor involvement in prepulse inhibition and memory function: relevance for the antipsychotic actions of clozapine.
17382376|a|Histamine H(1) blockade is one of the more prominent actions of the multi-receptor acting antipsychotic clozapine. It is currently not known how much this H(1) antagonism of clozapine contributes to the therapeutic or adverse side effects of clozapine. The current studies with Sprague-Dawley rats were conducted to determine the participation of histaminergic H(1) receptor subtype in sensorimotor plasticity and memory function affected by clozapine using tests of prepulse inhibition (PPI) and radial-arm maze choice accuracy. The PPI impairment caused by the glutamate antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) was significantly attenuated by clozapine. In the current project, we found that the selective H(1) antagonist pyrilamine also reversed the dizocilpine-induced impairment in PPI of tactile startle with an auditory prepulse. In the radial-arm maze (RAM), pyrilamine, like clozapine, impaired working memory and caused a significant dose-related slowing of response. Pyrilamine, however, decreased the number of reference memory errors. We have previously shown that nicotine effectively attenuates the clozapine-induced working memory impairment, but in the current study, nicotine did not significantly alter the effects of pyrilamine on the RAM. In summary, the therapeutic effect of clozapine in reversing PPI impairment was mimicked by the H(1) antagonist pyrilamine, while pyrilamine had a mixed effect on cognition. Pyrilamine impaired working memory but improved reference memory in rats. Thus, H(1) antagonism seems to play a role in part of the beneficial actions of antipsychotics, such as clozapine.

20230007|t|Effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids and glucocorticoids on the kinetics of hAR and hGR nucleocytoplasmic translocation.
20230007|a|Although the qualitative nucleocytoplasmic transport of nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) has been studied, there is little documentation of the cellular kinetics of this transport. Here, translocation studies using the human androgen receptor (hAR) and the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) were performed to aid in identifying the mechanism by which anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) were activating hAR and potentially interacting with hGR and how glucocorticoid ligands were interacting with the hGR and hAR. The real-time analysis of EGFP-labeled hAR and hGR ligand-induced cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation was performed using fluorescence microscopy to better understand the action of these NHRs in a physiologically relevant cell-based model. After transient transfection, the hAR and hGR individually translocate as expected (i.e., transport is ligand-induced and dose-dependent) in this model biological system. Testosterone (TEST) had the fastest translocation rate for the hAR of 0.0525 min(-1). The other endogenous steroids, androstenedione (ANE) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), had considerably lower hAR transport rates. The rates of hAR transport for the exogenous steroids methyltrienelone (MET), nandrolone (NAN), and oxandrolone (OXA) are lower than that of testosterone and similar to those of the endogenous steroids ANE and DHT. The hGR transport rates for cortisol (COR) and dexamethasone (DEX) are also presented. The synthetic GC, DEX, had a more rapid translocation rate (0.1599 min(-1)) at the highest dose of 100 nM compared to the endogenous GC COR (0.0431 min(-1)). The data obtained agrees with the existing qualitative data and adds an important ligand-dependent kinetic component to hAR and hGR transport. These kinetic data can aid our understanding of NHR action and interaction with other regulatory proteins, and can be useful in the development of new therapies.

22968082|t|Influence of stimulant-induced hyperactivity on social approach in the BTBR mouse model of autism.
22968082|a|Translational research is needed to discover pharmacological targets and treatments for the diagnostic behavioral domains of autism spectrum disorders. Animal models with phenotypic relevance to diagnostic criteria offer clear experimental strategies to test the efficacy and safety of novel treatments. Antagonists of mGluR5 receptors are in clinical trials for Fragile X syndrome and under investigation for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. However, in preclinical studies of mGluR5 compounds tested in our laboratory and others, increased locomotion following mGluR5 modulation has been observed. Understanding the influence of general activity on sociability and repetitive behaviors will increase the accuracy of interpretations of positive outcomes measured from pharmacological treatment that produces locomotor activating or sedating effects. In the present studies, dose-response curves for d-amphetamine (AMPH)-induced hyperlocomotion were similar in standard B6 mice and in the BTBR mouse model of autism. AMPH produced significant, robust reductions in the high level of repetitive self-grooming that characterizes BTBR, and also reduced the low baseline grooming in B6, indicating that AMPH-induced hyperlocomotion competes with time spent engaged in self-grooming. We then tested AMPH in B6 and BTBR on the 3-chambered social approach task. One component of sociability, the time spent in the chamber with the novel mouse, in B6 mice was reduced, while the sniffing time component of sociability in BTBR mice was enhanced. This finding replicated across multiple cohorts treated with AMPH and saline vehicle. In-depth analysis revealed that AMPH increased the number and decreased the duration of sniffing bouts in BTBR, suggesting BTBR treated with AMPH mostly engaged in brief sniffs rather than true social interactions with the novel mouse during the social approach task. Our data suggest that compounds with stimulant properties may have some direct benefits on reducing repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders, particularly in the subset of autistic individuals with hyperactivity. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Neurodevelopmental Disorders'.

23357629|t|Design, synthesis, characterization and anti-inflammatory evaluation of novel pyrazole amalgamated flavones.
23357629|a|A series of novel pyrazole amalgamated flavones has been designed and synthesized from 1-methyl-5-(2,4,6-trimethoxy-phenyl)-1H-pyrazole 6. The structures of regioisomers 6 and 7 were resolved by 2D (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HSQC and (1)H-(13)C HMBC experiments. The newly synthesized compounds were tested for their in vitro COX inhibition and in vivo carrageenan induced hind paw edema in rats and acetic acid induced vascular permeability in mice. Although the compounds have inhibitory profile against both COX-1 and COX-2, some of the compounds are found to be selective against COX-2, supported by inhibition of paw edema and vascular permeability. Docking studies were also carried out to determine the structural features which sway the anti-inflammatory activity of the tested compounds. The keto and phenolic -OH are major factors that are prominently involved in interaction with COX-2 active site.

23172777|t|3D-QSAR-assisted drug design: identification of a potent quinazoline-based Aurora kinase inhibitor.
23172777|a|We describe the 3D-QSAR-assisted design of an Aurora kinase A inhibitor with improved physicochemical properties, in vitro activity, and in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles over those of the initial lead. Three different 3D-QSAR models were built and validated by using a set of 66 pyrazole (Model I) and furanopyrimidine (Model II) compounds with IC(50) values toward Aurora kinase A ranging from 33 nM to 10.5 uM. The best 3D-QSAR model, Model III, constructed with 24 training set compounds from both series, showed robustness (r(2) (CV) =0.54 and 0.52 for CoMFA and CoMSIA, respectively) and superior predictive capacity for 42 test set compounds (R(2) (pred) =0.52 and 0.67, CoMFA and CoMSIA). Superimposition of CoMFA and CoMSIA Model III over the crystal structure of Aurora kinase A suggests the potential to improve the activity of the ligands by decreasing the steric clash with Val147 and Leu139 and by increasing hydrophobic contact with Leu139 and Gly216 residues in the solvent-exposed region of the enzyme. Based on these suggestions, the rational redesign of furanopyrimidine 24 (clog P=7.41; Aurora A IC(50) =43 nM; HCT-116 IC(50) =400 nM) led to the identification of quinazoline 67 (clog P=5.28; Aurora A IC(50) =25 nM; HCT-116 IC(50) =23 nM). Rat in vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed that 67 has better systemic exposure after i.v. administration than 24, and holds potential for further development.

23402628|t|Oxidation of tertiary amine-derivatized surfaces to control protein adhesion.
23402628|a|Selective oxidation of w-tertiary amine self-assembled thiol monolayers to tertiary amine N-oxides is shown to transform the adhesion of model proteins lysozyme and fibrinogen upon them. Efficient preparation of both secondary and tertiary linker amides as judged by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water droplet contact angle was achieved with an improved amide bond formation on gold quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors using 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl hexafluorophosphate methanaminium uronium (HATU). Oxidation with hydrogen peroxide was similarly assessed, and adhesion of lysozyme and fibrinogen from phosphate buffered saline was then assayed by QCM and imaged by AFM. Tertiary amine-functionalized sensors adsorbed multilayers of aggregated lysozyme, whereas tertiary amine N-oxides and triethylene glycol-terminated monolayers are consistent with small protein aggregates. The surface containing a dimethylamine N-oxide headgroup and ethyl secondary amide linker showed the largest difference in adsorption of both proteins. Oxidation of tertiary amine decorated surfaces therefore holds the potential for selective deposition of proteins and cells through masking and other patterning techniques.

15198222|t|Determination of expression of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 isozymes in canine tissues and their differential sensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
15198222|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cyclooxygenase isozyme distribution in tissues from dogs and determine the differential sensitivity of canine cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 isozymes to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). SAMPLE POPULATION: Canine tissue samples (stomach, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, colon, spleen, cerebral cortex, lung, ovary, kidney, and liver) were obtained from 2 dogs for northern and western blot analyses, and blood for whole blood COX assays was obtained from 15 dogs. PROCEDURE: 11 NSAIDs were evaluated to determine their COX-2 selectivity in whole blood assays. The concentrations of the drug needed to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity (IC50) were then calculated for comparison. Expression and tissue distribution of COX isozymes were determined by northern and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Aspirin, diclofenac, indomethacin, ketoprofen, meclofenamic acid, and piroxicam had little selectivity toward COX isozymes, whereas NS398, carprofen, tolfenamic acid, nimesulide, and etodolac had more than 5 times greater preference for inhibiting COX-2 than COX-1. All canine tissues examined, including those from the gastrointestinal tract, coexpressed COX-1 and -2 mRNA, although protein expression was observed only for COX-1. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Canine COX-2 was selectively inhibited by etodolac, nimesulide, and NS398; tolfenamic acid and carprofen also appeared to be preferential COX-2 inhibitors in dogs. The roles of COX-1 as a constitutive housekeeping enzyme and COX-2 as a proinflammatory inducible enzyme (as determined in humans) appear to apply to dogs; therefore, COX-2-selective inhibitors should prove useful in reducing the adverse effects associated with nonselective NSAIDs.

15837926|t|Crystal structure of prostate-specific membrane antigen, a tumor marker and peptidase.
15837926|a|Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and nonprostatic solid tumor neovasculature and is a target for anticancer imaging and therapeutic agents. PSMA acts as a glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) on small molecule substrates, including folate, the anticancer drug methotrexate, and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.

16424790|t|Comparison of captopril and enalapril to study the role of the sulfhydryl-group in improvement of endothelial dysfunction with ACE inhibitors in high dieted methionine mice.
16424790|a|To examine the role of sulfhydryl (-SH) group in improvement of endothelial dysfunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in experimental high dose of methionine dieted rats. We compared the effects of Captopril (an ACE inhibitor with -SH group), enalapril (an ACE-inhibitor without -SH group), N-acetylcysteine (only -SH group not ACE inhibitor) on endothelial dysfunction injured by methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into seven groups: control group, L-methionine group, low dose Captopril (15 mg/kg), middle dose Captopril (30 mg/kg), high dose Captopril (45 mg/kg), enalapril (20 mg/kg), N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg); control group were intragastric gavaged by water and others groups were intragastric gavaged by L-methionine and drugs in water one time every day. Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR), sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced endothelium-independent relaxation of aortic rings were examined. Paraoxonase1 (PON1) and ACE activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum were analyzed. It was found that a single intragastric gavage by L-methionine resulted in inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation, markedly increased the serum level of malondialdehyde and decreased the activity of PON1 and SOD, similarly decreased the level of NO in the serum; but had no effects on endothelium-independent relaxation and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity compared with the control group. Given the treatment with three doses of Captopril (15 approximately 45 mg/kg) markedly attenuated inhibition of vasodilator responses to ACh, and eliminated the increased level of malondialdehyde, the decreased level of NO, activity of PON1 and SOD in serum by single intragastric gavaged L-methionine. However, there were some significant differences among Captopril (30 mg/kg or 45 mg/kg), enalapril (20 mg/kg), and N-acetylcysteine particular in the activity of PON1 and ACE. These results suggested that Captopril can protect the vascular endothelium against the damages induced by L-methionine in rats, and the beneficial effects of Captopril may be related to attenuating the decrease in PON1 activity and NO levels. Furthermore, this protective effect may be concerned with the sulfhydryl group.

1738111|t|Characterization of 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptors in rat spinal cord via [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding and inhibition of [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine release.
1738111|a|The aim of the present study in rat spinal cord synaptosomes was to compare the pharmacological characteristics of the serotonin (5-HT)1B receptor defined by [125I]iodocyanopindolol [( 125I] ICYP) binding and the 5-HT autoreceptor defined by inhibition of [3H]-5-HT release. In Percoll gradient Fractions 3 and 4 of spinal cord synaptosomes, a single saturable binding site for [125I]ICYP with a maximum binding of 70 and 134 fmol/mg, respectively, was demonstrated in the presence of 30 microM isoproterenol. The Kd of 0.16 nM did not vary between fractions. Competition for [125I]ICYP binding by various 5-HT agonists and antagonists also indicated a single site model based on a Hill coefficient of approximately 1.0. The most potent compounds at displacing [125I]ICYP binding were RU 24969 (5-methoxy-3-[1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl]-1H-indole), 5-carboxyamidotryptamine HCl, 5-methoxytryptamine, 5-HT and CGS 12066B (7-trifluoromethyl-4(4 methyl-1-pyrolo[1,2-a]-quinoxaline malate). [125I]ICYP binding was not altered by compounds with activity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 or alpha-2 receptor sites. Similar to the pharmacological characteristics of the 5HT1B site defined by [125I]ICYP, compounds most active at inhibiting 15 mM K(+)-stimulated release of [3H]-5-HT were RU24969 = 5-carboxyamidotryptamine HCl = CGS 12066B greater than 5-methoxytryptamine greater than 5-HT. Compounds with activity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, 5-HT2 or 5-HT3 sites were inactive. A correlation analysis of selective 5-HT1B compounds comparing the pKD for displacement of [125I]ICYP vs. the IC50 for inhibition of [3H]-5-HT release demonstrated the pharmacological similarity of the presynaptic inhibitory 5-HT autoreceptor and the 5-HT receptor site defined by [125I]ICYP binding in spinal cord synaptosomes (r = 0.791, P = .0193). Although [125I]ICYP binding was unaltered, alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine, norepinephrine and UK 14304 [5-bromo-6-[2-imidazolin-2-ylamino]-quinoxaline) as well as the alpha-2 antagonists rauwolscine and yohimbine also decreased the K(+)-stimulated release of [3H]-5-HT and phentolamine, an alpha-2 antagonist increased release. The action of these alpha-2 compounds to alter [3H]-5-HT release suggests the presence of heteroreceptors localized on 5-HT terminals in the spinal cord. These results point out that [125I]ICYP identifies the 5-HT1B receptor, and affinity of compounds for this site predicts action at the 5-HT1B autoreceptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

9008235|t|Activation of cytoprotective prostaglandin synthase-1 by minoxidil as a possible explanation for its hair growth-stimulating effect.
9008235|a|Data from the literature indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as indomethacin, naproxen, piroxicam, or ibuprofen, induce hair loss in vivo. These NSAIDs are well-known inhibitors of both the cytoprotective isoform of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1 (PGHS-1) and of the inducible form (PGHS-2). By immunohistochemical staining, we found that PGHS-1 is the main isoform present in the dermal papilla from normal human hair follicle (either anagen or catagen), whereas PGHS-2 was only faintly and exclusively expressed in anagen dermal papilla. Thus, PGHS-1 might be the primary target of the hair growth-inhibitory effects of NSAIDs. We thus speculated that activation of PGHS-1 might be a mechanism by which minoxidil (2,4-diamino-6-piperidinopyrimidine-3-oxyde) stimulates hair growth in vivo. We demonstrate here that minoxidil is a potent activator of purified PGHS-1 (AC50 = 80 microM), as assayed by oxygen consumption and PGE2 production. This activation was also evidenced by increased PGE2 production by BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts and by human dermal papilla fibroblasts in culture. Our findings suggest that minoxidil and its derivatives may have a cytoprotective activity in vivo and that more potent second-generation hair growth-promoting drugs might be designed, based on this mechanism.

16324695|t|Protein kinase C potentiates homologous desensitization of the beta2-adrenoceptor in bovine tracheal smooth muscle.
16324695|a|Preincubation (30 min) of bovine tracheal smooth muscle with various concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 microM) of fenoterol decreased isoprenaline-induced maximal relaxation (E(max)) of methacholine-contracted preparations in a concentration dependent fashion, indicating desensitization of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor. Preincubation with 1 microM of the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused a small but significant decrease in isoprenaline-induced E(max), indicating activated PKC-mediated heterologous beta(2)-adrenoceptor desensitization. To investigate the capacity of activated PKC to regulate homologous desensitization, we incubated the smooth muscle strips with the combination of both 1 microM PMA and 1 microM fenoterol. This combined treatment synergistically decreased the isoprenaline-induced maximal relaxation, as compared to the individual effects of PMA and fenoterol alone, indicating a common pathway for heterologous and homologous desensitization. Moreover, the specific PKC-inhibitor 2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl) maleimide (GF 109203X) markedly increased the potency and E(max) of isoprenaline for all conditions used, including control conditions, and the synergistic effects of PMA and fenoterol were completely prevented. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that homologous desensitization of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor can be enhanced by PKC activation. For the first time we have provided evidence that this concept is functionally operative in airway smooth muscle, and it may explain the reduced bronchodilator response to beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists in patients with asthma during a severe exacerbation.

16434489|t|Dasatinib (BMS-354825) inhibits KITD816V, an imatinib-resistant activating mutation that triggers neoplastic growth in most patients with systemic mastocytosis.
16434489|a|Mastocytosis is associated with an activating mutation in the KIT oncoprotein (KITD816V) that results in autophosphorylation of the KIT receptor in a ligand-independent manner. This mutation is inherently resistant to imatinib and, to date, there remains no effective curative therapy for systemic mastocytosis associated with KITD816V. Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a novel orally bioavailable SRC/ABL inhibitor that has activity against multiple imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL isoforms in vitro that is presently showing considerable promise in early-phase clinical trials of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that high nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib can be achieved safely in humans. In this study, we demonstrate significant inhibitory activity of dasatinib against both wild-type KIT and the KITD816V mutation in the nanomolar range in in vitro and cell-based kinase assays. Additionally, dasatinib leads to growth inhibition of a KITD816V-harboring human masto-cytosis cell line. Significantly, dasatinib selectively kills primary neoplastic bone marrow mast cells from patients with systemic mastocytosis while sparing other hematopoietic cells. Computer modeling suggests that the KITD816V mutation destabilizes the inactive conformation of the KIT activation loop to which imatinib binds, but it is not predicted to impair binding of KIT by dasatinib. Based upon our results, further evaluation of dasatinib for the treatment of systemic masto-cytosis in clinical trials is warranted.

23396144|t|Protective effect of Codium fragile against UVB-induced pro-inflammatory and oxidative damages in HaCaT cells and BALB/c mice.
23396144|a|Acute exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes pro-inflammatory responses via diverse mechanisms including oxidative stress. Codium fragile is a green alga of Codiales family and has been reported to exhibit anti-edema, anti-allergic, anti-protozoal and anti-mycobacterial activities. In this study, we have investigated a novel anti-inflammatory potential of C. fragile using in vitro cell culture as well as in vivo animal models. In HaCaT cells, buthanol and ethylacetate fractions of 80% methanol C. fragile extract (CFB or CFE) and a single compound, clerosterol (CLS) isolated from CFE attenuated UVB (60mJ/cm(2))-induced cytotoxicity and reduced expression of pro-inflammatory proteins including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF- a). Moreover, CFB, CFE and CLS effectively suppressed UVB-induced production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO). In another experiment, topical application of CFB, CFE or CLS prior to UVB irradiation (200mJ/cm(2)) on BALB/c mice, inhibited the UVB-elevated protein levels of COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-a. Furthermore, CFB, CFE and CLS suppressed oxidative damages caused by UVB irradiation for example lipid peroxidation and/or protein carbonylation, which seemed to be mediated by up-regulation of antioxidant defense enzymes. These results suggest that C. fragile could be an effective therapeutic agent providing protection against UVB-induced inflammatory and oxidative skin damages.

15991937|t|Losartan: a selective angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist for the treatment of heart failure.
15991937|a|Losartan (COZAAR) is the prototype of a new class of potent and selective angiotensin II (AII) type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists with the largest published preclinical and clinical data base. Since all of the AII antagonists are selective for the AT(1) receptor, these drugs should exhibit similar cardiovascular effects. However, since the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles of these agents and their degree of affinity for the AT(1) receptor differ, it is likely that differences in clinical profiles between these drugs exist and will require investigation. Losartan (parent compound), has moderate affinity for the AT(1) receptor (competitive inhibition). Losartan is well-absorbed orally as an active drug and is rapidly converted via oxidation in the human liver to a more potent metabolite (designated E3174) with an affinity 20- to 30-times greater for the AT(1) receptor (non-competitive inhibition). E3174 has a half-life of 6 - 9 h; elimination is via renal and hepatic routes. Antihypertensive and, in heart failure patients, haemodynamic activity is observed over a 24 h period with once daily dosing. Over 6 million patients have been treated for hypertension with continued excellent tolerability. Clinical experience in heart failure is growing, and recent data suggest an improved survival with losartan versus captopril, a drug from the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor class with proven benefit in this population. The current comprehensive losartan clinical end-point programme (4 large scale morbidity/mortality trials) should provide evidence regarding the efficacy of direct blockade of the AT(1) receptor with losartan compared to standard therapy: 1) The Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study - ELITE II, 2) The Losartan Post-Myocardial Infarction Survival Study - OPTIMAAL, 3) The Losartan Hypertension Survival Study - LIFE and 4) The Losartan Renal Protection Study - RENAAL.

23164921|t|Catalpol inhibits LPS plus IFN-g-induced inflammatory response in astrocytes primary cultures.
23164921|a|A large body of evidence suggests that the inflammatory reaction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous studies described the neuroprotective effects of catalpol in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory models, in which catalpol was shown to prevent mesencephalic neuron death and ameliorate cognitive ability animals. To further investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanism of catalpol, astrocytes were pretreated with low (0.1mM) and high dose (0.5mM) catalpol for 1h prior to LPS plus interferon-g stimulation. Biochemical analyses showed that NO and ROS production and iNOS activity were significantly reduced by catalpol. Data at transcriptional level also demonstrated that catalpol potently attenuated gene expressions involved in inflammation, such as iNOS, COX-2 and TLR4. In addition, our exploration further revealed that the suppressive action of catalpol on inflammation was mediated via inhibiting nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation. Collectively, these results suggest that catalpol can exert inhibitory effects on the inflammatory reaction in astrocytes and that inactivation of NF-kB could be the major determinant for its anti-inflammatory mechanism. Therefore, catalpol may potentially be a highly effective therapeutic agent in treating neurodegenerative diseases associated with inflammation.

18974361|t|Molecular pharmacology of human Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels: block by antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics, and their analogs.
18974361|a|Antihypertensive drugs of the "calcium channel blocker" or "calcium antagonist" class have been used to establish the physiological role of L-type Ca(2+) channels in vascular smooth muscle. In contrast, there has been limited progress on the pharmacology T-type Ca(2+) channels. T-type channels play a role in cardiac pacemaking, aldosterone secretion, and renal hemodynamics, leading to the hypothesis that mixed T- and L-type blockers may have therapeutic advantages over selective L-type blockers. The goal of this study was to identify compounds that block the Ca(v)3.2 T-type channel with high affinity, focusing on two classes of compounds: phenylalkylamines (e.g., mibefradil) and dihydropyridines (e.g., efonidipine). Compounds were tested using a validated Ca(2+) influx assay into a cell line expressing recombinant Ca(v)3.2 channels. This study identified four clinically approved antihypertensive drugs (efonidipine, felodipine, isradipine, and nitrendipine) as potent T-channel blockers (IC(50) < 3 microM). In contrast, other widely prescribed dihydropyridines, such as amlodipine and nifedipine, were 10-fold less potent, making them a more appropriate choice in research studies on the role of L-type currents. In summary, the present results support the notion that many available antihypertensive drugs block a substantial fraction of T-current at therapeutically relevant concentrations, contributing to their mechanism of action.

23111283|t|Toosendanin induces apoptosis through suppression of JNK signaling pathway in HL-60 cells.
23111283|a|Toosendanin (TSN), a triterpenoid isolated from Melia toosendan Sieb. et Zucc., has been found to suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells. However, the mechanism how TSN induces apoptosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effects of TSN on the growth, cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and the involved signaling pathway in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Proliferation of HL-60 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with the IC(50 (48 h)) of 28 ng/mL. The growth inhibition was due primarily to the S phase arrest and cell apoptosis. Cell apoptosis induced by TSN was confirmed by Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining. The increase of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, cleaved PARP and caspase-3, and the decrease of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were observed. Western blot analysis indicated that TSN inhibits the CDC42/MEKK1/JNK pathway. Taken together, our study suggested, for the first time, that the pro-apoptotic effects of TSN on HL-60 cells were mediated through JNK signaling pathway.

23402270|t|Binding between proteins and cationic spherical polyelectrolyte brushes: effect of pH, ionic strength, and stoichiometry.
23402270|a|Cationic spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPBs) were synthesized by photoemulsion polymerization, consisting of a polystyrene core with a diameter around 80 nm and a poly(2-aminoethylmethacrylate hydrochloride) (PAEMH) shell with a thickness from 10 to 50 nm densely grafted on the core surface. The binding of various proteins onto SPBs was observed by turbidimetric titration, dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The binding, aggregation, and releasing of proteins by SPB can be tuned by modulating pH. The pH regions of binding for bovine serum albumin (BSA), b-lactoglobulin (BLG), and papain onto SPBs are markedly different and tunable by ionic strength and stoichiometry between protein and SPB. Binding energetics, affinity, and amount of various proteins onto cationic SPBs were determined by ITC. These findings lay the foundation for SPB applications in the protein purification and selective immobilization of different proteins, enzymes, and antibodies.

18973551|t|Dopamine D3 receptor-preferring agonists increase dendrite arborization of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons via extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation.
18973551|a|Clinical improvements in Parkinson's disease produced by dopamine D3 receptor-preferring agonists have been related to their neuroprotective actions and, more recently, to their neuroregenerative properties. However, it is unclear whether dopamine agonists produce their neurotrophic effects by acting directly on receptors expressed by the mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons or indirectly on receptors expressed by astrocytes, via release of neurotrophic factors. In this study, we investigated the effects of the dopamine D3 receptor-preferring agonists quinpirole and 7-hydroxy-N,N-di-propyl-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT), as well as of the indirect agonist amphetamine, on dopaminergic neurons identified by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-IR). Experiments were performed on neuronal-enriched primary cultures containing less than 0.5% of astrocytes prepared from the mouse embryo mesencephalon. After 3 days of incubation, both quinpirole (1-10 microm) and 7-OH-DPAT (5-500 nm) dose-dependently increased the maximal dendrite length (P < 0.001), number of primary dendrites (P < 0.01) and [3H]dopamine uptake (P < 0.01) of TH-IR-positive mesencephalic neurons. Similar effects were observed with 10 microm amphetamine. All neurotrophic effects were blocked by the unselective D2/D3 receptor antagonist sulpiride (5 microm) and by the selective D3 receptor antagonist SB-277011-A at a low dose (50 nm). Quinpirole and 7-OH-DPAT also increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) within minutes, an effect blocked by pretreatment with SB-277011-A. Inhibition of the D2/D3 receptor signalling pathway to ERK was obtained with PD98059, GF109203 or LY294002, resulting in blockade of neurotrophic effects. These data suggest that dopamine agonists increase dendritic arborizations of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons via a direct effect on D2/D3 receptors, preferentially involving D3 receptor-dependent neurotransmission.

17549299|t|Parnaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, prevents P-selectin-dependent formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates in human whole blood.
17549299|a|Parnaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), prevents platelet activation and interaction with polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) in a washed cell system. The in-vitro effect of parnaparin was studied here on platelet-PMN aggregates formed with more physiologic approaches in whole blood, in parallel with unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin, another LMWH. Citrated blood from healthy subjects was stimulated: i) from passage through the "Platelet Function Analyzer" (PFA-100), a device that exposes blood to standardized high shear flow through collagen/ADP cartridges; ii) by collagen and ADP (2 and 50 mug/ml, respectively) added in combination under stirring in an aggregometer cuvette; iii) with recombinant Tissue Factor, to generate thrombin concentrations able to activate platelets without inducing blood clotting, or iv) the Thrombin Receptor Activating Peptide-6 (TRAP-6). Platelet P-selectin and platelet-PMN aggregates were measured by flow cytometry upon stimulation of blood. Fibrinogen binding to platelets and markers of PMN activation were also detected. Platelet P-selectin expression and platelet-PMN aggregate formation were induced in all four activation conditions tested. Parnaparin prevented in a concentration-dependent manner (0.3-0.8 IUaXa/ml) the expression of P-selectin and the formation of mixed aggregates, while the two reference heparin preparations had a much weaker effect. Platelet fibrinogen binding and PMN activation markers (fibrinogen binding, CD11b and CD40) were also prevented by parnaparin. These data extend in more physiological systems of platelet activation, the anti-inflammatory profile of parnaparin, previously reported in washed cells. The greater effect of parnaparin, as compared to the reference heparins, could be due to chemico-physical differences possibly unrelated to their anticoagulant effect.

16247743|t|Guidance on the use of miglustat for treating patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.
16247743|a|Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) is a progressive lysosomal storage disorder due to an autosomal recessive deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. Clinical manifestations include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone and pulmonary disease. Intravenous enzyme replacement (ERT) with imiglucerase is the accepted standard for treatment of symptomatic patients. More than 3,500 patients worldwide have received ERT with well-documented beneficial effects on the hematological, visceral, skeletal, and pulmonary manifestations, and with resultant improvement in health-related quality of life. Miglustat, an imino sugar that reversibly inhibits glucosylceramide synthase and reduces intracellular substrate burden, is an oral treatment for patients with type 1 GD that was recently approved in the United States for symptomatic patients with mild to moderate clinical manifestations for whom ERT is not an option. Because responses to miglustat are slower and less robust than those observed with ERT, and because miglustat is associated with significant side effects, clinicians who care for patients with GD should become familiar with the limited indications for miglustat use and the circumstances when it may be prescribed appropriately. This review article and position statement represents the current opinion of American physicians with extensive expertise in GD regarding patient management in the context of the availability of standard imiglucerase treatment and the recent introduction of miglustat.

9310349|t|Alendronate inhibition of protein-tyrosine-phosphatase-meg1.
9310349|a|Alendronate (4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate) is a potent bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption and has proven effective for the treatment of osteoporosis. Its molecular mechanism of action, however, has not been defined precisely. Here we report that alendronate is a potent inhibitor of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase-meg1 (PTPmeg1). Two substrates were employed in this study: fluorescein diphosphate and the phosphotyrosyl peptide src-pY527. With either substrate, alendronate was a slow binding inhibitor of PTPmeg1. Among the other bisphosphonates studied, alendronate was more potent and selective for PTPmeg1. The hydrolysis of fluorescein diphosphate by PTP epsilon and PTPmeg1 was sensitive to alendronate, with IC50 values of less than 1 microM; PTPsigma, however, under the same conditions, was inhibited by only 50% with 141 microM alendronate. Similarly, with the src-pY527 substrate, alendronate inhibition was also PTP dependent. Alendronate inhibited PTPmeg1 with an IC50 value of 23 microM, PTPsigma with an IC50 value of 2 microM, and did not inhibit PTP epsilon at concentrations up to 1 mM. The alendronate inhibition of these three PTPs and two substrates is consistent with the formation of a ternary complex comprised of enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor. PTP inhibition by hisphosphonates or vanadate was diminished by the metal chelating agent EDTA, or by the reducing agent dithiothreitol, suggesting that a metal ion and the oxidation of a cysteine residue are required for full inhibition. These observations show substrate- and enzyme-specific PTP inhibition by alendronate and support the possibility that a certain PTP(s) may be the molecular target for alendronate action.

12837768|t|chi-Conopeptide MrIA partially overlaps desipramine and cocaine binding sites on the human norepinephrine transporter.
12837768|a|The interactions of chi-conopeptide MrIA with the human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) were investigated by determining the effects of hNET point mutations on the inhibitory potency of MrIA. The mutants were produced by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in COS-7 cells. The potency of MrIA was greater for inhibition of uptake by hNET of [3H]norepinephrine (Ki 1.89 microM) than [3H]dopamine (Ki 4.33 microM), and the human dopamine transporter and serotonin transporter were not inhibited by MrIA (to 7 microM). Of 18 mutations where hNET amino acid residues were exchanged with those of the human dopamine transporter, MrIA had increased potency for inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake for three mutations (in predicted extracellular loops 3 and 4 and transmembrane domain (TMD) 8) and decreased potency for one mutation (in TMD6 and intracellular loop (IL) 3). Of the 12 additional mutations in TMDs 2, 4, 5, and 11 and IL1, three mutations (in TMD2 and IL1) had reduced MrIA inhibitory potency. All of the other mutations tested had no influence on MrIA potency. A comparison of the results with previous data for desipramine and cocaine inhibition of norepinephrine uptake by the mutant hNETs reveals that MrIA binding to hNET occurs at a site that is distinct from but overlaps with the binding sites for tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine.

2899826|t|Muscarinic cholinergic and histamine H1 receptor binding of phenothiazine drug metabolites.
2899826|a|In vitro binding affinities of chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, levomepromazine, perphenazine and some of their metabolites for dopamine D2 receptors, alpha 1- and alpha 2 adrenoceptors in rat brain were previously reported from our laboratories. The present study reports the in vitro binding affinities of the same compounds for muscarinic cholinergic receptors and for histamine H1 receptors in rat brain, using 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate and 3H-mepyramine as radioligands. Chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, and their metabolites had 5-30 times higher binding affinities for muscarinic cholinergic receptors than fluphenazine, perphenazine and their metabolites. Levomepromazine was the most potent and fluphenazine the least potent of the four drugs in histamine H1 receptor binding. 7-Hydroxy levomepromazine, 3-hydroxy levomepromazine and 7-hydroxy fluphenazine had only 10% of the potency of the parent drug in histamine H1 receptor binding, while the 7-hydroxy-metabolites of chlorpromazine and perphenazine had about 75% of the potency of the parent drug in this binding system. Their histamine H1 receptor binding affinities indicate that metabolites may contribute to the sedative effects of chlorpromazine and levomepromazine.

23373677|t|Investigation of astatine(III) hydrolyzed species: experiments and relativistic calculations.
23373677|a|This work aims to resolve some controversies about astatine(III) hydroxide species present in oxidant aqueous solution. AtO(+) is the dominant species existing under oxidizing and acidic pH conditions. This is consistent with high-performance ion-exchange chromatography data showing the existence of one species holding one positive charge. A change in speciation occurs as the pH changes from 1 to 4, while remaining under oxidizing conditions. Dynamic experiments with ion-exchange resins evidence the existence of a neutral species witnessed by its elution in the void volume. Batch-experiments using a competition method show the exchange of one proton indicating the formation of the AtO(OH) species. The hydrolysis thermodynamic constant, extrapolated to zero ionic strength, was determined to be 10(-1.9). This value is supported by two-component relativistic quantum calculations and therefore allows disclosing unambiguously the structure of the formed species.

15866288|t|Effects of inhibition of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) by amiloride in the cornea and tear fluid of eyes irradiated with UVB.
15866288|a|The purpose of the present study was to test our hypothesis that amiloride, a specific u-PA inhibitor, effectively decreases u-PA activity in cornea as well as in tear fluid and favourably affects corneal healing. Therefore, comparative histochemical and biochemical studies of u-PA and the effects of amiloride were performed on rabbit corneas and tear fluid using the sensitive fluorogenic substrate Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. Rabbit eyes were repeatedly irradiated with UVB for 9 days and during the irradiation topically treated with amiloride (1 mg/ml saline) or placebo (saline) (dropwise, 5 times daily). Results show that in placebo-treated eyes, UVB evoked the appearance of u-PA activity in cornea and tear fluid in early stages of irradiation, and u-PA levels increased during irradiation. Corneal epithelium was gradually lost and remnants of the epithelium as well as keratocytes in the upper part of corneal stroma showed high u-PA activity. Finally, corneas lost their epithelium completely. In corneal stroma, numerous u-PA-containing inflammatory cells were present. Corneas were vascularized. When amiloride was dropped on the eye surface on the first day of irradiation and subsequently daily until the end of the experiment, u-PA activity in both cornea and tear fluid was strongly inhibited. Corneas were covered with a continuous epithelium until the end of the experiment. The number of inflammatory cells was significantly decreased. Corneal vascularization was reduced by 50%. In conclusion, early application of amiloride inhibited u-PA activity in UVB-irradiated corneas as well as in tear fluid and diminished the development of corneal pathology.

17459764|t|n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids induce the expression of COX-2 via PPARgamma activation in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells.
17459764|a|Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) n-3 inhibit inflammation, in vivo and in vitro in keratinocytes. We examined in HaCaT keratinocyte cell line whether eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) a n-3 PUFA, gamma-linoleic acid (GLA) a n-6 PUFA, and arachidic acid a saturated fatty acid, modulate expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme pivotal to skin inflammation and reparation. We demonstrate that only treatment of HaCaT with GLA and EPA or a PPARgamma ligand (roziglitazone), induced COX-2 expression (protein and mRNA). Moreover stimulation of COX-2 promoter activity was increased by those PUFAs or rosiglitazone. The inhibitory effects of GW9662 and T0070907 (PPARgamma antagonists), on COX-2 expression and on stimulation of COX-2 promoter activity by EPA and GLA suggest that PPARgamma is implicated in COX-2 induction. Finally, PLA2 inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate blocked the PUFA effects on COX-2 induction, promoter activity and arachidonic acid mobilization suggesting involvement of AA metabolites in PPAR activation. These findings demonstrate that n-3 and n-6 PUFA increased PPARgamma activity is necessary for the COX-2 induction in HaCaT human keratinocyte cells. Given the anti-inflammatory properties of EPA, we suggest that induction of COX-2 in keratinocytes may be important in the anti-inflammatory and protective mechanism of action of PUFAs n-3 or n-6.

10424850|t|Desipramine treatment decreases 3H-nisoxetine binding and norepinephrine transporter mRNA in SK-N-SHSY5Y cells.
10424850|a|The antidepressant desipramine has been shown to decrease synaptic membrane concentrations of the norepinephrine re-uptake transporter (NET) in vivo and in vitro, on both an acute and a chronic basis. The possible contribution of decreased NET synthesis to the chronic downregulation of the NETs has not been definitively established. In this study, we treated SK-N-SHSY5Y cells with 100 nM desipramine for 24 or 72 h, and measured 3H-nisoxetine binding (as an estimate of NETs) and NET mRNA by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Similar to what has been reported previously, membrane 3H-nisoxetine binding was significantly decreased at both 24 and 72 h (approximately 50% at both time points). However, a significant decrease (64 +/- 8% of paired control) of NET mRNA was observed only at the 72-h time point. We conclude that decreased NET synthesis may contribute to the chronic, but not acute, effect of desipramine to downregulate the NET.

20104269|t|Bile acids induce cdx2 expression through the farnesoid x receptor in gastric epithelial cells.
20104269|a|Clinical and experimental studies showed that the reflux of bile into the stomach contributes to the induction of intestinal metaplasia of the stomach and gastric carcinogenesis. Caudal-type homeobox 2 (Cdx2) plays a key role in the exhibition of intestinal phenotypes by regulating the expression of intestine-specific genes such as goblet-specific gene mucin 2 (MUC2). We investigated the involvement of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor for bile acids, in the chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)-induced expression of Cdx2 and MUC2 in normal rat gastric epithelial cells (RGM-1 cells). RGM-1 cells were treated with CDCA or GW4064, an FXR agonist, in the presence or absence of guggulsterone, an FXR antagonist. CDCA induced dose-dependent expression of Cdx2 and MUC2 at both the mRNA and protein levels. The maximum stimulation of Cdx2 and MUC2 mRNA induced by CDCA was observed at 3 h and by 6 h, respectively. GW4064 also induced expression of these molecules. The effects of CDCA and GW4064 on expression of Cdx2 and MUC2 were abolished by guggulsterone. These findings suggest that bile acids may induce gastric intestinal metaplasia and carcinogenesis through the FXR.

7703721|t|Estramustine binding protein in primary tumours and metastases of malignant melanoma.
7703721|a|The presence of estramustine binding protein (EMBP), a 54 kD cytosolic glycoprotein, which is distinct from the estrogen receptor, was investigated in a pilot study of primary malignant melanomas and their metastases. In 11 primary melanomas EMBP was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The percentage of positive melanoma cells ranged between 11-91% with a mean of 57%. Radioimmunoassay on metastatic tissue revealed significant amounts of EMBP, with values ranging between 0.6-4.2 with a mean of 1.6 ng/mg protein. A high number of cells with a positive stain for EMBP in the primary tumours was significantly correlated to a short interval between diagnosis and the occurrence of metastases. Presence of EMBP in malignant melanoma may have prognostic significance and the role of hormone-linked cytostatic drugs in the treatment of this disease needs further investigation.

23324400|t|HOW GOOD IS THE LEVOTHYROXINE REPLACEMENT IN PRIMARY HYPOTHYROIDISM PATIENTS IN BRAZIL?- DATA OF A MULTICENTRE STUDY.
23324400|a|Background : Studies done in every continent has shown that only around 50% of the patients subjected to thyroid hormone replacement have TSH in the normal range. However, until to date, there are no consistent data about Brazil. Objectives: To evaluate levothyroxine (LT4) replacement treatment in patients with primary hypothyroidism followed in referral centers in Brazil. Methods: Patients with primary hypothyroidism followed in referral centers (University Hospitals from Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro -UFRJ, Unicamp, Universidade Federal do Parana - UFPR and Universidade Federal do Ceara-UFC) answered a questionnairethat inquired about clinical and biochemical conditions, social-economic status, life quality and clinicians' orientations as well as their understanding about the information given. Serum TSH was checked close to the interview. Results: 2292 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean age 51.2 years and TSH values between 0.4 and 4.0 mUI/l were considered to be within the reference range. Among all patients taking thyroid medication, 42.7%% had an abnormal serum TSH (28.3% were undertreated and 14.4% were over treated). Approximately all patients (99%) took LT4 in the morning but less than 30 minutes before breakfast (85.4%). Regarding the clinicians   orientations: 97.5% of the patients were instructed to take the medication daily, and 92.6% to take 30 minutes before breakfast (92.6%). However, only 52.1% were told that not to take LT4 along with other medication. Conclusions: Our study found that there was a significant number of patients taking thyroid hormones were not in the therapeutic range. Clinicians should, therefore, consider monitoring patients on thyroid replacement more frequently and being more precise on giving recommendations about the correct use of LT4.

23601753|t|Robust autoactivation, chymotrypsin C independence and diminished secretion define a subset of hereditary pancreatitis associated cationic trypsinogen mutants.
23601753|a|Mutations in human cationic trypsinogen cause hereditary pancreatitis by altering its proteolytic regulation of activation and degradation by chymotrypsin C (CTRC). CTRC stimulates trypsinogen autoactivation by processing the activation peptide to a shorter form but also promotes degradation by cleaving the calcium binding loop in trypsinogen. Mutations render trypsinogen resistant to CTRC-mediated degradation and/or increase processing of the activation peptide by CTRC. Here we demonstrate that activation peptide mutations D19A, D22G, K23R and K23_I24insIDK robustly increased the rate of trypsinogen autoactivation, both in the presence and absence of CTRC. Degradation of the mutants by CTRC was unchanged and processing of the activation peptide was increased only in the D19A mutant by 4-fold. Surprisingly, however, this increased processing had only a minimal effect on autoactivation. The tetra-aspartate motif in the trypsinogen activation peptide binds calcium (KD ~1.6 mM), which stimulates autoactivation. Unexpectedly, calcium binding was not compromised by any of the activation peptide mutations. Despite normal binding, autoactivation of mutants D22G and K23_I24insIDK was not stimulated by calcium. Finally, the activation peptide mutants exhibited reduced secretion from transfected cells, and secreted trypsinogen levels were inversely proportional with autoactivation rates. We conclude that D19A, D22G, K23R and K23_I24insIDK form a mechanistically distinct subset of hereditary pancreatitis associated mutations, which exert their effect primarily through direct stimulation of autoactivation, independently of CTRC. The potentially severe clinical impact of the markedly increased autoactivation is offset by diminished secretion, resulting in a clinical phenotype indistinguishable from typical hereditary pancreatitis.

23574017|t|Effects of 17a-ethynylestradiol-induced cholestasis on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin in rats: reduced biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism of doxorubicin.
23574017|a|Abstract 1. Since the prevalent hormonal combination therapy with estrogen analogues in cancer patients has frequency and possibility to induce the cholestasis, the frequent combination therapy with 17a-ethynylestradiol (EE, an oral contraceptive) and doxorubicin (an anticancer drug) might be monitored in aspect of efficacy and safety. Doxorubicin is mainly excreted into the bile via P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) in hepatobiliary route and metabolized via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A subfamily. Also the hepatic Mrp2 (not P-gp) and CYP3A subfamily levels were reduced in EE-induced cholestatic (EEC) rats. Thus, we herein report the pharmacokinetic changes of doxorubicin with respect to the changes in its biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism in EEC rats. 2. The pharmacokinetic study of doxorubicin after intravenous administration of its hydrochloride was conducted along with the investigation of bile flow rate and hepatobiliary excretion of doxorubicin in control and EEC rats. 3. The significantly greater AUC (58.7% increase) of doxorubicin in EEC rats was due to the slower CL (32.9% decrease). The slower CL was due to the reduction of hepatic biliary excretion (67.0% decrease) and hepatic CYP3A subfamily-mediated metabolism (21.9% decrease) of doxorubicin. These results might have broader implications to understand the altered pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacologic effects of doxorubicin via biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism in experimental and clinical estrogen-induced cholestasis.

23287538|t|Alcohol intoxications during adolescence increase motivation for alcohol in adult rats and induce neuroadaptations in the nucleus accumbens.
23287538|a|Adolescent alcohol binge drinking constitutes a major vulnerability factor to develop alcoholism. However, mechanisms underlying this susceptibility remain unknown. We evaluated the effect of adolescent binge-like ethanol intoxication on vulnerability to alcohol abuse in Sprague-Dawley rats. To model binge-like ethanol intoxication, every 2 days, rats received an ethanol injection (3.0 g/kg) for 2 consecutive days across 14 days either from postnatal day 30 (PND30) to 43 (early adolescence) or from PND 45 to PND 58 (late adolescence). In young adult animals, we measured free ethanol consumption in the two-bottle choice paradigm, motivation for ethanol in the operant self-administration task and both ethanol's rewarding and aversive properties in the conditioned place preference (CPP) and taste aversion (CTA) paradigms. While intermittent ethanol intoxications (IEI) during late adolescence had no effect on free-choice 10% ethanol consumption, we found that IEI during early adolescence promoted free-choice 10% ethanol consumption, enhanced motivation for ethanol in the self-administration paradigm and induced a loss of both ethanol-induced CPP and CTA in young adults. No modification in either sucrose self-administration or amphetamine-induced CPP was observed. As the nucleus accumbens (Nac) is particularly involved in addictive behavior, we analyzed IEI-induced long-term neuroadaptations in the Nac using c-Fos immunohistochemistry and an array of neurotransmission-related genes. This vulnerability to ethanol abuse was associated with a lower c-Fos immunoreactivity in the Nac and enduring alterations of the expression of Penk and Slc6a4, 2 neurotransmission-related genes that have been shown to play critical roles in the behavioral effects of ethanol and alcoholism.

16835395|t|Gene deletion reveals roles for annexin A1 in the regulation of lipolysis and IL-6 release in epididymal adipose tissue.
16835395|a|In this study, epididymal adipose tissue from male annexin 1 (ANXA1)-null and wild-type control mice were used to explore the potential role of ANXA1 in adipocyte biology. ANXA1 was detected by Western blot analysis in wild-type tissue and localized predominantly to the stromal-vascular compartment. Epididymal fat pad mass was reduced by ANXA1 gene deletion, but adipocyte size was unchanged, suggesting that ANXA1 is required for the maintenance of adipocyte and/or preadipocyte cell number. Epididymal tissue from wild-type mice responded in vitro to noradrenaline and isoprenaline with increased glycerol release, reduced IL-6 release, and increased cAMP accumulation. Qualitatively similar but significantly attenuated responses to the catecholamines were observed in tissue from ANXA1-null mice, an effect that was not associated with changes in beta-adrenoceptor mRNA expression. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also stimulated lipolysis in vitro, but its effects were muted by ANXA1 gene deletion. By contrast, LPS failed to influence IL-6 release from wild-type tissue but stimulated the release of the cytokine from tissue from ANXA1-null mice. ANXA1 gene deletion did not affect glucocorticoid receptor expression or the ability of dexamethasone to suppress catecholamine-induced lipolysis. It did, however, augment IL-6 expression and modify the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on IL-6 release. Collectively, these studies suggest that ANXA1 supports aspects of adipose tissue mass and alters the sensitivity of epididymal adipose tissue to catecholamines, glucocorticoids, and LPS, thereby modulating lipolysis and IL-6 release.

23290724|t|Zinc drives a tertiary fold in the prion protein with familial disease mutation sites at the interface.
23290724|a|The cellular prion protein PrP(C) consists of two domains--a flexible N-terminal domain, which participates in copper and zinc regulation, and a largely helical C-terminal domain that converts to b sheet in the course of prion disease. These two domains are thought to be fully independent and noninteracting. Compelling cellular and biophysical studies, however, suggest a higher order structure that is relevant to both PrP(C) function and misfolding in disease. Here, we identify a Zn2+-driven N-terminal to C-terminal tertiary interaction in PrP(C). The C-terminal surface participating in this interaction carries the majority of the point mutations that confer familial prion disease. Investigation of mutant PrPs finds a systematic relationship between the type of mutation and the apparent strength of this domain structure. The structural features identified here suggest mechanisms by which physiologic metal ions trigger PrP(C) trafficking and control prion disease.

16206183|t|In vivo comparison of the reinforcing and dopamine transporter effects of local anesthetics in rhesus monkeys.
16206183|a|Dopaminergic mechanisms are thought to play a central role in the reinforcing effects of cocaine. Similar to cocaine, other local anesthetics bind to the dopamine transporter (DAT) and inhibit DA uptake in rodent and monkey brain. Additionally, local anesthetics are self-administered in rhesus monkeys, indicative of abuse liability. The present study examined the reinforcing and DAT effects of the local anesthetics dimethocaine, procaine and cocaine using in vivo techniques. Monkeys were trained to respond under a second-order schedule for i.v. cocaine administration (0.10 or 0.30 mg/kg/infusion). When responding was stable, dimethocaine (0.030-1.7 mg/kg/ infusion) or procaine (0.10-10 mg/kg/ infusion) was substituted for the cocaine training dose. Dimethocaine administration produced higher response rates compared with that of procaine, and was a more potent reinforcer. Drug effects on behavior were related to DAT occupancy in monkey striatum during neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET). DAT occupancy was determined by displacement of 8-(2-[(18)F]fluroethyl)2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)nortropane (FECNT). DAT occupancy was between 66 and 82% and <10-41% for doses of dimethocaine and procaine that maintained maximum response rates, respectively. Finally, in vivo microdialysis in awake subjects determined drug-induced changes in extracellular DA in the caudate nucleus. There was close correspondence between peak increases in DA and DAT occupancy. Overall, reinforcing effects were consistent with DAT effects determined with in vivo techniques. The results further support a role for the DAT in the abuse liability of local anesthetics.

22820907|t|Current understanding of TRPM7 pharmacology and drug development for stroke.
22820907|a|The initial excitement and countless efforts to find a pharmacological agent that disrupts the excitotoxic pathway of ischemic neuronal death have only led to disappointing clinical trials. Currently, a thrombolytic agent called recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only pharmacological treatment available for patients with acute ischemic stroke in most countries. Even though its efficacy has been confirmed repeatedly, rt-PA is considerably underused due to reasons including a short therapeutic window and repeated complications associated with its use. A search for alternative mechanisms that may operate dependently or independently with the well-established excitotoxic mechanism has led researchers to the discovery of newly described non-glutamate mechanisms. Among the latter, transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is one of the important nonglutamate mechanisms in stroke, which has been evaluated in both in-vitro and in-vivo. In this review, we will discuss the current state of pharmacological treatments of ischemic stroke and provide evidence that TRPM7 is a promising therapeutic target of stroke.

23348754|t|A brief history of oxytocin and its role in modulating psychostimulant effects.
23348754|a|Over the past century, the polypeptide oxytocin has played an important role in medicine with major highlights including the identification of its involvement in parturition and the milk let-down reflex. Oxytocin is now implicated in an extensive range of psychological phenomena including reward and memory processes and has been investigated as a treatment for several psychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, autism, and schizophrenia. In this review, we first provide an historical overview of oxytocin and describe key aspects of its physiological activity. We then outline some pharmacological limitations in this field of research before highlighting the role of oxytocin in a wide range of behavioral and neuronal processes. Finally, we review evidence for a modulatory role of oxytocin with regard to psychostimulant effects. Key findings suggest that oxytocin attenuates a broad number of cocaine and methamphetamine induced behaviors and associated neuronal activity in rodents. Evidence also outlines a role for oxytocin in the prosocial effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) in both rodents and humans. Clinical trials should now investigate the effectiveness of oxytocin as a novel intervention for psychostimulant addiction and should aim to determine its specific role in the therapeutic properties of MDMA that are currently being investigated.

23030680|t|In vitro metabolism of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptor antagonist elzasonan.
23030680|a|The metabolism of elzasonan has been examined in vitro using hepatic microsomes from human and recombinant heterologously expressed P450 enzymes (rCYP). Metabolism occurs primarily via oxidative N-demethylation to form M4 and oxidation reactions to form elzasonan N-oxide (M5) and 5-hydroxyelzasonan metabolite (M3). Additionally, elzasonan was shown to be metabolized to the novel cyclized indole metabolite (M6) which undergoes subsequent oxidation to form the iminium ion metabolite (M3a). The rCYP data was normalized relative to the levels of each CYP form in native human liver microsomes to better assess the contribution of each rCYP in the metabolism of elzasonan. Results demonstrated the involvement of CYP3A4 in the pathways leading to M3a, M3, M5 and M6 and CYP2C8 in the formation of M4. Kinetic constants for the formation of M3 were determined and correlation and inhibition studies suggested that CYP3A4 is primarily responsible for the formation of M3 and CYP2C19 plays a very minor role in its formation. Cytochrome b5 has shown to be an essential component in P450 3A4 catalyzed 5-hydroxyelzasonan formation and provides insights on the disconnect between human liver microsomes data and that of rCYP. Furthermore, rCYP3A4 containing b5 are useful models for predicting the rates for liver microsomes P450-dependent drug oxidations and should be utilized routinely.

19370562|t|Rivastigmine for Alzheimer's disease.
19370562|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in relevant parts of the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and low risk of adverse effects, have now been introduced. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 27 March 2008 using the terms: Rivastigmine OR exelon OR ENA OR "SDZ ENA 713" . The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for more than two weeks and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One reviewer (JSB) applied study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials, involving 4775 participants, were included in the analyses. Use of rivastigmine in high doses was associated with statistically significant benefits on several measures. High-dose rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily) was associated with a two-point improvement in cognitive function on the ADAS-Cog score compared with placebo (weighted mean difference -1.99, 95% confidence interval -2.49 to -1.50, on an intention-to-treat basis) and a 2.2 point improvement in activities of daily living assessed on the Progressive Deterioration Scale (weighted mean difference -2.15, 95% confidence interval -3.16 to -1.13, on an intention-to-treat basis) at 26 weeks. At lower doses (4 mg daily or lower) differences were in the same direction but were statistically significant only for cognitive function. There were statistically significantly higher numbers of events of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, headache, syncope, abdominal pain and dizziness among patients taking high-dose rivastigmine than among those taking placebo. There was some evidence that adverse events might be less common with more frequent, smaller doses of rivastigmine. The 2008 update includes a new study testing two types of rivastigmine transdermal patch, one delivering a higher dose than previously tested (17.4 mg/day) and a smaller patch delivering 9.6 mg/day. The efficacy of the smaller patch was not significantly different compared with the capsules of similar daily dose, but was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, dizziness and asthenia. The efficacy of the larger patch was not significantly different compared with the smaller patch, but the smaller patch was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dizziness. There appears to be advantages associated with the smaller patch compared with both the higher dose patch and the 6-12 mg/day capsules. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Rivastigmine appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of decline of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and severity of dementia with daily doses of 6 to 12 mg. Adverse events were consistent with the cholinergic actions of the drug. A transdermal patch has been tested in one trial, and there is evidence that the lower dose smaller patch is associated with fewer side effects than the capsules or the higher dose larger patch and has comparable efficacy to both. This review has not examined economic data.

9476974|t|Monoamine transporter and sodium channel mechanisms in the rapid pressor response to cocaine.
9476974|a|Intravenous (I.V.) cocaine (0.03-3 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent, rapid, and brief increases in blood pressure (BP) in conscious rats pretreated with the dopamine receptor antagonist, SCH 23390. Monoamine uptake inhibitors structurally analogous to cocaine (cocaethylene, CFT, betaCIT, CPT, (+)-cocaine, norcocaine, and benztropine) also produced this rapid pressor response, whereas structurally unrelated uptake inhibitors with diverse monoamine transporter selectivities (BTCP, indatraline, GBR 12935, mazindol, nomifensine, and zimeldine) either did not produce a rapid pressor response or produced only a small pressor response. At nonconvulsant doses, the sodium channel blockers acetylprocainamide, dibucaine, dyclonine, prilocaine, proparacaine, quinidine, and tetracaine produced a small pressor response or no increase in BP. In rats implanted with telemetric devices, cocaine and its analog, CFT, produced a biphasic pharmacological response that consisted of an initial brief and abrupt behavioral arousal associated with a rapid, large increase in BP followed by prolonged, parallel increases in BP and locomotor activity. Pretreatment with SCH 23390 prevented the prolonged but not the initial rapid and brief pressor and activity responses to both cocaine and CFT administration. The present data suggest that the inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin transporter functions, either alone or in combination, does not mediate the rapid pressor response to cocaine. The sodium channel-blocking action of cocaine per se does not appear to be involved in the rapid pressor response to cocaine. Finally, the present results confirm previous findings that dopaminergic mechanisms mediate the prolonged increases in BP and locomotor activity produced by cocaine.

23385325|t|QM/MM simulations of vibrational spectra of bacteriorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin-2.
23385325|a|Channelrhodopsin-2 is a light-gated ion channel, which has been studied intensively over the last decade. Vibrational spectroscopic experiments started to shed light on the structural changes, that occur during the photocycle, especially in the hydrogen-bonded network surrounding the protonated D156 and C128 - the DC gate. However, the interpretation of these experiments was only based on homology models. Since then, an X-ray structure and better computational models became available. In this article, we show that in combination with a recent reparametrization, the approximate DFT method, DFTB, is able to describe the effects of hydrogen bonding on the C[double bond, length as m-dash]O stretch vibration in carboxylic acids reliably and agrees well with full DFT results. We apply DFTB in a QM/MM framework to perform vibrational analysis of buried aspartic acids in bacteriorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin-2. Using this approach, we can simulate the FTIR spectral difference between D115 in the dark-adapted and K states of bacteriorhodopsin. The FTIR experiments on the DC gate in channelrhodopsin-2 are well described using an indirect model, where D156 and C128 are bridged via a water molecule.

17510308|t|Estimation of warfarin maintenance dose based on VKORC1 (-1639 G>A) and CYP2C9 genotypes.
17510308|a|BACKGROUND: CYP2C9 polymorphisms are associated with decreased S-warfarin clearance and lower maintenance dosage. Decreased expression of VKORC1 resulting from the -1639G>A substitution has also been implicated in lower warfarin dose requirements. We investigated the additional contribution of this polymorphism to the variance in warfarin dose. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with stable anticoagulation were genotyped for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 with Tag-It allele-specific primer extension technology. Plasma S-warfarin concentrations and warfarin maintenance dose were compared among patients on the basis of the VKORC1 -1639G>A genotype. RESULTS: Eighty percent of CYP2C9*1/*1 patients stabilized on <4.0 mg/day warfarin had at least 1 VKORC1 -1639A allele. Mean warfarin doses (SD) were 6.7 (3.3), 4.3 (2.2), and 2.7 (1.2) mg/day for patients with the VKORC1 -1639GG, GA, and AA genotypes, respectively. Steady-state plasma concentrations of S-warfarin were lowest in patients with the VKORC1 -1639AA genotype and demonstrated a positive association with the VKORC1 -1639G allele copy number (trend P = 0.012). A model including VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes, age, sex, and body weight accounted for 61% of the variance in warfarin daily maintenance dose. CONCLUSIONS: The VKORC1 -1639A allele accounts for low dosage requirements of most patients without a CYP2C9 variant. Higher plasma S-warfarin concentrations corresponding to increased warfarin maintenance dosages support a hypothesis for increased expression of the VKORC1 -1639G allele. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes, age, sex, and body weight account for the majority of variance in warfarin dose among our study population.

10225363|t|Both 5-HT1B and 5-HT1F receptors modulate c-fos expression within rat trigeminal nucleus caudalis.
10225363|a|A possible mechanism of action of antimigraine drugs such as sumatriptan is inhibition of the trigeminovascular pathway. Sumatriptan's effects might be mediated by 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D or 5-HT1F receptors. To establish the relative importance of these subtypes, we compared the effects of sumatriptan with those of a selective 5-HT1F receptor agonist (LY 344864) on c-fos protein expression in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. c-fos expression was induced in urethane-anaesthetized rats by intracisternal capsaicin administration. Sumatriptan and LY 344864 decreased the number of capsaicin-induced c-fos-like immunoreactive cells within trigeminal nucleus caudalis (ID50 = 0.04 and 0.6 mg kg(-1)). The effect of sumatriptan, but not of LY 344864, was prevented by pretreatment with the antagonist SDZ 21-009, which displays high affinity for rat 5-HT1B receptors. LY 344864 appears to attenuate c-fos-like immunoreactivity via 5-HT1F receptors, while sumatriptan acts via 5-HT1B receptors. The fact that activation of 5-HT1F receptors is sufficient to modulate the activity of the trigeminal system suggests that this receptor may be a target for antimigraine drugs with improved safety profile.

11732752|t|Comparison of vaginal aminopeptidase enzymatic activities in various animals and in humans.
11732752|a|The specific enzymatic activity of four different aminopeptidases (aminopeptidase N, leucine aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase A and aminopeptidase B) in vaginal homogenates from rabbit, rat, guinea-pig, sheep and humans was compared. The purpose of the study was to find an appropriate animal model that can be used in degradation studies of protein and peptide drugs. Different substrates were used as the relative specific substrates for the determination of aminopeptidase enzymatic activity: 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide of L-alanine for aminopeptidase N, 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide of L-leucine for leucine aminopeptidase, 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide of L-glutamic acid for aminopeptidase A and 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide of L-arginine for aminopeptidase B. The vaginal aminopeptidase enzymatic activity of different species was determined spectrofluorometrically. The inhibition of aminopeptidase activity in the presence of bestatin and puromycin inhibitors was also investigated. The results showed the presence of aminopeptidase enzymatic activity in all vaginal homogenates in the order: sheep > guinea-pig > rabbit > or = human > or = rat. Based on the results of the hydrolysis and inhibition of the 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide substrates, it was difficult to have an exact decision on the aminopeptidase type in the vaginal homogenates from the species studied. It was found that the aminopeptidase activity in rat, rabbit and humans was not statistically different. Therefore, we suggest that rats and rabbits could be used as model animals for vaginal enzymatic activity studies and for determination of the degradation of protein and peptide drugs in the vagina.

23594301|t|Development and validation of NIR-chemometric methods for chemical and pharmaceutical characterization of meloxicam tablets.
23594301|a|Abstract Context: Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is an important component of a Process Analytical Technology (PAT) toolbox and is a key technology for enabling the rapid analysis of pharmaceutical tablets. Objective: The aim of this research work was to develop and validate NIR-chemometric methods not only for the determination of active pharmaceutical ingredients content but also pharmaceutical properties (crushing strength, disintegration time) of meloxicam tablets. Materials and methods: The development of the method for active content assay was performed on samples corresponding to 80%, 90%, 100%, 110% and 120% of meloxicam content and the development of the methods for pharmaceutical characterization was performed on samples prepared at seven different compression forces (ranging from 7 to 45 kN) using NIR transmission spectra of intact tablets and PLS as a regression method. Results: The results show that the developed methods have good trueness, precision and accuracy and are appropriate for direct active content assay in tablets (ranging from 12 to 18 mg/tablet) and also for predicting crushing strength and disintegration time of intact meloxicam tablets. Discussion: The comparative data show that the proposed methods are in good agreement with the reference methods currently used for the characterization of meloxicam tablets (HPLC-UV methods for the assay and European Pharmacopeia methods for determining the crushing strength and disintegration time). Conclusion: The results show the possibility to predict both chemical properties (active content) and physical/pharmaceutical properties (crushing strength and disintegration time) directly, without any sample preparation, from the same NIR transmission spectrum of meloxicam tablets.

20596674|t|Moxifloxacin enhances etoposide-induced cytotoxic, apoptotic and anti-topoisomerase II effects in a human colon carcinoma cell line.
20596674|a|Etoposide (VP-16) is a topoisomerase-II (topo II) inhibitor chemotherapeutic agent. Studies have shown that a combination of VP-16 with other drugs demonstrates better clinical responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moxifloxacin (MXF) and VP-16 on cellular topo II activity in drug-treated cells and evaluate the influence of MXF on the mode of action of VP-16, on proliferation and apoptosis of HT-29 cells. Decatenation assay, band depletion and Western blot analysis, cytotoxic assay (MTT), flow cytometric studies (cell cycle and survivin expression), apoptosis (DAPI-sulforhodamine staining and caspase 3 activity) and IL-8 and VEGF secretion were determined. MXF or VP-16 slightly affected cellular topo II activity in nuclear extracts derived from drug-treated cells while the combination enhanced inhibitory activity and the reduction in band depletion of topo II. VP-16 induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M and the appearance of the subG1 peak which was increased by the addition of MXF. Apoptosis studies (DAPI staining and caspase 3 activity) showed a marked increase in the presence of MXF and VP-16 compared to VP-16 alone. VP-16 induced the release of IL-8, and addition of MXF reduced enhanced release and the spontaneous release of VEGF from the cells. In conclusion, the results suggest that the enhancement in the reduction of topo II activity by the combined MXF/VP-16 treatments was probably due to the increase in the level of the DNA-enzyme cleavable complexes formed by both drugs. The unique combination of MXF/VP-16 may have clinical benefits and a cytotoxic drug 'sparing effect' and should be further studied in vivo.

10988273|t|Species-specific pharmacological properties of human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors.
10988273|a|On the basis of data obtained in rabbits, the imidazoline receptor ligand rilmenidine has been suggested to decrease blood pressure in humans by activating central alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors. A prerequisite for this hypothesis was the unproved assumption that rabbit and human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors are equally activated by rilmenidine. Because alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors in the brain and on cardiovascular sympathetic nerve terminals are identical, the latter were used as a model for the former to confirm or disprove this assumption. Human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary arteries were used to determine the potencies of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists in inhibiting the electrically (2 Hz) evoked [(3)H]norepinephrine release and of antagonists in counteracting the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition induced by moxonidine. In the rabbit pulmonary artery, rilmenidine and oxymetazoline are potent full agonists, whereas in the human atrial appendages they are antagonists at the alpha(2)-autoreceptors, sharing this property with rauwolscine, phentolamine, and idazoxan. In contrast, prazosin is ineffective. In addition, a partial nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the rabbit alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor (a region known to substantially influence the pharmacological characteristics of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor) revealed marked differences between the rabbit and the human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor. The sympathetic nerves of both the human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary artery are endowed with alpha(2A)-autoreceptors, at which, however, both rilmenidine and oxymetazoline exhibit different properties (antagonism and agonism, respectively). The antagonistic property of rilmenidine at human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors indicates that in contrast to the suggestion based on rabbit data, the hypotensive property of the drug in humans is not due to activation of alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors but other, presumably I(1)-imidazoline receptors, are probably involved.

11161433|t|Breakdown of Th cell immune responses and steroidogenic CYP11A1 expression in CD4+ T cells in a murine model implanted with B16 melanoma.
11161433|a|The association between the balance of Th1/Th2 cell responses and CYP11A1 expression in CD4+ T cells was investigated in a murine model implanted with highly metastatic B16F10 melanoma cells (B16F10 mice). When 2 x 10(5) cells/mouse of B16F10 cells were inoculated into C57BL/6 mice, Th2 cell responses and pulmonary metastasis were increased. In addition, corticosterone levels in splenic tissue or serum and CYP11A1 mRNA expression (mRNA encoding cholesterol side-chain cleavage p450 enzyme) in CD4+ T cells were increased in these mice. When the anti-corticosterone drug aminoglutethimide (CYP11A1 inhibitor) was administered to B16F10 mice, corticosterone levels in splenic tissue or serum and CYP11A1 mRNA expression were decreased at 14 days after tumor inoculation. In addition, Th1 cell responses were restored and pulmonary metastasis was reduced by aminoglutethimide. These results indicated that the breakdown of Th cell responses and increase of pulmonary metastasis were due to an increase in steroidogenic CYP11A1 mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells. Moreover, it was suggested that promotion of CYP11A1 mRNA expression in Th2 cells was partially involved due to an increase in level of corticosterone in splenic tissue and the breakdown of Th cell responses locally in the splenic tissue, which then affected the maintenance of Th2 cell functions in the microenvironment of tumor-bearing mice.

11344206|t|Evidence for genetic heterogeneity of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1: identification of a novel mutation in the human mineralocorticoid receptor in one sporadic case and no mutations in two autosomal dominant kindreds.
11344206|a|Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by neonatal salt wasting resistant to mineralocorticoids. There are 2 forms of PHA1: the autosomal recessive form with symptoms persisting into adulthood, caused by mutations in the amiloride-sensitive luminal sodium channel, and the autosomal dominant or sporadic form, which shows milder symptoms that remit with age. Mutations in the gene encoding the human mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR) are, at least in some patients, responsible for the latter form of PHA1. We here report the results of a genetic study in a sporadic case and in 5 affected patients from 2 families with autosomal dominant PHA1. In the sporadic case we identified a new frameshift mutation, Ins2871C, in exon 9 of the hMR gene. Family members were asymptomatic and had no mutation. This mutation is the first described in exon 9 and impairs the last 27 amino acids of the hormone-binding domain. In 2 kindreds with autosomal dominant PHA1 we found no mutation of the hMR gene. Our results confirm the hypothesis that autosomal dominant or sporadic PHA1 is a genetically heterogeneous disease involving other, as yet unidentified, genes.

10493852|t|Structural basis for LFA-1 inhibition upon lovastatin binding to the CD11a I-domain.
10493852|a|The lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) belongs to the family of beta2-integrins and plays an important role in T-cell activation and leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. We report here that lovastatin, a drug clinically used for lowering cholesterol levels, inhibits the interaction of human LFA-1 with its counter-receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography we show that the inhibitor binds to a highly conserved domain of the LFA-1 alpha-chain called the I-domain. The first three-dimensional structure of an integrin inhibitor bound to its receptor reveals atomic details for a hitherto unknown mode of LFA-1 inhibition. It also sheds light into possible mechanisms of LFA-1 mediated signalling and will support the design of novel anti-adhesive and immunosuppressive drugs.

17379925|t|Quantification and regulation of the subcellular distribution of bile acid coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase activity in rat liver.
17379925|a|Bile acid coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) is responsible for the amidation of bile acids with the amino acids glycine and taurine. To quantify total BAT activity in liver subcellular organelles, livers from young adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were fractionated into multiple subcellular compartments. In male and female rats, 65-75% of total liver BAT activity was found in the cytosol, 15-17% was found in the peroxisomes, and 5-10% was found in the heavy mitochondrial fraction. After clofibrate treatment, male rats displayed an increase in peroxisomal BAT specific activity and a decrease in cytosolic BAT specific activity, whereas females showed an opposite response. However, there was no overall change in BAT specific activity in whole liver homogenate. Treatment with rosiglitazone or cholestyramine had no effect on BAT activity in any subcellular compartment. These experiments indicate that the majority of BAT activity in the rat liver resides in the cytosol. Approximately 15% of BAT activity is present in the peroxisomal matrix. These data support the novel finding that clofibrate treatment does not directly regulate BAT activity but does alter the subcellular localization of BAT.

12956944|a|AIM: To study the changes in the expression and phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the rat nucleus accumbens after chronic ethanol intake and its withdrawal. METHODS: Ethanol was given in drinking water at the concentration of 6 % (v/v), for one month. Changes in the levels of CREB and phospho-CREB (p-CREB) protein in the nucleus accumbens were measured by immunohistochemistry methods. RESULTS: Ethanol given to rats in drinking water decreased the level of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens (-75 %) at the time of exposure to ethanol. The decrement of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens remained at 24 h (-35 %) and 72 h (-28 %) of ethanol withdrawal, which recovered toward control level after 7 d of ethanol withdrawal. However, chronic ethanol, as well as ethanol withdrawal failed to produce any significant alteration in the level of CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens. Naloxone (alone) treatment of rats had no effect on the levels of CREB and p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens. However, when naloxone was administered concurrently with ethanol treatment, it antagonized the down-regulation of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens (142 %) of rats exposed to ethanol. CONCLUSION: A long-term intake of ethanol solution down-regulates the phosphorylation of CREB in the nucleus accumbens, and those changes can be reversed by naloxone, which may be one kind of the molecular mechanisms associated with ethanol dependence.

23583257|t|Quinone compounds regulate the level of ROS production by the NADPH oxidase Nox4.
23583257|a|NADPH oxidase Nox4 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and plays a role in cellular signaling by providing reactive oxygen species (ROS) as intracellular messengers. Nox4 oxidase activity is thought to be constitutive and regulated at the transcriptional level; however, we challenge this point of view and suggest that specific quinone derivatives could modulate this activity. In fact, we demonstrated a significant stimulation of Nox4 activity by 4 quinone derivatives (AA-861, tBuBHQ, tBuBQ, and duroquinone) observed in 3 different cellular models, HEK293E, T-REx , and chondrocyte cell lines. Our results indicate that the effect is specific toward Nox4 versus Nox2. Furthermore, we showed that NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) may participate in this stimulation. Interestingly, Nox4 activity is also stimulated by reducing agents that possibly act by reducing the disulfide bridge (Cys226, Cys270) located in the extracellular E-loop of Nox4. Such model of Nox4 activity regulation could provide new insight into the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the electron transfer through the enzyme, i.e., its potential redox regulation, and could also define new therapeutic targets in diseases in which quinones and Nox4 are implicated.

12217700|t|Enzymatic catalysis in crystals of Escherichia coli maltodextrin phosphorylase.
12217700|a|The bacterial enzyme maltodextrin phosphorylase (MalP) catalyses the phosphorolysis of an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond in maltodextrins, removing the non-reducing glucosyl residues of linear oligosaccharides as glucose-1-phosphate (Glc1P). In contrast to the well-studied muscle glycogen phosphorylase (GP), MalP exhibits no allosteric properties and has a higher affinity for linear oligosaccharides than GP. We have used MalP as a model system to study catalysis in the crystal in the direction of maltodextrin synthesis. The 2.0A crystal structure of the MalP/Glc1P binary complex shows that the Glc1P substrate adopts a conformation seen previously with both inactive and active forms of mammalian GP, with the phosphate group not in close contact with the 5'-phosphate group of the essential pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) cofactor. In the active MalP enzyme, the residue Arg569 stabilizes the negative-charged Glc1P, whereas in the inactive form of GP this key residue is held away from the catalytic site by loop 280s and an allosteric transition of the mammalian enzyme is required for activation. The comparison between MalP structures shows that His377, through a hydrogen bond with the 6-hydroxyl group of Glc1P substrate, triggers a conformational change of the 380s loop. This mobile region folds over the catalytic site and contributes to the specific recognition of the oligosaccharide and to the synergism between substrates in promoting the formation of the MalP ternary complex. The structures solved after the diffusion of oligosaccharides (either maltotetraose, G4 or maltopentaose, G5) into MalP/Glc1P crystals show the formation of phosphate and elongation of the oligosaccharide chain. These structures, refined at 1.8A and at 2.2A, confirm that only when an oligosaccharide is bound to the catalytic site will Glc1P bend its phosphate group down so it can contact the PLP 5' phosphate group and promote catalysis. The relatively large oligosaccharide substrates can diffuse quickly into the MalP/Glc1P crystals and the enzymatic reaction can occur without significant crystal damage. These structures obtained before and after catalysis have been used as frames of a molecular movie. This movie reveals the relative positions of substrates in the catalytic channel and shows a minimal movement of the protein, involving mainly Arg569, which tracks the substrate phosphate group.

16516814|t|Involvement of EP1 and EP2 receptors in the regulation of the Na,K-ATPase by prostaglandins in MDCK cells.
16516814|a|Prostaglandins are key regulators of ion transport in the kidney. In MDCK cells, which model distal tubule cells, the transcription of the Na,K-ATPase beta1 subunit is regulated by PGE1 and PGE2. To identify the EP receptors that mediate transcriptional regulation, transient transfection studies are conducted using the human beta1promoter/luciferase construct, pHbeta1-1141 Luc. The involvement of EP1 and EP2 receptors is indicated by studies with the EP1 selective agonist 17-phenyl trinor PGE2, and the EP2 selective agonist butaprost (which stimulate), as well as by studies with the antagonists SC-51089 (EP1 specific) and AH 6809 (EP1 and EP2 specific). Consistent with the involvement of Gs coupled EP2 receptors, is that the PGE1 stimulation is inhibited by the PKAI expression vector (encoding the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitory protein), as well as by the myristolated PKA inhibitory peptide PKI. In addition to this evidence (for the involvement of EP2 receptors), evidence for the involvement of EP1 receptors in the PGE1 mediated stimulation of Na,K-ATPase beta subunit gene transcription includes the stimulatory effect of 17-phenyl trinor PGE2, as well as the inhibitory effects of SC-51089. Also consistent with the involvement of Gq coupled EP1 receptors, the PGE1 stimulation is inhibited by the PKCI vector (encoding the PKC inhibitory domain), the PKC inhibitor Go 6976, thapsigargin, as well as the calmodulin antagonists W7 and W13.

10999950|t|Mechanisms of agonist-induced down-regulation of the human kappa-opioid receptor: internalization is required for down-regulation.
10999950|a|Previously, we showed that the human kappa-opioid receptor (hkor) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells underwent down-regulation after prolonged U50,488H treatment. In the present study, we determined the mechanisms underlying this process. U50, 488H caused a significant down-regulation of the hkor, although etorphine did not. Neither U50,488H nor etorphine caused down-regulation of the rat kappa-opioid receptor. Thus, similar to internalization, there are agonist and species differences in down-regulation of kappa-opioid receptors. Expression of the dominant negative mutants arrestin-2(319-418) or dynamin I-K44A significantly reduced U50,488H-induced down-regulation of the hkor. Coexpression of GRK2 or GRK2 and arrestin-2 permitted etorphine to induce down-regulation of the hkor, although expression of arrestin-2 or dynamin I alone did not. Expression of the dominant negative mutants rab5A-N133I or rab7-N125I blunted U50,488H-induced down-regulation. Pretreatment with lysosomal enzyme inhibitors [(2S, 3S)trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester or chloroquine] or proteasome inhibitors (proteasome inhibitor I, MG-132, or lactacystin) decreased the extent of U50,488H-induced down-regulation. A combination of chloroquine and proteasome inhibitor I abolished U50,488H-induced down-regulation. These results indicate that U50,488H-induced down-regulation of the hkor involves GRK-, arrestin-2-, dynamin-, rab5-, and rab7-dependent mechanisms and receptors seem to be trafficked to lysosomes and proteasomes for degradation. Thus, U50,488H-induced internalization and down-regulation of the hkor share initial common mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the first report on the involvement of both rab5 and rab7 in agonist-induced down-regulation of a G protein-coupled receptor. In addition, this study is among the first to show the involvement of proteasomes in agonist-induced down-regulation of a G protein-coupled receptor.

23466460|t|Membranar effects exerted in vitro by polyphenols - quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate and curcumin - on HUVEC and Jurkat cells, relevant for diabetes mellitus.
23466460|a|Polyphenols are largely studied for their beneficial action in various pathologies, but the correlation with their effects on cell membranes is still elusive. In the present study we assessed the effects exerted in vitro by quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate and curcumin on membrane fluidity and transmembrane potential of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and Jurkat T lymphoblasts, in experimental conditions mimicking diabetes mellitus, i.e. high glucose conditions or increased concentration of advanced glycation end products. Results showed that the investigated polyphenols had beneficial effects on cell membranes altered in diabetic conditions, by restoring transmembrane potential and by membrane "stiffening". Moreover, they limited the release of pro-inflammatory factors, like monocyte chemotactic protein-1. These effects were more obvious for cells exposed to advanced glycation end products specific for the late stages of diabetes. Apparently, the inhibitory action of polyphenols on lipid peroxidation was associated with a decrease of membrane fluidity. Concluding, our in vitro study highlighted the potential beneficial action of polyphenols mainly in the late stages of diabetes, exerted at the level of membrane fluidity and transmembrane potential, accompanied by an anti-inflammatory effect on endothelial and immune cells.

23347684|a|2-(4-Chloro-2-cyano-2-phenylbutyl)aziridines were employed for the one-step stereoselective construction of both endo- and exo-2-aminomethyl-4-phenyl-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes as new azaheterobicyclic scaffolds via a double LiAlH(4)-induced reductive cyclization protocol. Antiplasmodial assessment of these 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes revealed moderate to good activities in the micromolar range, with the exo-isomers being the most promising structures. Furthermore, the proposed mode of action was supported by ligand docking studies, pointing to a strong binding interaction with the enzyme plasmepsin II.

17224860|t|Effect of isolated isoflavone supplementation on ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux potential in postmenopausal women.
17224860|a|OBJECTIVE: Isoflavones may display beneficial health effects in postmenopausal women. We studied in a clinical trial whether isolated isoflavone treatment in postmenopausal women could affect reverse cholesterol transport as evaluated by adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette A1- (ABCA1), dependent cholesterol efflux from macrophages. In addition, various serum lipid and lipoprotein parameters were investigated. Furthermore, we separately assessed equol-producing and non-equol-producing women. DESIGN: Postmenopausal women (n=56) were treated with either isoflavone or placebo tablets for 3 months in a crossover design, separated by a 2-month washout period. Fifteen women were classified as equol producers, and 15 women were classified as non-equol producers. Serum samples were collected before and after each treatment period. [H]-Cholesterol-labeled J774 macrophage cells, with and without ABCA1 up-regulation, were incubated with the samples, and ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux and serum lipid and lipoprotein levels were assessed. RESULTS: Serum promoted 3.1%+/-1.1% and 3.2%+/-1.1% cholesterol efflux from macrophages after isoflavone and placebo treatment, respectively. Thus, isoflavone supplementation did not affect ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux to serum. However, as a novel finding, isoflavone treatment increased a subclass of high-density lipoprotein, the pre-beta high-density lipoprotein levels by 18% without affecting any other serum lipid concentrations. ABCA1-facilitated cholesterol efflux and lipid parameters did not differ between equol-producing and non-equol-producing women. CONCLUSION: In postmenopausal women, isolated isoflavone treatment does not affect ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux potential from macrophages but increases circulating pre-beta high-density lipoprotein level, which could provide beneficial vascular effects.

23360475|t|Design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship studies of tryptanthrins as antitubercular agents.
23360475|a|The natural product tryptanthrin (1a) represents a potential lead for new tuberculosis (TB) drugs since tryptanthrin and its synthetic analogues possess potent in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However, in spite of their in vitro activity, none of these agents have been shown to be efficacious in vivo against animal models of TB. Described herein are syntheses of new tryptanthrin analogues together with a systematic investigation of their in vitro antitubercular activity and ADME properties followed by pharmacokinetic characterization in rodents for the most promising compounds. Those with the best potency and oral bioavailability were progressed to evaluations of efficacy against acute murine TB. The work aimed to prove the concept that this compound class can limit growth of Mtb during infection as well as to establish the SAR for in vitro activity against Mtb and the range of in vitro ADME parameters for this class of natural products. Novel C-11-deoxy (5b) and A-ring-saturated (6) tryptanthrin analogues were discovered that maintained activity against Mtb and showed improved solubility compared to tryptanthrin as well as evidence of oral bioavailability in rodents. However, neither 5b nor 6 demonstrated efficacy against acute murine TB following administration at doses up to 400 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Although 5b and 6 failed to inhibit replication or kill Mtb in vivo, they illuminate a path to new structural variations of the tryptanthrin scaffold that may maximize the potential of this class of compounds against TB.

22874922|t|Novel non-canonical TGF-b signaling networks: emerging roles in airway smooth muscle phenotype and function.
22874922|a|The airway smooth muscle (ASM) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). ASM cells express a wide range of receptors involved in contraction, growth, matrix protein production and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) is one of the major players in determining the structural and functional abnormalities of the ASM in asthma and COPD. It is increasingly evident that TGF-b functions as a master switch, controlling a network of intracellular and autocrine signaling loops that effect ASM phenotype and function. In this review, the various elements that participate in non-canonical TGF-b signaling, including MAPK, PI3K, WNT/b-catenin, and Ca(2+), are discussed, focusing on their effect on ASM phenotype and function. In addition, new aspects of ASM biology and their possible association with non-canonical TGF-b signaling will be discussed.

23152186|t|Arsenic activates endothelin-1 Gi protein-coupled receptor signaling to inhibit stem cell differentiation in adipogenesis.
23152186|a|Dysfunctional lipid and glucose metabolism contribute to metabolic syndrome-a major public health concern that enhances cardiovascular disease risk. Arsenic (As(III)) exposure may increase metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease risk by impairing adipose tissue differentiation, function, and insulin sensitivity through pathogenic mechanisms that remain unclear. We hypothesized that As(III) signals through the Pertussis toxin (Ptx) sensitive, Gi protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) to impair adipogenesis, as previously demonstrated for its stimulation of vascular oxidant generation, angiogenesis, and remodeling. Because both As(III) and GPCR ligands inhibit progenitor cell differentiation into adipocytes, we investigated the hypothesis in a model of low-passage human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). As(III) (0.1-1.0 uM) suppressed dexamethasone/insulin-induced hMSC adipogenesis, as indicated by decreased transcriptional promoters of differentiation, decreased fat droplet formation, and decreased expression of differentiated adipocyte markers, such as adiponectin and perilipin. Preincubating hMSC with Ptx prevented 90% of the suppressive effect of As(III). Selective competitive antagonists of Gi-coupled endothelin-1 type A and B receptors were ~60% effective in blocking As(III) inhibition and combination of antagonists to both receptors were 85% effective. In contrast, antagonists to the sphingosine-1-phosphate type 1 receptor (previously shown to mediate As(III) vascular effects) or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor were ineffective in blocking As(III) effects. These studies suggest a majority of arsenic-inhibited adipocyte differentiation, and metabolism requires endothelin-1 GPCRs and that As(III) effects on GPCR signaling are tissue and context specific. This may represent a significant mechanism for the contribution of arsenic exposure to increased metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.

22370641|t|WNT6 is a novel target gene of caveolin-1 promoting chemoresistance to epirubicin in human gastric cancer cells.
22370641|a|Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle for curative treatment of human gastric cancer (GC). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Wingless-type MMTV integration site family members (WNTs) are secreted glycoproteins involved in embryogenesis and, on inappropriate expression in the adult, in cancer. Here, we show expression of WNT6 in GC patient specimens, human GC cell lines and in a mouse model of GC. In human GC cells, WNT6 expression was enhanced by caveolin-1 (Cav1), a scaffold protein of plasma membrane caveolae. WNT6 knock-down and overexpression experiments demonstrated that WNT6 increased the resistance to apoptotic cell death induced by the anthracycline chemotherapeutics epirubicin (Epi) and doxorubicin (Dox). Epi increased the activity of the human WNT6 promoter through Cav1-dependent binding of b-catenin to the proximal WNT6 promoter. Epi increased both WNT6/Wnt6 and Cav1 expression in human GC cells and within the tumor area of a murine model of GC (CEA424-SV40 TAg). In GC patients, WNT6 expression was positively associated with the tumor stage and the nodal status, and inversely correlated with the response to ECF (Epi, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy. These results showed that WNT6 and Cav1 are upregulated by chemotherapeutics and enhance the resistance of GC cells to anthracycline drugs. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving WNT6/Cav1-induced drug resistance will provide benefits in developing new therapies for GC.

23363083|t|Computationally assisted assignment of kahalalide Y configuration using an NMR-constrained conformational search.
23363083|a|Assignment of the absolute configuration of cyclic peptides frequently yields challenges, leaving one or more stereogenic centers unassigned due to small quantities of sample and the limited utility of Marfey's or other methods for assigning amino or hydroxy acids. Here, we report isolation of kahalalide Y (1) from Bryopsis pennata for the first time; in addition, the application of a combination of molecular modeling and NOE distance constraint calculations was utilized to determine the conformation of 1 and the absolute configuration of the final stereogenic center of 1. Using the Schrodinger suite, the structure of 1 was sketched in Maestro and minimized using the OPLS2005 force field in Macromodel. A conformational search was performed separately for structures having an R or S configuration at C-3 of the beta-hydroxy fatty acid subunit that completes the cyclic scaffold of 1, after which multiple minimizations for all generated conformers were carried out. The lowest energy conformers of R and S stereoisomers were then subjected to B3LYP geometry optimizations including solvent effects. The S stereoisomer was shown to be in excellent agreement with the NOE-derived distance constraints and hydrogen-bonding stability studies.

9204085|t|Pharmacology and chemistry of adapalene.
9204085|a|BACKGROUND: Retinoid research in the field of dermatology has been influenced by the clinical success of topical tretinoin and oral isotretinoin in the treatment of acne, and by the discovery of high-affinity binding proteins for retinoic acid mediating its action and interaction with other vitamins and hormones. OBJECTIVE: We sought molecules with an optimal balance between stability, efficacy, and local tolerance for topical acne therapy. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo bioassay systems were used to test the ability of retinoids to modulate cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, antiinflammatory properties were assessed. Binding and transactivation assays were used to compare affinities and transcriptional activities of adapalene and tretinoin for the nuclear transcription factors, retinoic acid receptors (RARs). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Adapalene is a stable naphthoic acid derivative with potent retinoid pharmacology, controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition it has significant antiinflammatory action. The nuclear gene transcription factors RAR beta and RAR gamma mediate the retinoid activity of adapalene.

23434647|t|The Interaction of Adrenomedullin and Macrophages Induces Ovarian Cancer Cell Migration via Activation of RhoA Signaling Pathway.
23434647|a|Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are correlated with poor prognosis in many human cancers; however, the mechanism by which TAMs facilitate ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion remains unknown. This study was aimed to examine the function of adrenomedullin (ADM) in macrophage polarization and their further effects on the migration of ovarian cancer cells. Exogenous ADM antagonist and small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for ADM expression were treated to macrophages and EOC cell line HO8910, respectively. Then macrophages were cocultured with HO8910 cells without direct contact. Flow cytometry, Western blot and real-time PCR were used to detect macrophage phenotype and cytokine production. The migration ability and cytoskeleton rearrangement of ovarian cancer cells were determined by Transwell migration assay and phalloidin staining. Western blot was performed to evaluate the activity status of signaling molecules in the process of ovarian cancer cell migration. The results showed that ADM induced macrophage phenotype and cytokine production similar to TAMs. Macrophages polarized by ADM promoted the migration and cytoskeleton rearrangement of HO8910 cells. The expression of RhoA and its downstream effector, cofilin, were upregulated in macrophage-induced migration of HO8910 cells. In conclusion, ADM could polarize macrophages similar to TAMs, and then polarized macrophages promote the migration of ovarian cancer cells via activation of RhoA signaling pathway in vitro.

16938288|t|Telmisartan downregulates angiotensin II type 1 receptor through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.
16938288|a|OBJECTIVE: Telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist, was found to have a unique property: it is a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Since previous studies have demonstrated that PPARgamma activators suppressed AT1R expression, we examined whether telmisartan affects AT1R expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. METHODS: Vascular smooth muscle cells were derived from the thoracic aorta of Wistar-Kyoto rat. Northern and Western blotting analysis were used to examine AT1R mRNA and protein expression, respectively. The DEAE-dextran method was used for transfection, and the promoter activity of AT1R was examined by luciferase assay. RESULTS: Telmisartan decreased the expression of AT1R at the mRNA and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Decreased AT1R promoter activity with unchanged mRNA stability suggested that telmisartan suppressed AT1R gene expression at the transcriptional level. However, the expression of AT1R was not suppressed by other AT1R antagonists such as candesartan or olmesartan. Since the suppression of AT1R expression was prevented by pretreatment with GW9662, a PPARgamma antagonist, PPARgamma should have participated in the process. The deletion and mutation analysis of the AT1R gene promoter indicated that a GC box located in the proximal promoter region is responsible for the telmisartan-induced downregulation. CONCLUSION: Our data provides a novel insight into an effect of telmisartan: telmisartan inhibits AT1R gene expression through PPARgamma activation. The dual inhibition of angiotensin II function by telmisartan - AT1R blockade and downregulation - would contribute to more complete inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.

23459167|t|Differential phosphoproteome of the striatum from pleiotrophin knockout and midkine knockout mice treated with amphetamine: Correlations with amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.
23459167|a|The neurotrophic factors pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK) have been shown to modulate amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Accordingly, PTN-/- and MK-/- mice show an increased vulnerability to amphetamine-induced neurotoxic effects. In an effort to uncover new pharmacological targets to prevent amphetamine neurotoxic effects, we have now used a proteomic approach to study protein phosphorylation, in which we combined phosphoprotein enrichment, by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, in order to identify the phosphoproteins regulated in the striatum of PTN-/-, MK-/- and wild type (WT) mice treated with amphetamine. We identified 13 differentially expressed phosphoproteins that are judged to be relevant in the neuroprotective roles of PTN and MK against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. It is very interesting to note that 4 of these phosphoproteins, annexin A7 (ANXA7), COP9 signalosome subunit 5 (COPS5), aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A1 (ALDH1A1) and creatine kinase U-type (CKMT1), are known to be involved in Parkinson's disease, a result of significant importance since PTN and MK have been also demonstrated to limit Parkinson's disease (PD) progress and have been suggested to be among the important genetic factors possibly preventing the development of PD in methamphetamine abusers. The data identify phosphoproteins differentially regulated by amphetamine treatment and/or the presence of endogenous PTN/MK which may be relevant mediators of PTN/MK neuroprotective effects against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. The data support further studies to validate the phosphoproteins here identified as possible new pharmacological targets to prevent amphetamine neurotoxic effects.

11742712|t|Gemcitabine and pemetrexed disodium combinations in vitro and in vivo.
11742712|a|Pemetrexed disodium (ALIMTA) is a novel antimetabolite that inhibits at least three folate-dependent enzymes, thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. Pemetrexed disodium is broadly active in a wide variety of solid tumours, including non-small cell lung, breast, bladder, head and neck and ovarian cancers. Gemcitabine is a broadly active pyrimidine nucleoside antimetabolite, which is approved for the treatment of pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. Three preclinical studies have been reported that show cytotoxic synergy between gemcitabine and pemetrexed. Clinical activity with this combination has been observed in a phase I study, with partial responses in three of five patients previously treated for non-small cell lung cancer. An international phase II study of this combination in non-small cell lung cancer is ongoing.

23519153|t|The early molecular processes underlying the neurological manifestations of an animal model of Wilson's disease.
23519153|a|The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat shows age-dependent hepatic manifestations that are similar to those of Wilson's disease (WD). The pathogenic process in the brain has, however, not been evaluated in detail due to the rarity of the neurological symptoms. However, copper accumulation is noted in LEC rat brain tissue from 24 weeks of age, which results in oxidative injuries. The current study investigated the gene expression profiles of LEC rat brains at 24 weeks of age in order to identify the important early molecular changes that underlie the development of neurological symptoms in WD. Biological ontology-based analysis revealed diverse altered expressions of the genes related to copper accumulation. Of particular interest, we found altered expression of genes connected to mitochondrial respiration (Sdhaf2 and Ndufb7), calcineurin-mediated cellular processes (Ppp3ca, Ppp3cb, and Camk2a), amyloid precursor protein (Anks1b and A2m) and alpha-synuclein (Snca). In addition to copper-related changes, compensatory upregulations of Cp and Hamp reflect iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Of note, reciprocal expression of Asmt and Bhmt is an important clue that altered S-adenosylhomocysteine metabolism underlies brain injury in WD, which is directly correlated to the decreased expression of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in hepatic tissue in LEC rats. In conclusion, our study indicates that diverse molecular changes, both variable and complex, underlie the development of neurological manifestations in WD. Copper-related injuries were found to be the principal pathogenic process, but Fe- or adenosylhomocysteine-related injuries were also implicated. Investigations using other animal models or accessible human samples will be required to confirm our observations.

11858481|t|Efficacy and safety of the factor VIII/von Willebrand factor concentrate, haemate-P/humate-P: ristocetin cofactor unit dosing in patients with von Willebrand disease.
11858481|a|The present study was initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Haemate-P (Humate-P in North America) (anti-hemophilic FVIII/VWF complex [human] dried, pasteurized) dosed in ristocetin cofactor units (VWF:RCo) in the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD) patients in Canada. This retrospective data collection reviewed the medical records of VWD patients treated under the Canadian Emergency Drug Release Program from November 22, 1991, to April 30, 1996. Data collection was accomplished by on-site retrieval from source data for 97 patients. Dosing was based on the German package insert, which lists only Factor VIII:C (FVIII:C) units, which were converted in the study analysis to VWF:RCo units based on the analysis of the individual manufactured lots of product used in these patients (average ratio of 2.6 IU VWF:RCo per IU FVIII:C). Twenty five different lots of Haemate-P/Humate-P were used to treat 437 different events in the 97 study patients (344 hemorrhagic events, 73 surgical interventions and 20 prophylactic infusion cycles). Overall, the median dose of concentrate per infusion used to treat surgical events was 69.1 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range 11.9-222.8); bleeding events 55.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range 17.1-227.5) and prophylaxis 41.6 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range 34.6-81.0). Treatment periods varied, with the majority of events treated for < or = 10 days (91%). Fifty percent of events that were treated longer than 10 days were given for prophylactic reasons. Efficacy was determined in a standardized manner by the physician, based on dosing in VWF:RCo activity. An overall clinical result of "excellent" or "good" was reported in 97% (424/437) of treatment events. A pediatric sub-population analysis of the patient population reported "excellent/good" efficacy in 100% (17/17) of treatment events in infants, 95% (155/164) in children, and 94% (76/81) in adolescent patients. Related adverse events (AEs) were observed in only 4 (4%) patients and were not deemed to be serious. The findings in this study confirm the safety and efficacy of Haemate-P/Humate-P using VWF:RCo dosing in pediatric and adult patients with various types of VWD.

17040106|t|Reductive detoxification of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens by human NADH cytochrome b5 reductase and cytochrome b5.
17040106|a|Heterocyclic and aromatic amine carcinogens are thought to lead to tumor initiation via the formation of DNA adducts, and bioactivation to arylhydroxylamine metabolites is necessary for reactivity with DNA. Carcinogenic arylhydroxylamine metabolites are cleared by a microsomal, NADH-dependent, oxygen-insensitive reduction pathway in humans, which may be a source of interindividual variability in response to aromatic amine carcinogens. The purpose of this study was to characterize the identity of this reduction pathway in human liver. On the basis of our findings with structurally similar arylhydroxylamine metabolites of therapeutic drugs, we hypothesized that the reductive detoxification of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens was catalyzed by NADH cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R) and cytochrome b5 (cyt b5). We found that reduction of the carcinogenic hydroxylamines of the aromatic amine 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP; found in cigarette smoke) and the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP; found in grilled meats) was indeed catalyzed by a purified system containing only human b5R and cyt b5. Specific activities were 56-346-fold higher in the purified system as compared to human liver microsomes (HLM), with similar Michaelis-Menten constants (K(m) values) in both systems. The stoichiometry for b5R and cyt b5 that yielded the highest activity in the purified system was also similar to that found in native HLM ( approximately 1:8 to 1:10). Polyclonal antisera to either b5R or cyt b5 significantly inhibited N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl (NHOH-4-ABP) reduction by 95 and 89%, respectively, and immunoreactive cyt b5 protein content in individual HLM was significantly correlated with individual reduction of both NHOH-4-ABP and N-hydroxy-PhIP (NHOH-PhIP). Finally, titration of HLM into the purified b5R/cyt b5 system did not enhance the efficiency of reduction activity. We conclude that b5R and cyt b5 are together solely capable of the reduction of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens, and we further hypothesize that this pathway may be a source of individual variability with respect to cancer susceptibility following 4-ABP or PhIP exposure.

23188819|t|Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE): a novel heat shock-like protein.
23188819|a|Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a highly conserved zinc metallopeptidase that is ubiquitously distributed in human tissues, and particularly abundant in the brain, liver, and muscles. IDE activity has been historically associated with insulin and b-amyloid catabolism. However, over the last decade, several experimental findings have established that IDE is also involved in a wide variety of physiopathological processes, including ubiquitin clearance and Varicella Zoster Virus infection. In this study, we demonstrate that normal and malignant cells exposed to different stresses markedly up-regulate IDE in a heat shock protein (HSP)-like fashion. Additionally, we focused our attention on tumor cells and report that (i) IDE is overexpressed in vivo in tumors of the central nervous system (CNS); (ii) IDE-silencing inhibits neuroblastoma (SHSY5Y) cell proliferation and triggers cell death; (iii) IDE inhibition is accompanied by a decrease of the poly-ubiquitinated protein content and co-immunoprecipitates with proteasome and ubiquitin in SHSY5Y cells. In this work, we propose a novel role for IDE as a heat shock protein with implications in cell growth regulation and cancer progression, thus opening up an intriguing hypothesis of IDE as an anticancer target.

2530096|t|Effect of minaprine on cycloheximide-induced amnesia in mice.
2530096|a|The effects of minaprine on cycloheximide-induced amnesia were investigated in a step-down passive avoidance task in mice. Minaprine significantly improved cycloheximide-induced amnesia. This effect was inhibited by scopolamine, but was potentiated by physostigmine. The anti-amnesic effect of minaprine on the cycloheximide-induced memory impairment was also antagonized by a serotonin (5-HT) releaser, p-chloroamphetamine, and by a 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan, whereas a 5-HT1A-selective agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, was inactive. The memory-improving effect of minaprine on cycloheximide-induced amnesia was potentiated by a selective 5-HT2 antagonist, ritanserin. These results suggest that the beneficial effect of minaprine on cycloheximide-induced amnesia may be related not only to cholinergic but also serotonergic neuronal systems (5-HT2 receptors).

23608535|t|MAPKAPK2/3 Regulate SERCA2a Expression and Fiber Type Composition to Modulate Skeletal Muscle and Cardiomyocyte Function.
23608535|a|The MAPK-activated protein kinases 2 and 3 (MAPKAPK2/3, MK2/3) represent protein kinases downstream of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Using MK2/3 double knockout mice (MK2/3(-/-)), we analyzed the role of MK2/3 in cross-striated muscle by transcriptome and proteome analyses, and by histology. We demonstrated enhanced expression of the slow oxidative skeletal muscle myofiber gene program, including the PPARg coactivator 1a (PGC-1a). Using reporter gene and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays we demonstrated that MK2 catalytic activity directly regulated the promoters of the fast fiber-specific myosin heavy chain IId/x and the slow fiber-specific sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) 2 gene. Elevated SERCA2a gene expression caused by a decreased transcription factor Egr-1 to Sp1 ratio was associated with accelerated relaxation and enhanced contractility in MK2/3(-/-) cardiomyocytes, concomitant with improved force parameters in MK2/3(-/-) soleus muscle. These results link MK2/3 to the regulation of calcium dynamics and identify enzymatic activity of MK2/3 as a critical factor for modulating cross-striated muscle function by generating a unique muscle phenotype exhibiting both, reduced fatigability and enhanced force in MK2/3(-/-) mice. Hence, the p38-MK2/3 axis may represent a novel target for the design of therapeutic strategies for diseases related to fiber type changes or impaired SERCA2 function.

12181285|t|Organic cation transporter mRNA and function in the rat superior cervical ganglion.
12181285|a|Reuptake of extracellular noradrenaline (NA) into superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurones is mediated by means of the noradrenaline transporter (NAT, uptake 1). We now demonstrate by single-cell RT-PCR that mRNA of the organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3, uptake 2) occurs in rat SCG neurones as well. Furthermore, our RT-PCR analyses reveal the presence of mRNA for novel organic cation transporters 1 and 2 (OCTN1 and OCTN2), but not for OCT1 or OCT2 in the ganglion. Making use of the NAT as a powerful, neurone-specific transporter system, we loaded[3H]-N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ([3H]-MPP+) into cultured rat SCG neurones. The ensuing radioactive outflow from these cultures was enhanced by desipramine and reserpine, but reduced (in the presence of desipramine) by the OCT3 inhibitors cyanine 863, oestradiol and corticosterone. In contrast, cyanine 863 enhanced the radioactive outflow from cultures preloaded with [3H]-NA. Two observations suggest that a depletion of storage vesicles by cyanine 863 accounts for the latter phenomenon: first, the primary radioactive product isolated from supernatants of cultures loaded with [3H]-NA was the metabolite [3H]-DHPG; and second, inhibition of MAO significantly reduced the radioactive outflow in response to cyanine 863. The outflow of [3H]-MPP+ was significantly enhanced by MPP+, guanidine, choline and amantadine as potential substrates for OCT-related transmembrane transporters. However, desipramine at a low concentration essentially blocked the radioactive outflow induced by all of these substances with the exception of MPP+, indicating the NAT and not an OCT as their primary site of action. The MPP+-induced release of [3H]-MPP+ was fully prevented by a combined application of desipramine and cyanine 863. No trans-stimulation of [3H]-MPP+ outflow was observed by the OCTN1 and OCTN2 substrate carnitine at 100 microM. Our observations indicate an OCT-mediated transmembrane transport of [3H]-MPP+. Amongst the three OCTs expressed in the SCG, OCT3 best fits the profile of substrates and antagonists that cause trans-stimulation and trans-inhibition, respectively, of [3H]-MPP+ release.

23063069|t|Parental exposure to natural mixtures of POPs reduced embryo production and altered gene transcription in zebrafish embryos.
23063069|a|Determination of toxicity of complex mixtures has been proposed to be one of the most important challenges for modern toxicology. In this study we performed genome wide transcriptome profiling to assess potential toxicant induced changes in gene regulation in zebrafish embryos following parental exposure to two natural mixtures of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The mixtures used were extracted from burbot (Lota lota) liver originating from two lakes (Lake Mj0sa and Lake Losna) belonging to the same freshwater system in Norway. The dominating groups of contaminants were polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane metabolites (DDTs). Because both mixtures used in the present study induced similar effects, it is likely that the same toxicants are involved. The Mj0sa mixture contains high levels of PBDEs while this group of pollutants is low in the Losna mixture. However, both mixtures contain substantial concentrations of PCB and DDT suggesting these contaminants as the predominant contributors to the toxicity observed. The observed effects included phenotypic traits, like embryo production and survival, and gene transcription changes corresponding with disease and biological functions such as cancer, reproductive system disease, cardiovascular disease, lipid and protein metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and cell cycle. The changes in gene transcription included genes regulated by HNF4A, insulin, LH, FSH and NF-kB which are known to be central regulators of endocrine signaling, metabolism, metabolic homeostasis, immune functions, cancer development and reproduction. The results suggest that relative low concentrations of the natural mixtures of POPs used in the present study might pose a threat to wild freshwater fish living in the lakes from which the POPs mixtures originated.

23344956|t|Depletion of molecular chaperones from the endoplasmic reticulum and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus associated with pathogenesis in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.
23344956|a|Missense mutations in the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene cause a wide spectrum of hypomyelinating disorders, from mild spastic paraplegia type 2 to severe Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). Mutant PLP1 accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress. However, the link between the clinical severity of PMD and the cellular response induced by mutant PLP1 remains largely unknown. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER generally leads to up-regulation of ER chaperones to alleviate ER stress. Here, we found that expression of the PLP1-A243V mutant, which causes severe disease, depletes some ER chaperones with a KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) motif, in HeLa cells, MO3.13 oligodendrocytic cells, and primary oligodendrocytes. The same PLP1 mutant also induces fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (GA). These organelle changes are less prominent in cells with milder disease-associated PLP1 mutants. Similar changes are also observed in cells expressing another disease-causing gene that triggers ER stress, as well as in cells treated with brefeldin A, which induces ER stress and GA fragmentation by inhibiting GA to ER trafficking. We also found that mutant PLP1 disturbs localization of the KDEL receptor, which transports the chaperones with the KDEL motif from the GA to the ER. These data show that PLP1 mutants inhibit GA to ER trafficking, which reduces the supply of ER chaperones and induces GA fragmentation. We propose that depletion of ER chaperones and GA fragmentation induced by mutant misfolded proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of inherited ER stress-related diseases and affect the disease severity.

23240892|t|Acid-degradable cationic poly(ketal amidoamine) for enhanced RNA interference in vitro and in vivo.
23240892|a|Efficient delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is one of major challenges in the successful applications of siRNA in clinic. In the present study, we report a new acid-degradable poly(ketal amidoamine) (PKAA) as a siRNA carrier, which has high delivery efficiency and low cytotoxicity. PKAA was designed to have acid-cleavable ketal linkages in the backbone of cationic biodegradable poly(amidoamine). PKAA efficiently self-assembled with siRNA to form nanocomplexes with a diameter of ~200 nm and slightly positive charges, which are stable under physiological conditions, but rapidly release siRNA at acidic pH. PKAA exhibited sufficient buffering capability and endosomolytic activity due mainly to the presence of secondary amine groups in its backbone and rapid degradation in acidic endosomes, leading to the enhanced release of siRNA to cytoplasm. Cell culture studies demonstrated that PKAA is capable of delivering anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-a siRNA to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages and significantly inhibits the expression of TNF-a. A mouse model of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver failure was used to evaluate in vivo siRNA delivery efficacy of PKAA. PKAA/anti-TNF-a siRNA nanocomplexes significantly reduced the ALT (alanine transaminase) and the hepatic cellular damages in APAP-intoxicated mice. We anticipate that acid-degradable PKAA has great potential as siRNA carriers based on its excellent biocompatibility, pH sensitivity, potential endosomolytic activity, and high delivery efficiency.

7773533|t|Mediation of noradrenaline-induced contractions of rat aorta by the alpha 1B-adrenoceptor subtype.
7773533|a|1. The subtypes of alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediating contractions to exogenous noradrenaline (NA) in rat aorta have been examined in both biochemical and functional studies. 2. Incubation of rat aortic membranes with the irreversible alpha 1B-adrenoceptor antagonist, chloroethylclonidine (CEC: 10 microM) did not change the KD of [3H]-prazosin binding in comparison to untreated membranes, but reduced by 88% the total number of binding sites (Bmax). 3. Contractions of rat aortic strips to NA after CEC (50 microM for 30 min) incubation followed by repetitive washing, showed a marked shift in the potency of NA and a partial reduction in the maximum response. The residual contractions to NA after CEC incubation were not affected by prazosin (10 nM). 4. The competitive antagonists prazosin, terazosin, (R)-YM-12617, phentolamine, 5-methylurapidil and spiperone inhibited contractions to NA with estimated pA2 values of 9.85, 8.54, 9.34, 7.71, 7.64 and 8.41, respectively. 5. The affinity of the same antagonists for the alpha 1A- and alpha 1B- adrenoceptors was evaluated by utilizing membranes from rat hippocampus pretreated with CEC, and rat liver, respectively. 5-Methylurapidil and phentolamine were confirmed as selective for the alpha 1A-adrenoceptors, whereas spiperone was alpha 1B-selective. 6. A significant correlation was found between the pA2 values of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists tested and their affinity for the alpha 1B-adrenoceptor subtype, but not for the alpha 1A-subtype. 7. In conclusion, these findings indicate that in rat aorta most of the contraction is mediated by alpha 1B-adrenoceptors, and that the potency (pA2) of an antagonist in this tissue should be related to its antagonistic effect on this subtype of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor population.

15795105|t|Effect of 5-azacytidine and procainamide on CD3-zeta chain expression in Jurkat T cells.
15795105|a|It has been observed that decrease of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) activity is associated with low content of the CD3-zeta (zeta) chain in T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex of T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. The CD3-zeta chain plays a pivotal role in intracellular signal transmission between TCR/CD3 complex and nuclei. The compounds 5'-azacytidine (AZC) and procainamide (PCA) belong to inhibitors of DNMT1, whose low activity correlates with increase in transcription of various genes. Using the reverse-transcription and real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) analysis, we indicated that AZC and PCA did not profoundly affect on CD3-zeta chain transcription in Jurkat T leukemia cells clone E6-1. However, the flowcytometric analysis revealed that AZC and PCA decreased intracellular contents of CD3-zeta chain in these cells in dose dependent manner. Our results suggest that decrease of DNMT1 activity may alter intracellular signal transmission without effect on transcription level of CD3-zeta chain.

23373704|t|Fast protein motions are coupled to enzyme H-transfer reactions.
23373704|a|Coupling of fast protein dynamics to enzyme chemistry is controversial and has ignited considerable debate, especially over the past 15 years in relation to enzyme-catalyzed H-transfer. H-transfer can occur by quantum tunneling, and the temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) has emerged as the "gold standard" descriptor of these reactions. The anomalous temperature dependence of KIEs is often rationalized by invoking fast motions to facilitate H-transfer, yet crucially, direct evidence for coupled motions is lacking. The fast motions hypothesis underpinning the temperature dependence of KIEs is based on inference. Here, we have perturbed vibrational motions in pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase (PETNR) by isotopic substitution where all non-exchangeable atoms were replaced with the corresponding heavy isotope ((13)C, (15)N, and (2)H). The KIE temperature dependence is perturbed by heavy isotope labeling, demonstrating a direct link between (promoting) vibrations in the protein and the observed KIE. Further we show that temperature-independent KIEs do not necessarily rule out a role for fast dynamics coupled to reaction chemistry. We show causality between fast motions and enzyme chemistry and demonstrate how this impacts on experimental KIEs for enzyme reactions.

1686208|t|Sedation and histamine H1-receptor antagonism: studies in man with the enantiomers of chlorpheniramine and dimethindene.
1686208|a|1. The effects of 10 mg (+)- and (-)-chlorpheniramine and 5 mg (+)- and (-)-dimethindene on daytime sleep latencies, digit symbol substitution and subjective assessments of mood and well-being were studied in 6 healthy young adult humans. Each subject also took 5 mg triprolidine hydrochloride as an active control and two placebos. 2. Daytime sleep latencies were reduced with triprolidine, (+)-chlorpheniramine and (-)-dimethindene, and subjects also reported that they felt more sleepy after (+)-chlorpheniramine and (-)-dimethindene. Performance on digit symbol substitution was impaired with (+)-chlorpheniramine. 3. Changes in measures with (-)-chlorpheniramine and (+)-dimethindene were not different from changes with placebo. 4. In the present study, changes in measures of drowsiness and performance were limited to the enantiomers with high affinity for the histamine H1-receptor. These findings strongly suggest that sedation can arise from H1-receptor antagonism alone, and provide further support for the belief that the histaminergic system is concerned with the regulation of alertness in man.

23357567|t|Formation of mainstream cigarette smoke constituents prioritized by the World Health Organization--yield patterns observed in market surveys, clustering and inverse correlations.
23357567|a|The WHO TobReg proposed mandating ceilings on selected smoke constituents determined from the market-specific median of nicotine-normalized yield distributions. Data validating this regulatory concept were obtained from essentially single-blend surveys. This process is strongly impacted by inverse correlations among yields. In the present study, 18 priority WHO smoke constituent yields (nicotine-normalized) were determined (using two smoking regimens) from 262 commercial brands including American, Virginia and local blends from 13 countries. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify yields patterns, clustering of blend types and the inverse correlations causing these clusters. Three principal components explain about 75% of total data variability. PC1 was sensitive to the relative levels of gas- and particle-phase compounds. PC2 and PC3 cluster American- and Virginia-blends, revealing inverse correlations: Nitrogen oxides and amino- or nitroso-aromatic compounds inversely correlate to either formaldehyde and acrolein, or benzo(a)pyrene and di-hydroxybenzenes. These results can be explained by reviewing the processes determining each components smoke delivery. Regulatory initiatives simultaneously targeting selected smoke constituents in markets with mixed blend styles will be strongly impacted by the inverse correlations described. It is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of such regulations on public health, considering the complex chemistry of cigarette smoke formation.

15291969|t|P2 receptor mRNA expression profiles in human lymphocytes, monocytes and CD34+ stem and progenitor cells.
15291969|a|BACKGROUND: Extracellular nucleotides (ATP, ADP, UTP and UDP) exert a wide range of biological effects in blood cells mediated by multiple ionotropic P2X receptors and G protein-coupled P2Y receptors. Although pharmacological experiments have suggested the presence of several P2 receptor subtypes on monocytes and lymphocytes, some results are contradictory. Few physiological functions have been firmly established to a specific receptor subtype, partly because of a lack of truly selective agonists and antagonists. This stimulated us to investigate the expression of P2X and P2Y receptors in human lymphocytes and monocytes with a newly established quantitative mRNA assay for P2 receptors. In addition, we describe for the first time the expression of P2 receptors in CD34+ stem and progenitor cells implicating a potential role of P2 receptors in hematopoietic lineage and progenitor/stem cell function. RESULTS: Using a quantitative mRNA assay, we assessed the hypothesis that there are specific P2 receptor profiles in inflammatory cells. The P2X4 receptor had the highest expression in lymphocytes and monocytes. Among the P2Y receptors, P2Y12 and P2Y2 had highest expression in lymphocytes, while the P2Y2 and P2Y13 had highest expression in monocytes. Several P2 receptors were expressed (P2Y2, P2Y1, P2Y12, P2Y13, P2Y11, P2X1, P2X4) in CD34+ stem and progenitor cells. CONCLUSIONS: The most interesting findings were the high mRNA expression of P2Y12 receptors in lymphocytes potentially explaining the anti-inflammatory effects of clopidogrel, P2Y13 receptors in monocytes and a previously unrecognised expression of P2X4 in lymphocytes and monocytes. In addition, for the first time P2 receptor mRNA expression patterns was studied in CD34+ stem and progenitor cells. Several P2 receptors were expressed (P2Y2, P2Y1, P2Y12, P2Y13, P2Y11, P2X1, P2X4), indicating a role in differentiation and proliferation. Thus, it is possible that specific antibodies to P2 receptors could be used to identify progenitors for monocytes, lymphocytes and megakaryocytes.

17320868|t|Neuroprotection by estrogen against MPP+-induced dopamine neuron death is mediated by ERalpha in primary cultures of mouse mesencephalon.
17320868|a|Estrogen involvement in neuroprotection is now widely accepted, although the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms of estrogen action in neuroprotection remain unclear. This study examines estrogenic effects in a mixed population of cells in attempts to identify the contributing cells that result in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection. Utilizing primary mesencephalic neurons, we found expression of both estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) with a predominance of ERalpha on both dopamine neurons and astrocytes. We also found that 17beta-estradiol protects dopamine neurons from injury induced by the complex I inhibitor, 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (MPP(+)) in a time- and ER-dependent manner. At least 4 h of estrogen pre-treatment was required to elicit protection, an effect that was blocked by the ER antagonist, ICI 182,780. Moreover, ERalpha mediated the protection afforded by estrogen since only the ERalpha agonist, HPTE, but not the ERbeta agonist, DPN, protected against dopamine cell loss. Since glial cells were shown to express significant levels of ERalpha, we investigated a possible indirect mechanism of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection through glial cell interaction. Removal of glial cells from the cultures by application of the mitotic inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, significantly reduced the neuroprotective effects of estrogen. These data indicate that neuroprotection provided by estrogen against MPP(+) toxicity is mediated by ERalpha and involves an interplay among at least two cell types.

15494035|t|Amylin receptors: molecular composition and pharmacology.
15494035|a|Several receptors which bind the hormone AMY (amylin) with high affinity have now been identified. The minimum binding unit is composed of the CT (calcitonin) receptor at its core, plus a RAMP (receptor activity modifying protein). The receptors have been named AMY(1(a)), AMY(2(a)) and AMY(3(a)) in accordance with the association of the CT receptor (CT((a))) with RAMP1, RAMP2 and RAMP3 respectively. The challenge is now to determine the localization and pharmacological nature of each of these receptors. Recent attempts to achieve these aims will be briefly discussed.

9299436|t|Adenosine deaminase is a specific partner for the Grb2 isoform Grb3-3.
9299436|a|Grb3-3 is an isoform of Grb2, thought to arise by alternative splicing, that lacks a functional SH2 domain but retains functional SH3 domains, which allow interaction with other proteins through binding to prolinerich sequences. Several evidences suggest that besides common partners for Grb2 and Grb3-3, specific targets could exist. In order to find specific partners for Grb3-3, we have screened a human cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system with Grb3-3 as a bait. We have identified adenosine deaminase, an enzyme involved in purine metabolism whose deficiency is associated with severe combined immunodeficiency, as a Grb3-3 binding protein that is not able to bind to Grb2. This interaction has been confirmed in vitro with GST fusion proteins and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with Grb3-3. The functional significance of this finding is discussed.

23598904|t|Suppression of ZIP8 expression is a common feature of cadmium-resistant and manganese-resistant RBL-2H3 cells.
23598904|a|Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells show markedly high sensitivity to both CdCl2 and MnCl2 compared with other rat cell lines, due to efficient accumulation of cadmium and manganese. To clarify the roles of metal transporters in hyperaccumulation of cadmium and manganese in RBL-2H3 cells, Cd-resistant and Mn-resistant cells were developed from RBL-2H3 cells by continuous exposure to CdCl2 and MnCl2, respectively. The established Cd-resistant (RBL-Cdr) and Mn-resistant (RBL-Mnr) cells exhibited about 20 times higher LC50 values of CdCl2 and MnCl2, respectively, than parental RBL-2H3 cells, and showed cross-resistance to each metal. The resistance to cadmium and manganese was primarily conferred by a marked decrease in the uptake of both metals. RBL-Cdr cells also showed cross-resistance to HgCl2 and AgNO3 probably due to enhanced expression of metallothionein. Among the possible transporters involved in the uptake of Cd(2+) and Mn(2+), the expression of ZIP8 (Zrt-, Irt-related protein 8), encoded by Slc39a8, showed a marked suppression in both RBL-Cdr and RBL-Mnr cells. These results suggest that ZIP8 plays a pivotal role in the transport and toxicity of Cd(2+) and Mn(2+) in RBL-2H3 cells.

17138644|t|The role of extranuclear signaling actions of progesterone receptor in mediating progesterone regulation of gene expression and the cell cycle.
17138644|a|Human progesterone receptor (PR) contains a motif that interacts with the SH3 domain of Src and mediates rapid activation of Src and downstream MAPK (Erk-1/-2) without relying on the transcriptional activity of the receptor. Here we investigated the role and intracellular location of this nontranscriptional activity of PR. Progestin activation of Src/MAPK occurred outside the nucleus with the B isoform of PR that was distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus, but not with PR-A that was predominantly nuclear. Breast cancer cells stably expressing wild-type PR-B or PR-B with disrupting point mutations in the SH3 domain binding motif (PR-BDeltaSH3) that do not affect the transcriptional activity of PR, were compared for effects of progestin on endogenous target gene expression and cell proliferation. Progestin induction of the cyclin D1 gene, which lacks a progesterone response element, was dependent on PR activation of the Src/MAPK pathway, whereas induction of the Sgk (serum and glucocorticoid regulated kinase) gene that contains a functional progesterone response element was unaffected by mutations that interfere with PR activation of Src. Progestin induction of cell cycle progression was also abrogated in cells expressing PR-BDeltaSH3, and no effect of progestin on cyclin D1 expression and cell cycle was observed in the presence of PR-A. These results highlight the importance of PR activation of the Src/MAPK signaling pathway for progesterone-induced transcription of select target genes and cell cycle progression.

23127600|t|Protective effect of cinnamon polyphenols against STZ-diabetic mice fed high-sugar, high-fat diet and its underlying mechanism.
23127600|a|This study was designed to investigate the potential effects of 14days' intragastrically given of cinnamon polyphenols (CPS) in treating diabetic mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (150mgkg(-1)) and fed high-sugar, high-fat diet. The diabetic mice model was successfully established through determining on fasting blood-glucose (FBG) test. As revealed by glucose oxidase (GOD) and radioimmunoassay (RIA), both dimethyldiguanide (DC, 0.6gkg(-1)d(-1)) and CPS (0.3, 0.6, 1.2gkg(-1)d(-1)) treatments significantly resulted in down-regulation of blood glucose and insulin levels in serum, while the levels of oxidative stress markers were markedly lowered through ELISA assay. Meanwhile, the pathological damage in islet with pancreatic beta cells was ameliorated by treatment of CPS at different doses, as shown in HE stain. At the same time, the treatments also caused notable reduction of iNOS, NF-kB expressions showing in Western blot analysis. These findings demonstrate that cinnamon polyphenols can exert the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects through the mechanisms that may be associated with repairing pancreatic beta cells in diabetic mice and improving its anti-oxidative capacity, as well as attenuating cytotoxicity via inhibition of iNOS, NF-kB activation.

23539511|t|Cardiac natriuretic Peptide gene expression and plasma concentrations during the first 72 hours of life in piglets.
23539511|a|Plasma measurement of cardiac natriuretic peptides constitutes promising markers of congenital heart disease. However, concentrations change rapidly and dramatically during the first days after delivery even in healthy neonates, which complicates clinical interpretation. It is unknown whether these changes in plasma concentrations are explained by corresponding changes in the cardiac gene expression. We quantified the chamber-specific mRNA levels of ANP (A-type natriuretic peptide) and BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) and plasma pro-ANP and BNP-32 concentrations in healthy piglets during the first 72 hours of life (from 2 litters, n = 44). Chamber-specific ANP and BNP mRNA levels reflected hemodynamic neonate changes at birth but did not correlate with circulating natriuretic peptide concentrations. However, plasma pro-ANP and creatinine concentrations were closely correlated (P < .0001; r = 0.73). Plasma pro-ANP levels were highest on the day of delivery (5580 pmol/L [4320-6786] decreasing to 2484 pmol/L [1602-2898] after 72 hours, P < .0001). During the 72 hours, gel chromatography suggested that the translational products in circulation and in atrial tissue were immature, ie, unprocessed pro-ANP. In contrast to pro-ANP, BNP-32 plasma concentrations were low at delivery and peaked after 48 hours (12 [10.5-20.6] vs. 88.8 [71.7-101.4] pmol/L, P < .0001). To conclude, ANP and BNP gene expression differs considerably between cardiac chambers in the first 72 hours of life in healthy piglets, resembling the transition from fetal to neonate circulation. However, the cardiac gene expression does not explain plasma concentrations.

23562365|t|Lignans extracted from Vitex negundo possess cytotoxic activity by G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction.
23562365|a|Evn-50 is a lignan compounds mixture extracted from Vitex negundo, a widely used herb in traditional Chinese medicine. This study is aimed to define the spectrum of cytotoxic activity of EVn-50, and also to investigate mechanisms underlying the anticancer actions via assessing the influence on cell cycle using EVn-50, and the lignan compound VB1 purified from EVn-50. The cytotoxic effect of EVn-50 and VB1 was determined with SRB assay using a panel of cancer cell lines. Breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435 and liver cancer cell line SMMC-7721 were selected for further evaluating the effect of EVn-50 or VB1 on cell cycle by flow cytometric analysis. Apoptosis exerted by EVn-50 or VB1 was measured by TUNEL assay and DAPI staining, and Western blot analysis was utilized to assess the influence on expression and phosphorylation of proteins which are closely related to cell cycle and apoptosis. EVn-50 possessed a broad spectrum of in vitro anticancer activity for those tested cancer cells, especially sensitive to MDA-MB-435, SKOV-3, BXPC-3, SMMC-7721, MCF-7, HO-8910, SGC-7901, BEL-7402, HCT-116, and 786-O, with the respective IC50 below 10ug/ml. Treatment with EVn-50 or VB1 resulted in arresting the MDA-MB-435 and SMMC-7721 cells at G2/M phase, which was further supported by observations of increased phosphorylation of Histone 3 at Ser10, phosphorylation of Cdk1 at Tyr15, expression of cyclin B1, and decreased expression of Cdc25c. Moreover, we found that exposure of MDA-MB-435 cells to EVn-50 or VB1 caused obvious apoptosis of MDA-MB-435 cells. Our data show that EVn-50, lignan compounds extracted from Vitex negundo, possesses a broad spectrum cytotoxic effect via arresting cancer cells at G2/M phase cell cycle and subsequently inducing apoptosis.

23572389|t|Hypermethylation of P15, P16, and E-cadherin genes in ovarian cancer.
23572389|a|Both p16 and p15 proteins are inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases that prevent the cell going through the G1/S phase transaction. E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates calcium-dependent interactions between adjacent epithelial cells. Two groups of patients were selected: the first group suffered from epithelial serous ovarian tumors and the second group suffered from benign ovarian lesions; ovarian tissue samples from all the subjects (benign and malignant) were subjected to methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction for methylated and unmethylated alleles of the genes (E-cadherin, p15, and p16). Results obtained showed that aberrant methylation of p15 and p16 genes were detected in 64.29 and 50% of ovarian cancer patients, while E-cadherin hypermethylation was detected in 78.57% of ovarian cancer patients. Methylation of E-cadherin was significantly correlated with different stage of disease (p < 0.05). It was found that the risk of E-cadherin hypermethylation was 1.347-fold, while risk of p15 hypermethylation was 1.543-fold and p16 was 1.2-fold among patients with ovarian cancer than that among patients with benign ovarian lesions. In conclusion, Dysfunction of the cell cycle and/or the cell-cell adhesion molecule plays a role in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and that the analysis of the methylation of p15 and E-cadherin genes can provide clinically important evidence on which to base the treatment.

1612232|t|Islet cell antibodies in normal French schoolchildren.
1612232|a|Islet-cell antibodies have been reported to be of predictive value for the future development of Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes in first degree relatives of diabetic patients with the risk increasing in these subjects with the islet-cell antibodies titre. However, very little is known about islet-cell antibodies in background populations. Sera (n = 8363) from schoolchildren (6-17 years) in the French background population were screened for the presence of islet-cell antibodies by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. Islet-cell antibodies greater than 4.5 Juvenile Diabetes Foundation units were found in 150 sera (prevalence rate 1.8%; 95% confidence interval 1.5-2.1%). Only 17 sera demonstrated islet-cell antibody titre greater than or equal to 24 JDF units. No particular feature was found to be significantly different between islet-cell antibody-positive and islet-cell antibody-negative children (age, family history of diabetes, fasting plasma glucose, insulin autoantibodies). A second blood sample was obtained from 80 of 150 islet-cell antibody positive children after a mean interval of 8 months. Only 11 sera became less than 4.5 JDF units with islet-cell antibody titres being stable in the remaining sera, including the high-titre positive sera (greater than or equal to 24 JDF units). HLA-DQB typing was performed by restriction mapping techniques in 80 islet-cell antibody-positive, in 93 islet-cell antibody-negative and in 213 Type 1 diabetic children. The distribution of the susceptibility alleles (DQB1-Asp57-negative) was not significantly different between islet-cell antibody-positive and islet-cell antibody-negative children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

23100158|t|Apoptosis initiation of b-ionone in SGC-7901 gastric carcinoma cancer cells via a PI3K-AKT pathway.
23100158|a|b-ionone has been shown to hold potent anti-proliferative and apoptosis induction properties in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the effects of b-ionone on apoptosis initiation and its possible mechanisms of action, we qualified cell apoptosis, proteins related to apoptosis and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway in human gastric adenocarcinoma cancer SGC-7901 cells. The results demonstrated that b-ionone-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in SGC-7901 cells treated with b-ionone (25, 50, 100 and 200 umol/L) for 24 h. b-ionone was also shown to induce the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 and inhibit bcl-2 expression in SGC-7901 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The significantly decreased levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT expression were observed in SGC-7901 cells after b-ionone treatments in a time- and dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01). Thus, the apoptosis induction in SGC-7901 cells by b-ionone may be regulated through a PI3K-AKT pathway. These results demonstrate a potential mechanism by which b-ionone to induce apoptosis initiation in SGC-7901 cells.

11392054|t|Vasoconstrictive drugs increase carbonic anhydrase I in vascular smooth muscle while vasodilating drugs reduce the activity of this isozyme by a direct mechanism of action.
11392054|a|Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is a zinc enzyme that catalyses the reversible hydration reaction of CO2 and plays a major role in the acid-base balance. We have previously shown that certain vasoconstrictive therapeutic agents increase CA I activity whereas vasodilating drugs reduce the activity of this isozyme by a direct mechanism of action. In this paper we studied the effect of other vasoconstrictive and vasodilating agents on CA I activity in order to elucidate the involvement of vascular smooth muscle CA I in vasoconstrictive and vasodilating processes. We studied the in vitro effects of noradrenaline, prostaglandin F2 alpha, thromboxane A2, leukotriene B4, angiotensin II, vasopressin, indomethacin, prazosin, hydralazine, clonidine, reserpine, prostaglandin I2, indapamide, furosemide, amlodipine, verapamil and irbesartan on purified human red blood cell CA I and vascular smooth muscle CA I isolated from rabbits. In vivo, we selected six groups of five rabbits each, which were administered the following substances in acute experiments: orciprenaline (group 1), desmopressin (group 2), verapamil (group 3), irbesartan (group 4), acetazolamide (group 5) and placebo (control group). Vascular smooth muscle CA I activity and systolic blood pressure were determined and compared with those of the control group. In vitro results showed that all the vasoconstrictive agents studied increased purified and human erythrocyte CA I activity as well as vascular smooth muscle CA I, while vasodilating substances reduced the activity of isozyme by a direct mechanism of action. The same results obtained in vivo showed that activation of vascular smooth muscle CA I increased blood pressure while its inhibition reduced blood pressure. The results of this study suggest that pHi changes, induced by activating or inhibiting CA I in vascular smooth muscle, might be responsible for changes in vascular tonus.

23391632|t|The increased number of Leydig cells by di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate comes from the differentiation of stem cells into Leydig cell lineage in the adult rat testis.
23391632|a|The objective of the present study is to determine whether di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure at adulthood increases rat Leydig cell number and to investigate the possible mechanism. 90-day-old Long-Evans rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, and were gavaged with the corn oil (control) or 10 or 750mg/kg DEHP daily for 7 days, and then received an intraperitoneal injection of 75mg/kg ethane dimethanesulfonate (EDS) to eliminate Leydig cells. Serum testosterone concentrations were assessed by RIA, and the mRNA levels of Leydig cell genes were measured by qPCR. EDS eliminated all Leydig cells in the control testis on day 4 post-EDS, as judged by undetectable serum testosterone level and no 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase positive (3b-HSD(pos)) cells in the interstitium. However, in DEHP-treated groups, there were detectable serum testosterone concentrations and some oval-shaped 3b-HSD(pos) cells in the interstitium. These 3b-HSD(pos) cells were not stained by the antibody against 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11b-HSD1), a marker for Leydig cells at a more advanced stage. The disappearance of mRNAs of Leydig cell biomarkers including Lhcgr, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Insl3 and Hsd11b1 in the control testis was observed on day 4 post-EDS. However, there were detectable concentrations of Lhcgr, Cyp11a1 and Cyp17a1 mRNAs but undetectable concentrations of Insl3, Hsd17b3 and Hsd11b1 in the DEHP-treated testes, indicating that these 3b-HSD(pos) cells were newly formed progenitor Leydig cells. The mRNA level for nestin (Nes, biomarker for stem Leydig cells) was significantly increased in the control testis on day 4 post-EDS, but not in the DEHP treated testes, suggesting that these nestin positive stem cells were differentiated into progenitor Leydig cells in the DEHP-treated testes. The present study suggests that DEHP increases the differentiation of stem cells into progenitor Leydig cells.

23207322|t|pH-responsive composite microspheres based on magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticle for drug delivery.
23207322|a|pH-responsive composite microspheres, consisting of a core of Fe3O4 nanoparticle, a sandwiched layer of mesoporous silica and a shell of crosslinked poly (methacrylic acid) (PMAA), were successfully synthesized via distillation precipitation polymerization. The pKa of the composite microsphere increased with the increase in the crosslinking density. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was applied as a model drug, and the behavior of drug storage/release was investigated. The cumulative release of DOX-loaded composite microsphere in vitro showed that the drug release rate was much faster below its pKa than that of above its pKa. Because pH of most tumor tissues was lower than that of normal tissues, the pH-responsive composite microspheres are promising drug delivery system especially for cancer therapy.

1666997|t|[Preclinical pharmacology of amoxapine and amitriptyline. Implications of serotoninergic and opiodergic systems in their central effect in rats].
1666997|a|The effects of two antidepressant drugs, amoxapine and amitriptyline, that belong to distinct chemical classes, have been examined on various biochemical parameters related to serotoninergic and opioidergic neurotransmission in the rat brain and spinal cord. In vitro binding studies showed that both amoxapine and amitriptyline interact in the nanomolar range with 5-HT2 receptors labelled by [3H]ketanserin in cortical membranes. By contrast, neither amoxapine nor amitriptyline can be considered as possible ligands of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors because their affinities for these sites are in the micromolar range (or even worse). Interestingly, amoxapine binds with a good affinity (IC50 = 0.30 microM) to 5-HT3 receptors labelled by [3H]zacopride in cortical membranes. Complementary experiments using the 5-HT3-dependent Bezold-Jarisch reflex confirmed that amoxapine really acts in vivo as a 5-HT3 antagonist (IC50 = 50 micrograms/kg i.v.), whereas amitriptyline is essentially inactive on 5-HT3 receptors. The second part of this study consisted of looking for possible changes in central 5-HT receptors 24 h after either a single or a repeated (for 14 days) treatment with amoxapine (10 mg/kg i.p. each day) or amitriptyline (10 mg/kg i.p.). A marked decrease in the density of 5-HT2 receptors was found in the cerebral cortex in both treatment groups. By contrast, neither 5-HT1A nor 5-HT1B receptors were significantly affected in any brain region studied. Finally we explored whether acute and/or chronic administration of amoxapine or amitriptyline affected the levels of opioid peptides and the mu and delta classes of opioid receptors in various regions of the brain and the spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

10727715|t|The role of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors on the modulation of acute fluoxetine-induced changes in extracellular 5-HT: the mechanism of action of (+/-)pindolol.
10727715|a|Some clinical evidence has suggested that (+/-)pindolol can be effective at producing a shortened time to onset of antidepressant activity when co-administered with a serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This effect has been attributed to the antagonist effects of pindolol at the 5-HT(1A) receptor. In the present study, we compared the pharmacology of (+/-)pindolol, WAY-100635 (a 5-HT(1A) antagonist), GR127935 (a 5-HT(1B/1D) antagonist), and isamoltane (a 5-HT(1B) antagonist), when given acutely in combination with fluoxetine, using in vivo microdialysis in the frontal cortex of the freely moving rat. We have determined that the acute fluoxetine-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT can be augmented by (+/-)pindolol, WAY100635, GR127935 and isamoltane with maximum increases of 216+/-32%, 235+/-49%, 240+/-18% and 171+/-47% of preinjection control levels, respectively. Combination of both 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B/1D) autoreceptor antagonists with fluoxetine produced additive increases in extracellular 5-HT (i.e. WAY100635+GR127935+fluoxetine and WAY100635+isamoltane+fluoxetine produced a four- and five-fold potentiation, respectively), suggesting that this strategy may be useful in further augmenting the action of a SSRI in the treatment of depression. In addition, by comparing the combined administration of (+/-)pindolol with either WAY100635, GR127935 or isamoltane, we have determined that (+/-)pindolol produces much of its acute potentiation of fluoxetine-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT via its action at the 5-HT(1B/D) receptor in addition to any activity it has at the presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor.

23440512|t|Vitamin A and retinoid signaling: genomic and non-genomic effects.
23440512|a|Vitamin A or retinol is arguably the most multifunctional vitamin in the human body as it is essential from embryogenesis to adulthood. The pleiotropic effects of vitamin A are exerted mainly by one active metabolite, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), which regulates the expression of a battery of target genes through several families of nuclear receptors (RARs, RXRs and PPARb/d), polymorphic retinoic acid (RA) response elements and multiple coregulators. It also involves extra nuclear and non-transcriptional effects such as the activation of kinase cascades, which are integrated in the nucleus via the phosphorylation of several actors of RA signaling. However, vitamin A itself proved recently to be active and RARs to be present in the cytosol to regulate translation and cell plasticity. All these new concepts expand the scope of the biologic functions of vitamin A and RA.

23411171|t|Anti-inflammatory effects of an aqueous extract of Welsh onion green leaves in mice.
23411171|a|The anti-inflammatory effects of an aqueous extract of Welsh onion green leaves (WOE) in mice was investigated. Administration of WOE, in the range of 0.25-1g/kg, showed a concentration dependent inhibition on paw edema development after carrageenan treatment in mice. The anti-inflammatory effects of WOE were closely attributed to decreased levels of tissue NO and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). Further evidence for WOE's protection is shown in the reduction of lipid oxidation and the increase of antioxidant enzyme activities, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in vivo. Further, WOE also decreased the number of acetic acid-induced writhing responses and formalin-induced pain in the late phase in mice. Overall, the results showed that WOE might serve as a natural source of anti-inflammatory compounds.

15635044|t|Extracellular loop 3 (EL3) and EL3-proximal transmembrane helix 7 of the mammalian type I and type II gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors determine differential ligand selectivity to GnRH-I and GnRH-II.
15635044|a|Mammalian type I and II gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors (GnRHRs) show differential ligand preference for GnRH-I and GnRH-II, respectively. Using a variety of chimeric receptors based on green monkey GnRHR-2 (gmGnRHR-2), a representative type II GnRHR, and rat GnRHR, a representative type I GnRHR, this study elucidated specific domains responsible for this ligand selectivity. A chimeric gmGnRHR-2 with the extracellular loop 3 (EL3) and EL3-proximal transmembrane helix 7 (TMH7) of rat GnRHR showed a great increase in ligand sensitivity to GnRH-I but not to GnRH-II. Point-mutation studies indicate that four amino acids, Leu/Phe(7.38), Leu/Phe(7.43), Ala/Pro(7.46), and Pro/Cys(7.47) in TMH7 are critical for ligand selectivity as well as receptor conformation. Furthermore, a combinatory mutation (Pro(7.31)-Pro(7.32)-Ser(7.33) motif to Ser-Glu-Pro in EL3 and Leu(7.38), Leu(7.43), Ala(7.46), and Pro(7.47) to those of rat GnRHR) in gmGnRH-2 exhibited an approximately 500-fold increased sensitivity to GnRH-I, indicating that these residues are critical for discriminating GnRH-II from GnRH-I. [Trp(7)]GnRH-I and [Trp(8)]GnRH-I but not [His(5)]GnRH-I exhibit a higher potency in activating wild-type gmGnRHR-2 than native GnRH-I, indicating that amino acids at positions 7 and 8 of GnRHs are more important than position 5 for differential recognition by type I and type II GnRHRs. As a whole, these data suggest a molecular coevolution of ligands and their receptors and facilitate the understanding of the molecular interaction between GnRHs and their cognate receptors.

15944809|t|Verapamil prevents torsade de pointes by reduction of transmural dispersion of repolarization and suppression of early afterdepolarizations in an intact heart model of LQT3.
15944809|a|BACKGROUND: In long QT syndrome (LQTS), prolongation of the QT-interval is associated with sudden cardiac death resulting from potentially life-threatening polymorphic tachycardia of the torsade de pointes (TdP) type. Experimental as well as clinical reports support the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers such as verapamil may be an appropriate therapeutic approach in LQTS. We investigated the electrophysiologic mechanism by which verapamil suppresses TdP, in a recently developed intact heart model of LQT3. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 8 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, veratridine (0.1 microM), an inhibitor of sodium channel inactivation, led to a marked increase in QT-interval and simultaneously recorded monophasic ventricular action potentials (MAPs) (p < 0.05) thereby mimicking LQT3. In bradycardic (AV-blocked) hearts, simultaneous recording of up to eight epi- and endocardial MAPs demonstrated a significant increase in total dispersion of repolarization (56%, p < 0.05) and reverse frequency-dependence. After lowering potassium concentration, veratridine reproducibly led to early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and TdP in 6 of 8 (75%) hearts. Additional infusion of verapamil (0.75 microM) suppressed EADs and consecutively TdP in all hearts. Verapamil significantly shortened endocardial but not epicardial MAPs which resulted in significant reduction of ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization. CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil is highly effective in preventing TdP via shortening of endocardial MAPs, reduction of left ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization and suppression of EADs in an intact heart model of LQT3. These data suggest a possible therapeutic role of verapamil in the treatment of LQT3 patients.

16741870|t|Thyroid hormone receptor expression in the obligatory paedomorphic salamander Necturus maculosus.
16741870|a|Amphibian metamorphosis is under the strict control of thyroid hormones (TH). These hormones induce metamorphosis by controlling gene expression through binding to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). Necturus maculosus is considered to be an obligatory paedomorphic Amphibian since metamorphosis never occurs spontaneously and cannot be induced by pharmacological means. Since metamorphosis depends on the acquisition of response of tadpole tissues to thyroid hormone, we aimed to determine TR gene expression patterns in Necturus maculosus as well as the expression of two TH-related genes: Cytosolic Thyroid Hormone-Binding Protein (CTHBP)-M2-pyruvate kinase, a gene encoding a cytosolic TH binding protein and stromelysin 3, a direct TH target gene in Xenopus laevis. Tissue samples were obtained from specimens of Necturus maculosus. We performed in situ hybridization using non-cross-hybridizing RNA probes obtained from the cloned Necturus TRalpha and TRbeta genes. We found clear expression of Necturus TRalpha gene in several tissues including the central nervous system, epithelial cells of digestive and urinary organs, as well as myocardium and skeletal muscle. TRbeta was also expressed in the brain. In other tissues, hybridization signals were too low to draw reliable conclusions about their precise distribution. In addition, we observed that the expression of CTHBP and ST3 is largely distinct from that of TRs. The fact that we observed a clear expression of TRalpha and TRbeta which are evolutionary conserved, suggests that Necturus tissues express TRs. Our results thus indicate that, in contrast to previously held hypotheses, Necturus tissues are TH responsive.

23125284|t|A mutation in the FAM36A gene, the human ortholog of COX20, impairs cytochrome c oxidase assembly and is associated with ataxia and muscle hypotonia.
23125284|a|The mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) is a multi-subunit enzyme that transfers electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen, yielding water. Its biogenesis requires concerted expression of mitochondria- and nuclear-encoded subunits and assembly factors. In this report, we describe a homozygous missense mutation in FAM36A from a patient who displays ataxia and muscle hypotonia. The FAM36A gene is a remote, putative ortholog of the fungal complex IV assembly factor COX20. Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein co-expression analyses support the involvement of FAM36A in complex IV function in mammals. The c.154A>C mutation in the FAM36A gene, a mutation that is absent in sequenced exomes, leads to a reduced activity and lower levels of complex IV and its protein subunits. The FAM36A protein is nearly absent in patient's fibroblasts. Cells affected by the mutation accumulate subassemblies of complex IV that contain COX1 but are almost devoid of COX2 protein. We observe co-purification of FAM36A and COX2 proteins, supporting that the FAM36A defect hampers the early step of complex IV assembly at the incorporation of the COX2 subunit. Lentiviral complementation of patient's fibroblasts with wild-type FAM36A increases the complex IV activity as well as the amount of holocomplex IV and of individual subunits. These results establish the function of the human gene FAM36A/COX20 in complex IV assembly and support a causal role of the gene in complex IV deficiency.

9231703|t|Cloning, characterization, and expression of a calcitonin receptor from guinea pig brain.
9231703|a|A calcitonin receptor was cloned from guinea pig brain by using a degenerate reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) strategy. When the cloned guinea pig calcitonin receptor was transfected into COS 1 cells, salmon calcitonin stimulated intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation with an EC50 of 0.1 nM, whereas human calcitonin was >250-fold less potent (EC50 27.6 nM). Related neuropeptides rat alphaCGRP and rat amylin did not activate the guinea pig calcitonin receptor at physiologic concentrations. Stimulation of the transfected guinea pig calcitonin receptor by salmon calcitonin also resulted in phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis with an EC50 of 2.5 nM. Expression of the calcitonin receptor was mapped by a combination of RT-PCR, northern analysis, and expression in Xenopus oocytes. The guinea pig calcitonin receptor was most highly expressed in diencephalon and a single subtype was detected.

10522750|t|Threshold concentrations of endothelin-1: the effects on contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine in isolated rat cerebral and mesenteric arteries.
10522750|a|This study compares the effects of threshold concentrations of endothelin-1 in isolated rat basilar arteries with those in mesenteric arterial branches and investigates the mechanisms of inhibitory and potentiating endothelin-1-effects. In basilar arteries, endothelin-1 reduces the contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), by the thromboxane A2 agonist U46619, and by vasopressin. The inhibitory effect of endothelin-1 on the contraction induced by 5-HT is abolished by deendothelialization, by the endothelin ET(B) receptor antagonist RES 701-1, by indomethacin, or by glibenclamide. In mesenteric arteries, endothelin-1 potentiates the contractile effects of 5-HT, U46619, and vasopressin. The potentiation of the contractile effect induced by 5-HT is only somewhat modified by deendothelialization, but abolished by the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists GR32191 and ridogrel. U46619 potentiates the 5-HT-effect in mesenteric arteries. Thus, though the contractile endothelin ET(A) receptors were not blocked, threshold concentrations of endothelin-1 inhibited contractile effects in the rat basilar artery via activation of endothelial ET(B) receptors. Prostaglandins and ATP-sensitive K+ channels are involved in this inhibitory action. In contrast, endothelin-1 potentiates contractile actions in mesenteric arteries via the release of endogeneous thromboxane A2 from non-endothelial cells. The study points out the completely different role of the endothelium in combined effects of endothelin-1 between cerebral and mesenteric arteries.

8242725|t|Dopamine D2-receptor imaging with 123I-iodobenzamide SPECT in migraine patients abusing ergotamine: does ergotamine cross the blood brain barrier?
8242725|a|Two migraine patients were studied by in vivo SPECT using the dopamine D2-receptor specific radioligand 123I-3-iodo-6-methoxybenzamide (123I-IBZM) during ergotamine abuse and after withdrawal. Results were compared with 15 healthy controls. Striatum/cerebellum and striatum/occipital cortex ratios of count rate density were calculated as a semiquantitative measurement for striatal dopamine D2-receptor binding potential. No differences were found in striatal uptake of 123I-IBZM between healthy controls and the patients when on or off ergotamine. Preliminary evidence suggests that ergotamine may not occupy striatal dopamine D2-receptors to a large extent and thus may not cross the blood brain barrier in large quantities.

17418819|t|Functional and molecular characterization of multiple K-Cl cotransporter isoforms in corneal epithelial cells.
17418819|a|The dependence of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) activity on potassium-chloride cotransporter (KCC) isoform expression was characterized in corneal epithelial cells (CEC). During exposure to a 50% hypotonic challenge, the RVD response was larger in SV40-immortalized human CEC (HCEC) than in SV40-immortalized rabbit CEC (RCEC). A KCC inhibitor-[(dihydroindenyl)oxy] alkanoic acid (DIOA)-blocked RVD more in HCEC than RCEC. Under isotonic conditions, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) produced KCC activation and transient cell shrinkage. Both of these changes were greater in HCEC than in RCEC. Immunoblot analysis of HCEC, RCEC, primary human CEC (pHCEC), and primary bovine CEC (BCEC) plasma membrane enriched fractions revealed KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4 isoform expression, whereas KCC2 was undetectable. During a hypotonic challenge, KCC1 membrane content increased more rapidly in HCEC than in RCEC. Such a challenge induced a larger increase and more transient p44/42MAPK activation in HCEC than RCEC. On the other hand, HCEC and RCEC p38MAPK phosphorylation reached peak activations at 2.5 and 15 min, respectively. Only in HCEC, pharmacological manipulation of KCC activity modified the hypotonicity-induced activation of p44/42MAPK, whereas p38MAPK phosphorylation was insensitive to such procedures in both cell lines. Larger increases in HCEC KCC1 membrane protein content correlated with their ability to undergo faster and more complete RVD. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of KCC increased p44/42MAPK phosphorylation in HCEC but not in RCEC, presumably a reflection of low KCC1 membrane expression in RCEC. These findings suggest that KCC1 plays a role in (i) maintaining isotonic steady-state cell volume homeostasis, (ii) recovery of isotonic cell volume after a hypotonic challenge through RVD, and (iii) regulating hypotonicity-induced activation of the p44/42MAPK signaling pathway required for cell proliferation.

21475861|t|Does aspirin acetylate multiple cellular proteins? (Review).
21475861|a|Aspirin is a salicylate drug that is extensively used for its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and anti-thrombotic effects. More recently, it has been shown to decrease the incidence of cancers of epithelial origin. In most cases, aspirin is relatively safe. However, it does cause a host of adverse effects and toxicities, including gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcerations, nephrotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions. Although the inhibition of cyclooxygenases by aspirin, which leads to its anti-inflammatory/analgesic properties, has been well studied, the mechanisms involved in its chemopreventive effects as well as some of its adverse effects are as yet ill-defined. Studies over the past decades suggest that, besides cyclooxygenases, aspirin acetylates other cellular proteins. These studies used radiolabeled 3H or 14C aspirin, the only approach used to date for the detection of proteins acetylated by aspirin. In a recent study using protein-specific anti-acetyl lysine antibodies and immunological methods, we demonstrated the ability of aspirin to acetylate the tumor suppressor protein p53. In this review, we present current research from the literature on the aspirin-induced acetylation of proteins. We also describe an immunological approach to detecting acetylated proteins in aspirin-treated cells, and demonstrate that multiple proteins are acetylated. Since post-translational modification of proteins, such as acetylation, may lead to the alteration of their function, it is possible that some of the hitherto unexplained beneficial or adverse effects of aspirin could occur as a result of these modifications. The identification of these novel acetylation targets of aspirin represents a new area for investigation.

15723099|a|In a previous study, we demonstrated that a dextromethorphan analog, dimemorfan, has neuroprotective effects. Dextromethorphan and dimemorfan are high-affinity ligands at sigma1 receptors. Dextromethorphan has moderate affinities for phencyclidine sites, while dimemorfan has very low affinities for such sites, suggesting that these sites are not essential for the anticonvulsant actions of dimemorfan. Kainate (KA) administration (10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) produced robust convulsions lasting 4-6 h in rats. Pre-treatment with dimemorfan (12 or 24 mg kg(-1)) reduced seizures in a dose-dependent manner. Dimemorfan pre-treatment also attenuated the KA-induced increases in c-fos/c-jun expression, activator protein (AP)-1 DNA-binding activity, and loss of cells in the CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus. These effects of dimemorfan were comparable to those of dextromethorphan. The anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or dimemorfan was significantly counteracted by a selective sigma1 receptor antagonist BD 1047, suggesting that the anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or dimemorfan is, at least in part, related to sigma1 receptor-activated modulation of AP-1 transcription factors. We asked whether dimemorfan produces the behavioral side effects seen with dextromethorphan or dextrorphan (a phencyclidine-like metabolite of dextromethorphan). Conditioned place preference and circling behaviors were significantly increased in mice treated with phencyclidine, dextrorphan or dextromethorphan, while mice treated with dimemorfan showed no behavioral side effects. Our results suggest that dimemorfan is equipotent to dextromethorphan in preventing KA-induced seizures, while it may lack behavioral effects, such as psychotomimetic reactions.

17643344|t|Combination chemotherapy with a substance P receptor antagonist (aprepitant) and melarsoprol in a mouse model of human African trypanosomiasis.
17643344|a|Drug therapy for late-stage (encephalitic) human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is currently very unsatisfactory with the most commonly used drug, melarsoprol, having a 5% overall mortality. There is evidence in a mouse model of HAT that Substance P (SP) receptor antagonism reduces the neuroinflammatory reaction to CNS trypanosome infection. In this study we investigated the effects of combination chemotherapy with melarsoprol and a humanised SP receptor antagonist aprepitant (EMEND) in this mouse model. The melarsoprol/aprepitant drug combination did not produce any clinical signs of illness in mice with CNS trypanosome infection. This lack of any additional or unexpected CNS toxicity in the mouse model of CNS HAT provides valuable safety data for the future possible use of this drug combination in patients with late-stage HAT.

23336337|t|Enhancing macrocyclic diterpenes as multidrug-resistance reversers: structure-activity studies on jolkinol D derivatives.
23336337|a|The phytochemical study of Euphorbia piscatoria yielded jolkinol D (1) in a large amount, whose derivatization gave rise to 12 ester derivatives (2-13) and hydrolysis to compound 14. The in vitro modulation of P-gp of compounds 1-14 was evaluated through a combination of transport and chemosensitivity assays, using the L5178 mouse T lymphoma cell line transfected with the human MDR1 gene. Apart from jolkinol D, all derivatives (2-14) showed potential as MDR reversal agents. In this small library of novel bioactive macrocyclic lathyrane diterpene derivatives, designed to evaluate structure-activity relationships essential in overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR), some correlations between MDR reversal and molecular weight, accessible solvent areas, and octanol/water partition coefficient were identified that can contribute to the development of new selective P-gp reversal agents.

23261590|t|Neoechinulin A suppresses amyloid-b oligomer-induced microglia activation and thereby protects PC-12 cells from inflammation-mediated toxicity.
23261590|a|A pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), aggregation and deposition of amyloid-b peptides, has been recognized as a potent activator of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction. Therefore, downregulation of microglial activation has a significant therapeutic demand. In this study, focus was given to evaluate the ability of neoechinulin A, an indole alkaloid isolated from marine-derived Microsporum sp., to attenuate microglial activation by oligomeric amyloid-b 1-42 (Ab42). Neoechinulin A treatment significantly inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in Ab42-activated BV-2 microglia cells. In addition, we found that neoechinulin A significantly suppressed the production of neurotoxic inflammatory mediator tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in activated BV-2 cells. Moreover, the treatment downregulated the protein and gene expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6. Further, activated microglia-mediated apoptosis of PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells was significantly repressed by neoechinulin A. The molecular mechanism studies suggested that neoechinulin A may block the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) molecule p38, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1) and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) p65 and p50 subunits. Regulation of these signalling pathways have most probably contributed to the anti-inflammatory activity of neoechinulin A. Collectively, these results suggest that with further studies neoechinulin A have a potential to be developed as a modulator of neuroinflammatory process in AD.

16371234|t|Involvement of COX-1 and up-regulated prostaglandin E synthases in phosphatidylserine liposome-induced prostaglandin E2 production by microglia.
16371234|a|After engulfment of apoptotic cells through phosphatidylserine (PS)-mediated recognition, microglia secrete prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a potent anti-inflammatory molecule in the central nervous system. Despite the clinical significance, the mechanism underlying PGE2 production by phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is poorly understood. In the present study, we used PS liposomes to elucidate the phagocytic pathway for PGE2 production in microglia, because PS liposomes mimic the effects of apoptotic cells on microglia/macrophages. The level of PGE2 in the culture medium of primary cultured rat microglia was significantly increased by PS liposomes treatment but not by phosphatidylcholine liposomes treatment. The specific ligand for class B scavenger receptor (SR-B), high density lipoprotein, significantly suppressed PS liposome-induced PGE2 production. PS liposomes were immediately phagocytosed by microglia and sorted to endosomes/lysosomes. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and membrane-bound prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) were induced by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not with PS liposomes. On the other hand, mPGES-2 and cytosolic PGES (cPGES) that are functionally coupled with COX-1 were upregulated after treatment with PS liposomes or LPS. Furthermore, PS liposome-induced PGE2 production was significantly suppressed by indomethacin, a preferential COX-1 inhibitor, but not by NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. PS liposomes induced activation of p44/p42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in SR-BI independent manner. These observations strongly suggest that the up-regulation of terminal PGESs that are preferentially coupled with COX-1, especially mPGES-2, plays the pivotal role in PS liposome-induced PGE2 production by microglia. Although SR-BI plays an essential role in PS liposome-induced PGE2 production, other PS-recognizing receptors, possibly PS-specific receptor, could also promote PGE2 production by transducing intracellular signals including p44/p42 ERK after PS liposomes treatment.

23322166|t|LPA1-induced cytoskeleton reorganization drives fibrosis through CTGF-dependent fibroblast proliferation.
23322166|a|There has been much recent interest in lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling through one of its receptors, LPA1, in fibrotic diseases, but the mechanisms by which LPA-LPA1 signaling promotes pathological fibrosis remain to be fully elucidated. Using a mouse peritoneal fibrosis model, we demonstrate central roles for LPA and LPA1 in fibroblast proliferation. Genetic deletion or pharmacological antagonism of LPA1 protected mice from peritoneal fibrosis, blunting the increases in peritoneal collagen by 65.4 and 52.9%, respectively, compared to control animals and demonstrated that peritoneal fibroblast proliferation was highly LPA1 dependent. Activation of LPA1 on mesothelial cells induced these cells to express connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), driving fibroblast proliferation in a paracrine fashion. Activation of mesothelial cell LPA1 induced CTGF expression by inducing cytoskeleton reorganization in these cells, causing nuclear translocation of myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-A and MRTF-B. Pharmacological inhibition of MRTF-induced transcription also diminished CTGF expression and fibrosis in the peritoneal fibrosis model, mitigating the increase in peritoneal collagen content by 57.9% compared to controls. LPA1-induced cytoskeleton reorganization therefore makes a previously unrecognized but critically important contribution to the profibrotic activities of LPA by driving MRTF-dependent CTGF expression, which, in turn, drives fibroblast proliferation.-Sakai, N., Chun, J., Duffield, J. S., Wada, T., Luster, A. D., Tager, A. M. LPA1-induced cytoskeleton reorganization drives fibrosis through CTGF-dependent fibroblast proliferation.

22902329|t|Vitamin E deficiency impairs the somatostatinergic receptor-effector system and leads to phosphotyrosine phosphatase overactivation and cell death in the rat hippocampus.
22902329|a|Vitamin E plays an essential role in maintaining the structure and function of the nervous system, and its deficiency, commonly associated with fat malabsorption diseases, may reduce neuronal survival. We previously demonstrated that the somatostatinergic system, implicated in neuronal survival control, can be modulated by a-tocopherol in the rat dentate gyrus, increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein phosphorylation. To gain a better understanding of the molecular actions of tocopherols and examine the link among vitamin E, somatostatin and neuronal survival, we have investigated the effects of a deficiency and subsequent administration of tocopherol on the somatostatin signaling pathway and neuronal survival in the rat hippocampus. No changes in somatostatin expression were detected in vitamin-E-deficient rats. These rats, however, showed a significant increase in the somatostatin receptor density and dissociation constant, which correlated with a significant increase in the protein levels of somatostatin receptors. Nevertheless, vitamin E deficiency impaired the ability of the somatostatin receptors to couple to the effectors adenylyl cyclase and phosphotyrosine phosphatase by diminishing Gi protein functionality. Furthermore, vitamin E deficiency significantly increased phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and PTPh expression, as well as PKCd activation, and decreased extracellular-signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. All these changes were accompanied by an increase in neuronal cell death. Subsequent a-tocopherol administration partially or completely reversed all these values to control levels. Altogether, our results prove the importance of vitamin E homeostasis in the somatostatin receptor-effector system and suggest a possible mechanism by which this vitamin may regulate the neuronal cell survival in the adult hippocampus.

17488480|t|Hydrogen sulfide acts as a mediator of inflammation in acute pancreatitis: in vitro studies using isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells.
17488480|a|Hydrogen sulphide (H(2)S) is synthesized from L-cysteine via the action of cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS). We have earlier shown that H(2)S acts as a mediator of inflammation. However the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the presence of H(2)S and the expression of H(2)S synthesizing enzymes, CSE and CBS, in isolated mouse pancreatic acini. Pancreatic acinar cells from mice were incubated with or without caerulein (10(-7) M for 30 and 60 min). Caerulein increased the levels of H(2)S and CSE mRNA expression while CBS mRNA expression was decreased. In addition, cells pre-treated with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, 3 mM), a CSE inhibitor, reduced the formation of H(2)S in caerulein treated cells, suggesting that CSE may be the main enzyme involved in H(2)S formation in mouse acinar cells. Furthermore, substance P (SP) concentration in the acini and expression of SP gene (preprotachykinin-A, PPT-A) and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), the primary receptor for SP, are increased in secretagogue caerulein-treated acinar cells. Inhibition of endogenous production of H(2)S by PAG significantly suppressed SP concentration, PPT-A expression and NK1-R expression in the acini. To determine whether H(2)S itself provoked inflammation in acinar cells, the cells were treated with H(2)S donor drug, sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), (10, 50 and 100 muM), that resulted in a significant increase in SP concentration and expression of PPT-A and NK1-R in acinar cells. These results suggest that the pro-inflammatory effect of H(2)S may be mediated by SP-NK-1R related pathway in mouse pancreatic acinar cells.

12063741|t|[Leflunomide--a new drug for pharmacological immunomodulation].
12063741|a|The novel immunomodulatory agent leflunomide exhibits a strong anti-inflammatory action. This isoxazole derivative is chemically unrelated to any hitherto applied immunosuppressants. As a prodrug leflunomide is completely converted to its active metabolite A 77 1726 (M1) which blocks the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme of the pyrimidine de novo synthesis. Drug-related adverse effects are mild, dose-related and reversible, characterising leflunomide as a safe immunosuppressant. While up to now leflunomide has just been approved for therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, its mechanism of action affects multiple inflammatory pathways, thereby suggesting it to be a potent therapeutic agent in autoimmune diseases, graft rejection, and tumour therapy. First dermatological experience has been gained in psoriasis and bullous pemphigoid. The role of leflunomide in the dermatologist's therapeutic armamentarium will evolve during the next years.

23253172|t|Neurochemical control of rapid stress-induced changes in brain aromatase activity.
23253172|a|In the male brain, the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) is known to be a critical relay for the activation of sexual behaviour, with the aromatisation of testosterone into 17b-oestradiol (E2 ) playing a key role. Acute stress has been shown to differentially modulate the aromatase enzyme in this and other brain nuclei in a sex-specific manner. In POM specifically, stress induces increases in aromatase activity (AA) that are both rapid and reversible. How the physiological processes initiated during an acute stress response mediate sex- and nuclei- specific changes in AA and which stress response hormones are involved remains to be determined. By examining the relative effects of corticosterone (CORT), arginine vasotocin (AVT, the avian homologue to arginine vasopressin) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), the present study aimed to define the hormone profile regulating stress-induced increases in AA in the POM. We found that CORT, AVT and CRF all appear to play some role in these changes in the male brain. In addition, these effects occur in a targeted manner, such that modulation of the enzyme by these hormones only occurs in the POM rather than in all aromatase-expressing nuclei. Similarly, in the female brain, the experimental effects were restricted to the POM but only CRF was capable of inducing the stress-like increases in AA. These data further demonstrate the high degree of specificity (nuclei-, sex- and hormone-specific effects) in this system, highlighting the complexity of the stress-aromatase link and suggesting modes through which the nongenomic modulation of this enzyme can result in targeted, rapid changes in local oestrogen concentrations.

23425605|t|The role of de novo catecholamine synthesis in mediating methylmercury-induced vesicular dopamine release from rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells.
23425605|a|The purpose of this study was to characterize methylmercury (MeHg)-induced dopamine (DA) release from undifferentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and to examine the potential role for DA synthesis in this process. MeHg caused a significant increase in DA release that was both concentration- and time-dependent. DA release was significantly increased by 2uM MeHg at 60min and by 5uM MeHg at 30min; 1uM MeHg was without effect. Because DA release induced by 5uM MeHg was associated with a significant percentage of cell death at 60 and 120min, 2uM MeHg was chosen for further characterization of release mechanisms. MeHg-induced DA release was attenuated but not abolished in the absence of extracellular calcium, whereas the vesicular content depleting drug reserpine (50nM) abolished release. Thus, MeHg-induced DA release requires vesicular exocytosis but not extracellular calcium. MeHg also increased intracellular DA and the rate of DA storage utilization, suggesting a role for DA synthesis in MeHg-induced DA release. The tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor a-methyltyrosine (300uM, 24h) completely abolished MeHg-induced DA release. MeHg significantly increased DA precursor accumulation in cells treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (10uM), revealing that MeHg increases tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Overall, these data demonstrate that MeHg facilitates DA synthesis, increases intracellular DA, and augments vesicular exocytosis.

10942908|t|Interactive and delayed effects of pyridostigmine and physical stress on biochemical and histological changes in peripheral tissues of mice.
10942908|a|Gulf War veterans were taking pyridostigmine orally against possible exposure to nerve agents as well as being under physical stress. This study was designed to investigate the delayed effects of pyridostigmine and treadmill exercise on cholinesterase activity, lipid peroxidation and histology of peripheral tissues of mice. Male NIH Swiss mice were divided into four groups of 15 animals each and treated as follows: sedentary control; exercise training for 10 weeks; pyridostigmine (1.2 mg kg(-1), p.o.) for 2 weeks during weeks 5 and 6; and pyridostigmine plus exercise training. The mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last exercise, and blood, triceps muscle and sciatic nerve were isolated and analyzed. The group treated with pyridostigmine alone showed decreased plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity (87% of control), whereas pyridostigmine plus exercise significantly decreased the BChE activity (79% of control), indicating an interactive effect of the combination. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity did not alter significantly in red blood cells, platelets or sciatic nerve with either of the treatments. However, AChE activity in triceps muscle decreased significantly (78% of control) in the group treated with pyridostigmine plus exercise. Creatine phosphokinase activity in plasma increased slightly (compared to control, pyridostigmine or exercise group) in mice treated with pyridostigmine plus exercise, which may be indicative of perturbation in the integrity of the skeletal muscle due to combination. However, there were no obvious histological abnormalities in the triceps muscle detected between experimental and control groups. Interaction of pyridostigmine and exercise significantly increased the concentration of the end product of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) (124% of control) in triceps muscle, indicating an oxidative stress response of the combination. These results indicate that physical stress enhanced the delayed toxic effects of a subchronic oral dose of pyridostigmine primarily in the skeletal muscle of mice.

6227474|t|Characterization of rat brain aldosterone receptors reveals high affinity for corticosterone.
6227474|a|The two [3H]aldosterone-binding proteins of rat brain cytosol were characterized by a dextran-coated charcoal method. With molybdate present to stabilize receptors, the affinities of the two sites for [3H]aldosterone in adrenalectomized perfused rat brain cytosols were 0.28 and 18.0 nM at 4 C. High affinity sites comprised 15% of the total receptor number. A small contamination of perfused brain cytosol preparations with corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) was found. However, due to the very high affinity of CBG for corticosterone at 4 C, this slight contamination resulted in significant alterations in the apparent affinity of steroids competing for aldosterone-binding sites. Selective precipitation of cytosol receptors with 36% (NH4)2SO4 reduced CBG concentrations to negligible levels. After blockade of low affinity sites with a highly selective glucocorticoid (RU 26988), the order of steroids in competing for the high affinity receptor was desoxycorticosterone greater than fludrocortisone greater than corticosterone greater than aldosterone greater than progesterone greater than dexamethasone. Readdition of a small quantity of dialyzed serum to cytosol preparations yielded a profile of steroid binding similar to that of the kidney mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone greater than desoxycorticosterone greater than corticosterone). The distribution of both receptors in brain regions of adrenalectomized rats was determined. Both receptors were at greatest density in the hippocampus and lowest density in the hypothalamus. The high affinity site was at greatest density in limbic regions, whereas the low affinity receptor, apparently identical to the glucocorticoid type II receptor, was at greatest density in cortex and cerebellum. It is concluded that the high affinity aldosterone receptor of rat brain, which had been identified in preliminary studies as a mineralocorticoid receptor, may bind either corticosterone or aldosterone in vivo.

23429911|a|The dopamine D3 receptor (DRD3) in the ventral striatum is thought to influence motivation and motor functions. Although the expression of DRD3 in the ventral striatum has been shown to exhibit 24-hour variations, the mechanisms underlying the variation remain obscure. Here, we demonstrated that molecular components of the circadian clock act as regulators that control the 24-hour variation in the expression of DRD3. The transcription of DRD3 was enhanced by the retinoic acid-related orphan receptor a (RORa), and its activation was inhibited by the orphan receptor REV-ERBa, an endogenous antagonist of RORa. The serum or dexamethasone-induced oscillation in the expression of DRD3 in cells was abrogated by the downregulation or overexpression of REV-ERBa, suggesting that REV-ERBa functions as a regulator of DRD3 oscillations in the cellular autonomous clock. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the DRD3 promoter indicated that the binding of the REV-ERBa protein to the DRD3 promoter increased in the early dark phase. DRD3 protein expression varied with higher levels during the dark phase. Moreover, the effects of the DRD3 agonist 7-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT)-induced locomotor hypoactivity were significantly increased when DRD3 proteins were abundant. These results suggest that RORa and REV-ERBa consist of a reciprocating mechanism wherein RORa upregulates the expression of DRD3, whereas REV-ERBa periodically suppresses the expression at the time of day when REV-ERBa is abundant. Our present findings revealed that a molecular link between the circadian clock and the function of DRD3 in the ventral striatum acts as a modulator of the pharmacological actions of DRD3 agonists/antagonists.

12487427|t|Investigation of bradykinin metabolism in human and rat plasma in the presence of the dual ACE/NEP inhibitors GW660511X and omapatrilat.
12487427|a|Several studies have suggested that the accumulation of bradykinin, or that of one its metabolites BK1-8, is involved in the occurrence of side effects such as AE associated with the use of various ACEi. In this work a novel approach combining HPLC-UV on-line with oaTOF-MS and ICPMS was applied to investigate in human and rat plasma the metabolism of labelled BK (79/81 Br-Phe5) BrBK in the presence of two new dual ACE/NEP inhibitors (GW660511X and omapatrilat) currently under clinical trial. In human plasma the BrBK half-life values in the absence or in the presence of GW660511X (3.8 microM) or omapatrilat (32 nM) were 38.7 +/- 2.4, 51.2 +/- 4.7 and 114.7 +/- 9.3 min, respectively and BrBK was degraded into BrBK1-8, BrBK1-7, BrBK1-5 and Br-Phe. In the presence of inhibitors, however, the levels of these resultant metabolites were different. Unlike GW660511X, omapatrilat abolished the production of BrBK1-5 and BrBK1-7, suggesting a better ACE inhibition effect over GW660511X as no NEP activity was found. In addition the production of BrBK1-8 was enhanced in the presence of these inhibitors with a greater accumulation being observed with omapatrilat. The production of Br-Phe5 was reduced with GW660511X while no significant change was observed with omapatrilat after 4 h of incubation. In rat plasma the BrBK half-life values in the absence or in the presence of GW660511X (530 nM) or omapatrilat (50 nM) were 9.31 +/- 1.7, 22.06 +/- 3.1 and 25.3 +/- 1.7 min, respectively and BrBK was degraded into BrBK1-8, BrBK1-7, BrBK1-5 and Br-Phe5 plus BrBK2-9, BrBK4-8 and BrBK2-8 metabolites not found in human plasma. GW660511X and omapatrilat reduced the production of BrBK1-5 and BrBK1-7 with more effect being observed with omapatrilat. GW660511X and omapatrilat increased the production of both BrBK1-8 and Br-Phe5 but not that of BrBK4-8 and BrBK2-8. This study shows that the potency of GW660511X in comparison with omapatrilat is more than 100-fold lower in human, but less than 10-fold lower in rat plasma, suggesting that rat may not be a suitable in vivo model for the evaluation of ACE/NEP inhibition in relation to effects in humans.

16633143|t|Reboxetine versus fluvoxamine in the treatment of motor vehicle accident-related posttraumatic stress disorder: a double-blind, fixed-dosage, controlled trial.
16633143|a|BACKGROUND: Motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) are a leading cause of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the general population. Alterations in norepinephrine and serotonin systems have been proposed as mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of the condition, with treatment directed at these neurotransmitter systems. Reboxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, exhibits high affinity and selectivity for the human norepinephrine transporter. Inasmuch as PTSD may be associated with dysregulation of noradrenergic activity, the present double-blind randomized clinical trial intended to evaluate reboxetine's efficacy in the management of MVA-related PTSD and to compare its efficacy with a medication commonly used in PTSD, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine. METHODS: Forty patients with MVA-related PTSD attending a local community mental health outpatient clinic were randomized to receive a fixed dose of either reboxetine (8 mg/d) or fluvoxamine (150 mg/d) in a double-blind fashion for a period of 8 weeks. RESULTS: At baseline and at study end point, the 2 subgroups demonstrated no statistical differences in scores on PTSD, depression, and anxiety rating scales. Both medications led to significant improvements in all clinical scales measured. Nine patients receiving reboxetine and 3 receiving fluvoxamine withdrew from the study because of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Study observations indicate comparable efficacy of reboxetine and fluvoxamine in the management of MVA-related PTSD despite reboxetine's selective noradrenergic activity. Reboxetine appears to be at least as effective as fluvoxamine and may offer an alternative management option in this often difficult-to-treat and disabling condition. A lower and flexible reboxetine dosing schedule will be recommended for future research to improve its tolerability in PTSD patients.

10701840|t|The Hsp90-specific inhibitor geldanamycin selectively disrupts kinase-mediated signaling events of T-lymphocyte activation.
10701840|a|The 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is the most abundant molecular chaperone of eukaryotic cells. Its chaperone function in folding nascent proteins seems to be restricted to a subset of proteins including major components of signal transduction pathways (eg, nuclear hormone receptors, transcription factors, and protein kinases). Improper function of these proteins can be induced by selective disruption of their complexes with Hsp90 using the benzoquinonoid ansamycin geldanamycin. In this study, we demonstrate that geldanamycin treatment blocks interleukin (IL)-2 secretion, IL-2 receptor expression, and proliferation of stimulated T-lymphocytes. Moreover, geldanamycin decreases the amount and phosphorylation of Lck and Raf-1 kinases and prevents activation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)-2 kinase. Geldanamycin also disrupts the T-cell receptor-mediated activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT). Treatment with geldanamycin, however, does not affect the activation of lysophosphatide acyltransferase, which is a plasma membrane enzyme coupled to the T-cell receptor after T-cell stimulation. Through demonstrating the selective inhibition of kinase-related T-lymphocyte responses by geldanamycin, our results emphasize the substantial role of Hsp90-kinase complexes in T-cell activation.

23471969|t|An Intracellular Domain Fragment of the p75 Neurotrophin Receptor (p75NTR) Enhances Tropomyosin Receptor Kinase A (TrkA) Receptor Function.
23471969|a|Facilitation of nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling by the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) is critical for neuronal survival and differentiation. However, the interaction between p75(NTR) and TrkA receptors required for this activity is not understood. Here, we report that a specific 29-amino acid peptide derived from the intracellular domain fragment of p75(NTR) interacts with and potentiates binding of NGF to TrkA-expressing cells, leading to increased neurite outgrowth in sympathetic neurons as a result of enhanced Erk1/2 and Akt signaling. An endogenous intracellular domain fragment of p75(NTR) (p75(ICD)) containing these 29 amino acids is produced by regulated proteolysis of the full-length receptor. We demonstrate that generation of this fragment is a requirement for p75(NTR) to facilitate TrkA signaling in neurons and propose that the juxtamembrane region of p75(ICD) acts to cause a conformational change within the extracellular domain of TrkA. This finding provides new insight into the mechanism by which p75(NTR) and TrkA interact to enhance neurotrophic signaling.

23228697|t|Carboxylesterase-2 is a highly sensitive target of the antiobesity agent orlistat with profound implications in the activation of anticancer prodrugs.
23228697|a|Orlistat has been the most used anti-obesity drug and the mechanism of its action is to reduce lipid absorption by inhibiting gastrointestinal lipases. These enzymes, like carboxylesterases (CESs), structurally belong to the a/b hydrolase fold superfamily. Lipases and CESs are functionally related as well. Some CESs (e.g., human CES1) have been shown to hydrolyze lipids. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that orlistat inhibits CESs with higher potency toward CES1 than CES2, a carboxylesterase with little lipase activity. Liver microsomes and recombinant CESs were tested for the inhibition of the hydrolysis of standard substrates and the anticancer prodrugs pentyl carbamate of p-aminobenzyl carbamate of doxazolidine (PPD) and irinotecan. Contrary to the hypothesis, orlistat at 1 nM inhibited CES2 activity by 75% but no inhibition on CES1, placing CES2 one of the most sensitive targets of orlistat. The inhibition varied among some CES2 polymorphic variants. Pretreatment with orlistat reduced the cell killing activity of PPD. Certain mouse but not rat CESs were also highly sensitive. CES2 is responsible for the hydrolysis of many common drugs and abundantly expressed in the gastrointestinal track and liver. Inhibition of this carboxylesterase probably presents a major source for altered therapeutic activity of these medicines if co-administered with orlistat. In addition, orlistat has been linked to various types of organ toxicities, and this study provides an alternative target potentially involved in these toxicological responses.

23493568|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) patients often exhibit hyperglucagonemia despite hyperglycemia suggesting defective a-cell function. While endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been suggested to underlie b-cell dysfunction in T2D, its role in a-cell biology remains unclear. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and its deficiency in b-cells has been reported to impair insulin secretion leading to glucose intolerance. To evaluate the role of XBP1 in a-cells, we created complementary in vivo (a-cell specific XBP1 knockout (aXBPKO) mice) and in vitro (stable XBP1 knock down a-cell line, aXBPKD) models. aXBPKO mice exhibited glucose intolerance, mild insulin resistance and an inability to suppress glucagon secretion following glucose stimulation. aXBPKD cells exhibited activation of IRE1, an upstream activator of XBP1, leading to phosphorylation of JNK. Interestingly, insulin treatment of aXBPKD cells reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (pY(896)), and phosphorylation of Akt, while enhancing serine phosphorylation (pS(307)) of IRS-1. Consequently the aXBPKD cells exhibited blunted suppression of glucagon secretion following insulin treatment in the presence of high glucose. Together, these data indicate that XBP1 deficiency in pancreatic a-cells induces altered insulin signaling and dysfunctional glucagon secretion.

23414838|t|Discovery of a novel series of quinolone a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists.
23414838|a|High throughput screening led to the identification of a novel series of quinolone a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists. Optimization of an HTS hit (1) led to 4-phenyl-1-(quinuclidin-3-ylmethyl)quinolin-2(1H)-one, which was found to be potent and selective. Poor brain penetrance in this series was attributed to transporter-mediated efflux, which was in turn due to high pKa. A novel 4-fluoroquinuclidine significantly lowered the pKa of the quinuclidine moiety, reducing efflux as measured by a Caco-2 assay.

16248990|t|Nicotinic-receptor potentiator drugs, huprine X and galantamine, increase ACh release by blocking AChE activity but not acting on nicotinic receptors.
16248990|a|The main goal of the present study was to analyse the effects of (+/-)-huprine X ((+/-)-HX) and galantamine (GAL), with potentiating action on nicotinic receptors, and huperzine A (HPA), devoid of nicotinic activity, on [3H]-acetylcholine ([3H]-ACh) release in striatal slices of rat brain. All compounds are non-covalent and reversible inhibitors of AChE. Addition of (+/-)-HX (0.01 microM), GAL (10 microM) and HPA (0.1 microM) to the superfusion medium decreased the release of the ACh neurotransmitter to a similar extent: 36%, 30% and 34%, respectively (P<0.01). This effect was reverted in the presence of atropine (ATR; 0.1 microM), which blocks the pre-synaptic muscarinic M2 receptor. After that, a wide range of concentrations of drugs, concomitantly with ATR (0.1 microM), was studied in the presence of haloperidol (HAL; 0.01 microM), a dopamine D2 antagonist. In these conditions, a dose-dependent increase of [3H]-ACh release was observed in the presence of (+/-)-HX, GAL and HPA. To test the role of nicotinic receptors in the drugs' effects on [3H]-ACh release, mecamylamine (MEC) 100 microM was used to block such receptors. MEC alone significantly decreased neurotransmitter release by 18% (P<0.05), but no change was obtained in the presence of both ATR and MEC. Under these conditions, (+/-)-HX, GAL and HPA increased the release of [3H]-ACh by 37%, 25% and 38%, respectively (P<0.01). Taking into account all of these data, the present results suggest that the effects induced by (+/-)-HX and GAL nicotinic-receptor potentiators seem to be mainly due to their ability in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity, but not by interaction on the nicotinic receptors.

15184278|t|Clinical assessment of norepinephrine transporter blockade through biochemical and pharmacological profiles.
15184278|a|BACKGROUND: To assess the sensitivity of biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological markers of peripheral norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) function, we chronically antagonized NET by a range of doses of duloxetine [(+)-N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2 thiophenepropanamine], which blocks the NE reuptake process. METHODS AND RESULTS: Duloxetine was administered in a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 15 healthy volunteers. Plasma from duloxetine-treated subjects (ex vivo effect) dose-dependently decreased radioligand binding to human NET (maximum inhibition was 60%) (P=0.02). The dose of intravenous tyramine required to raise systolic blood pressure by 30 mm Hg (PD30) increased dose-dependently with duloxetine and was significant at the end of the 120-mg/d dosage (P<0.001). The plasma dihydoxyphenylglycol to NE (DHPG/NE) ratio was reduced significantly at 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d duloxetine (11.3 at baseline, 3.4 at 240 mg/d, P<0.001). Plasma NE was significantly increased starting at 120 mg/d duloxetine. Urine results (corrected for 24-hour creatinine excretion) showed a dose-dependent change from the baseline urinary excretion for NE, DHPG, and the DHPG/NE ratio. The most sensitive measure, the DHPG/NE ratio, was significant at the 80-mg dose. Urinary NE excretion was significantly raised after 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d duloxetine (P<0.001), the lowest dose used in the study. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the degree of NET blockade can be assessed with the plasma or urine DHPG/NE ratio and the pressor effect of tyramine. Also, the DHPG/NE ratio is more sensitive at the lower end of NET inhibition, whereas tyramine exhibits a linear relation, with NET inhibition commencing at a higher dose.

15452358|t|Brain but not spinal NR2B receptor is responsible for the anti-allodynic effect of an NR2B subunit-selective antagonist CP-101,606 in a rat chronic constriction injury model.
15452358|a|In order to examine the site of action of an NR2B subtype-selective NMDA antagonist CP-101,606, we investigated its analgesic effect in a rat model of neuropathic pain at various routes of administration. Mechanical allodynia was induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Subcutaneous treatment of the animals with CP-101,606 at 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited CCI-induced mechanical allodynia. Intracerebroventricular injection of CP-101,606 at 10, 30 and 100 nmol also inhibited the mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner, the statistically significant effect being achieved at the highest dose tested (100 nmol) without producing any behavioral abnormalities. However, intrathecal injection of CP-101,606 at a dose of 300 nmol failed to inhibit CCI-induced allodynia. A receptor binding assay using rat forebrain and spinal cord membrane preparations demonstrated that [3H]CP-101,606 bound to the brain NR2B receptor with a greater extent compared to the spinal cord one. These findings suggest that the anti-allodynia effect of CP-101,606 is ascribable to blockade of NR2B receptors at the brain, but not at the spinal cord. In contrast, intrathecal injection of a non-selective NMDA antagonist, memantine, significantly inhibited CCI-induced mechanical allodynia at a dose of 300 nmol, indicating the difference in the site of action between the non-selective NMDA antagonist and the NR2B-specific NMDA antagonist.

16971132|t|Synthesis, dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, antitumor testing, and molecular modeling study of some new 4(3H)-quinazolinone analogs.
16971132|a|In order to produce potent new leads for anticancer drugs, a new series of quinazoline analogs was designed to resemble methotrexate (MTX, 1) structure features and fitted with functional groups believed to enhance inhibition of mammalian DHFR activity. Molecular modeling studies were used to assess the fit of these compounds within the active site of human DHFR. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit mammalian DHFR in vitro and for their antitumor activity in a standard in vitro tissue culture assay panel. Compounds 28, 30, and 31 were the most active DHFR inhibitors with IC(50) values of 0.5, 0.4, and 0.4microM, respectively. The most active antitumor agents in this study were compounds 19, 31, 41, and 47 with median growth inhibitory concentrations (GI(50)) of 20.1, 23.5, 26.7, and 9.1microM, respectively. Of this series of compounds, only compound 31 combined antitumor potency with potent DHFR inhibition; the other active antitumor compounds (19, 41, and 47) all had DHFR IC(50) values above 15microM, suggesting that they might exert their antitumor potency through some other mode of action. Alternatively, the compounds could differ significantly in uptake or concentration within mammalian cells.

8894610|t|(+/-)-tamsulosin, an alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibits the positive inotropic effect but not the accumulation of inositol phosphates in rabbit heart.
8894610|a|The influence of (+/-)-tamsulosin, a selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist, on the positive inotropic effect and the accumulation of inositol phosphates that are induced via alpha 1-adrenoceptors was studied in comparison with that of another alpha 1A-adrenoceptor ligand oxymetazoline in the rabbit ventricular myocardium. Phenylephrine elicited a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect via alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the presence of either (+/-)-bupranolol or S(-)-timolol. The mode of antagonism induced by (+/-)-tamsulosin on the effect of phenylephrine was dependent or the concentration applied: (+/-)-tamsulosin at 1 and 3 nM acted in a competitive manner, the slope of the regression line of the Schild plot being unity and the pA2 value being 9.12; at 10 nM, it shifted further the concentration-response curve to the right without affecting the maximal response but the slope became less than unity. At 100 nM and higher, it suppressed the maximal response to phenylephrine. (+/-)-Tamsulosin effectively antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine even after inactivation of alpha 1B-adrenoceptors by treatment with chlorethylclonidine, which is an indication that the (+/-)-tamsulosin-sensitive subtype belongs to a class resistant to chlorethylclonidine. (+/-)-Tamsulosin, over the range of concentrations at which it antagonized the positive inotropic effect mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors, did not affect the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates that was induced by 10 microM phenylephrine. Oxymetazoline antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine in a competitive manner without affecting the accumulation of inositol monophosphate induced by phenylephrine. These results indicate that the positive inotropic effect, mediated via (+/-)-tamsulosin- and oxymetazoline-sensitive subtype of alpha 1-adrenoceptors, is exerted by a subcellular mechanism that is independent of the accumulation of inositol phosphates.

23344974|t|Using a fragment-based approach to target protein-protein interactions.
23344974|a|The ability to identify inhibitors of protein-protein interactions represents a major challenge in modern drug discovery and in the development of tools for chemical biology. In recent years, fragment-based approaches have emerged as a new methodology in drug discovery; however, few examples of small molecules that are active against chemotherapeutic targets have been published. Herein, we describe the fragment-based approach of targeting the interaction between the tumour suppressor BRCA2 and the recombination enzyme RAD51; it makes use of a screening pipeline of biophysical techniques that we expect to be more generally applicable to similar targets. Disruption of this interaction in vivo is hypothesised to give rise to cellular hypersensitivity to radiation and genotoxic drugs. We have used protein engineering to create a monomeric form of RAD51 by humanising a thermostable archaeal orthologue, RadA, and used this protein for fragment screening. The initial fragment hits were thoroughly validated biophysically by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR techniques and observed by X-ray crystallography to bind in a shallow surface pocket that is occupied in the native complex by the side chain of a phenylalanine from the conserved FxxA interaction motif found in BRCA2. This represents the first report of fragments or any small molecule binding at this protein-protein interaction site.

It has a domain organization consisting of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 where the B domain is a heavily glycosylated region that is dispensable for procoagulant activity. Factor VIII expression is 10-to 20-fold lower than the homologous coagulation factor V. Factor VIII expression is limited due to a low level of steady-state messenger RNA in the cytoplasm and inefficient transport of the primary translation product from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Within the secretory pathway, factor VIII is processed to a heterodimer of the heavy chain (domains A1-A2-B) in a metal ion association with the light chain (domains A3-C1-C2). Upon secretion from the cell, von Willebrand factor binds the light chain of factor VIII and stabilizes the factor, preventing degradation. Protein folding within the mammalian secretory pathway is facilitated by molecular chaperones. Within the endoplasmic reticulum, factor VIII exhibits stable interaction with protein chaperones identified as the immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), calnexin and calreticulin. BiP is a peptide-dependent ATPase that interacts with exposed hydrophobic surfaces on unfolded proteins or unassembled protein subunits. A potential BiP binding site within factor VIII has been identified. Mutation of a single amino acid residue in the potential BiP binding site increased the secretion efficiency of factor VIII by threefold. Interestingly, the proposed BiP binding site is adjacent to a type-1 copper binding site within the A1 domain that is required for interaction between the factor VIII A1 domain and the A3 domain. We propose that Cu(I) binds the type-1 copper ion-binding site in the A1 domain and provides the essential requirement for a stable interaction between the heavy and light chains. Calnexin and calreticulin are transmembrane and lumenal proteins, respectively, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, which associate transiently with many soluble and membrane glycoproteins during folding and subunit assembly. The calnexin and calreticulin interaction with factor VIII occurs primarily through amino-terminal linked oligosaccharides within the heavily glycosylated factor VIII B domain and this interaction appears to be required for factor VIII secretion. The findings suggest that factor VIII cycles through interactions with BiP, calnexin and calreticulin. Although the interaction with BiP does not appear to be required for factor VIII secretion, data suggest that the calnexin and/or calreticulin interaction is required for secretion. The observations suggest a unique requirement for carbohydrate processing and calnexin/calreticulin interaction that may limit the productive secretion of factor VIII and have implications for approaches towards somatic cell gene therapy for hemophilia A.

11730729|t|Effect of fenoterol-induced constitutive beta(2)-adrenoceptor activity on contractile receptor function in airway smooth muscle.
11730729|a|In the present study, we investigated the effect of fenoterol-induced constitutive beta(2)-adrenoceptor activity on muscarinic receptor agonist- and histamine-induced bovine tracheal smooth muscle contractions. Bovine tracheal smooth muscle strips were incubated with 10 microM fenoterol or vehicle for various periods of time (5, 30 min, 18 h) at 37 degrees C. After extensive washout (3 h, 37 degrees C), isometric contractions were measured to the full muscarinic receptor agonist methacholine, the partial muscarinic receptor agonist 4-(m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium (McN-A-343) and histamine. Fenoterol treatment significantly reduced the sensitivity (pEC(50)) to methacholine in a time-dependent manner, without affecting maximal contraction (E(max)). Fenoterol treatment similarly reduced the pEC(50) of McN-A-343 and histamine; however, E(max) values were also reduced, to approximately 70% of control after 18-h treatment. The inverse agonist timolol, having no effect on control preparations, consistently restored the reduced pEC(50) and E(max) values of the contractile agonists. Remarkably, in the presence of timolol the pEC(50) values of McN-A-343 and histamine in fenoterol-treated airways were significantly enhanced compared to controls. In conclusion, fenoterol-induced constitutive beta(2)-adrenoceptor activity reduces muscarinic receptor agonist- and histamine-induced contractions of bovine tracheal smooth muscle, which can be reversed by the inverse agonist timolol. Moreover, after beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist treatment, inverse agonism by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may cause enhanced airway reactivity to contractile mediators.

23194548|t|Purification, physicochemical characterisation and anticancer activity of a polysaccharide from Cyclocarya paliurus leaves.
23194548|a|A Cyclocarya paliurus (Batal.) Iljinskaja polysaccharide (CPP) was isolated and purified by hot water extraction, ethanol precipitation, deproteinisation and anion-exchange chromatography. Its physicochemical properties were characterised by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), UV-visible spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and viscometry analysis. The anticancer effect of CPP in human gastric cancer HeLa cells was also evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The results showed that the molecular weight of CPP was 900 kDa, and it contained 64.8% total sugar, 23.5% uronic acid, 9.26% protein, and six kinds of monosaccharides, including glucose, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose and galactose, with molar percentages of 32.7%, 9.33%, 30.6%, 3.48%, 10.4%, and 13.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the results showed that CPP exhibited a strong inhibition effect on the growth of human gastric cancer HeLa cells.

15255990|t|Decreased histamine H1 receptor binding in the brain of depressed patients.
15255990|a|The central histaminergic neuron system modulates the wakefulness, sleep-awake cycle, appetite control, learning and memory, and emotion. Previous studies have reported changes in neuronal histamine release and its metabolism under stress conditions in the mammalian brain. In this study, we examined, using positron emission tomography (PET) and [(11)C]-doxepin, whether the histaminergic neuron system is involved in human depression. Cerebral histamine H1 receptor (H(1)R) binding was measured in 10 patients with major depression and in 10 normal age-matched subjects using PET and [(11)C]-doxepin. Data were calculated by a graphical analysis on voxel-by-voxel and ROI (region of interests) basis. Binding potential (BP) values for [(11)C]-doxepin binding in the frontal and prefrontal cortices, and cingulate gyrus were significantly lower in the depressed patients than those in the normal control subjects. There was no area of the brain where [(11)C]-doxepin binding was significantly higher in the depressed patients than in the controls. ROI-based analysis also revealed that BP values for [(11)C]-doxepin binding in the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus decreased in proportion to self-rating depressive scales scores. The results of this study demonstrate that depressed patients have decreased brain H(1)R binding and that this decrease correlates with the severity of depression symptoms. It is therefore suggested that the histaminergic neuron system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression and that its modulation may prove to be useful in the treatment of depression.

23517558|t|Intestinal and hepatic first-pass extraction of the 11b-HSD1 inhibitor AMG 221 in rats with chronic vascular catheters.
23517558|a|Abstract 1. A catheterized rat model was used to define the intestinal and hepatic components of oral bioavailability for an 11b-HSD1 inhibitor, AMG 221. These data were integrated with standard in vivo metabolism studies to elucidate the components contributing to the oral disposition of a novel drug candidate. 2. Intestinal and hepatic extraction ratios of AMG 221 obtained using a five-catheter rat model were 0.56 and 0.32, respectively. Therefore, both intestinal and hepatic extraction contributed to the first-pass component of oral bioavailability. There was no evidence for significant gut extraction of systemically administered drug. 3. Mass balance data and in vivo metabolite characterization obtained after administration of [(14)C] AMG 221 to rat showed that AMG 221 was completely absorbed from the gut lumen following an oral dose, primarily excreted in urine and was almost completely metabolized prior to excretion. 4. Hepatic bioavailability (FH), measured in two animals at various time points after oral dose administration was somewhat variable but generally characterized by an initial reduction during the absorption phase followed by an increase during the elimination phase, consistent with hepatic distribution of AMG 221. 5. The five-catheter rat model afforded estimates of hepatic and intestinal contribution to oral bioavailability that were used with other data to define the preclinical ADME characteristics of a drug candidate.

11695255|t|Analgesia and COX-2 inhibition.
11695255|a|While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of therapy for the management of acute pain and rheumatoid arthritis, toxicity associated with chronic administration limits their benefit-to-risk relationship in many patients. A series of studies is reviewed that assesses the relationship between cytokines released at the site of tissue injury and NSAID analgesia, and the in vivo selectivity of a selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) in comparison to a dual COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor (ketorolac). Three replicate studies in the oral surgery model of acute pain used submucosal microdialysis sample collection for the measurement of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; a product of both COX-1 and COX-2) and thromboxane B2 (as a biomarker for COX-1 activity) with parallel assessments of pain. The time course of PGE2 production was consistent with early release due to COX-1 activity followed by increased production 2-3 hours after surgery, consistent with COX-2 expression. Ketorolac 30 mg at pain onset suppressed both pain and peripheral PGE2 levels. Ketorolac 1 mg either at the site of injury or intramuscularly also produced analgesia but without any effect on peripheral PGE2 levels. Celecoxib selectively suppressed PGE2 but not TxB2 at time points consistent with COX-2 activity, while producing analgesia. These studies demonstrate the ability to assess the time course and selective effects of COX-2 inhibitors in vivo and suggest that suppression of COX-2 mediated PGE2 is temporally related to NSAID analgesia.

11009561|t|Oral administration of tetrahydrobiopterin prevents endothelial dysfunction and vascular oxidative stress in the aortas of insulin-resistant rats.
11009561|a|We have reported that a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), an active cofactor of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), contributes to the endothelial dysfunction through reduced eNOS activity and increased superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) generation in the insulin-resistant state. To further confirm this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of dietary treatment with BH(4) on endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation and vascular oxidative stress in the aortas of insulin-resistant rats. Oral supplementation of BH(4) (10 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) for 8 weeks significantly increased the BH(4) content in cardiovascular tissues of rats fed high levels of fructose (fructose-fed rats). Impairment of endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation in the aortic strips of the fructose-fed rats was reversed with BH(4) treatment. The BH(4) treatment was associated with a 2-fold increase in eNOS activity as well as a 70% reduction in endothelial O(2)(-) production compared with those in fructose-fed rats. The BH(4) treatment also partially improved the insulin sensitivity and blood pressure, as well as the serum triglyceride concentration, in the fructose-fed rats. Moreover, BH(4) treatment of the fructose-fed rats markedly reduced the lipid peroxide content of both aortic and cardiac tissues and inhibited the activation of 2 redox-sensitive transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappaB and activating protein-1, which were increased in fructose-fed rats. The BH(4) treatment of control rats did not have any significant effects on these parameters. These results indicate that BH(4) augmentation is essential for the restoration of eNOS function and the reduction of vascular oxidative stress in insulin-resistant rats.

23462526|t|Cell cycle arrest, extracellular matrix changes and intrinsic apoptosis in human melanoma cells are induced by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.
23462526|a|Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) involves the selective accumulation of boron carriers in tumor tissue followed by irradiation with a thermal or epithermal neutron beam. This therapy is therefore a cellular irradiation suited to treat tumors that have infiltrated into healthy tissues. BNCT has been used clinically to treat patients with cutaneous melanomas which have a high mortality. Human normal melanocytes and melanoma cells were treated with BNCT at different boronophenylalanine concentrations for signaling pathways analysis. BNCT induced few morphological alterations in normal melanocytes, with a negligible increase in free radical production. Melanoma cells treated with BNCT showed significant extracellular matrix (ECM) changes and a significant cyclin D1 decrease, suggesting cell death by necrosis and apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, respectively. BNCT also induced a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 and a decrease in the mitochondrial electrical potential with selectivity for melanoma cells. Normal melanocytes had no significant differences due to BNCT treatment, confirming the data from the literature regarding the selectivity of BNCT. The results from this study suggest that some signaling pathways are involved in human melanoma treatment by BNCT, such as cell cycle arrest, ECM changes and intrinsic apoptosis.

23609606|t|In vitro exploration of potential mechanisms of toxicity of the human hepatotoxic drug fenclozic acid.
23609606|a|The carboxylic acid NSAID fenclozic acid exhibited an excellent preclinical safety profile and promising clinical efficacy, yet was withdrawn from clinical development in 1971 due to hepatotoxicity observed in clinical trials. A variety of modern in vitro approaches have been used to explore potential underlying mechanisms. Covalent binding studies were undertaken with [(14)C]-fenclozic acid to investigate the possible role of reactive metabolites. Time-dependent covalent binding to protein was observed in NADPH-supplemented liver microsomes, although no metabolites were detected in these incubations or in reactive metabolite trapping experiments. In human hepatocytes, covalent binding was observed at lower levels than in microsomes and a minor uncharacterizable metabolite was also observed. In addition, covalent binding was observed in incubations undertaken with dog and rat hepatocytes, where a taurine conjugate of the drug was detected. Although an acyl glucuronide metabolite was detected when liver microsomes from human, rat and dog were supplemented with UDPGA, there was no detectable UDPGA-dependent covalent binding. No effects were observed when fenclozic acid was assessed for P450-dependent and P450-independent cytotoxicity to THLE cell lines, time-dependent inhibition of five major human cytochrome P450 enzymes, inhibition of the biliary efflux transporters BSEP and MRP2 or mitochondrial toxicity to THLE or HepG2 cells. These data suggest that Phase 1 bioactivation plays a role in the hepatotoxicity of fenclozic acid and highlight the unique insight into mechanisms of human drug toxicity that can be provided by investigations of biotransformation and covalent binding to proteins.

23294326|t|Density of GM1 in nanoclusters is a critical factor in the formation of a spherical assembly of amyloid b-protein on synaptic plasma membranes.
23294326|a|The deposition of amyloid b-protein (Ab) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously found that the ganglioside-enriched microdomains (ganglioside clusters) in presynaptic neuronal membranes play a key role in the initiation of the Ab assembly process. However, not all ganglioside clusters accelerate Ab assembly. In the present study, we directly observed a spherical Ab in an atomic force microscopic study on the morphology of a reconstituted lipid bilayer composed of lipids that were extracted from a detergent-resistant membrane microdomain (DRM) fraction of synaptosomes prepared from aged mouse brain. The Ab assembly was generated on a distinctive GM1 domain, which was characterized as the Ab-sensitive ganglioside nanocluster (ASIGN). By using an artificial GM1 cluster-binding peptide, ASIGN was found to have a high density of GM1; therefore, there would be a critical density of GM1 in nanoclusters to induce Ab binding and assembly. These results suggest that ganglioside-bound Ab (GAb), which acts as an endogenous seed for Ab fibril formation in AD brains, is generated on ASIGN on synaptosomal membranes.

23473681|t|Degradation of MAC13243 and studies of the interaction of resulting thiourea compounds with the lipoprotein targeting chaperone LolA.
23473681|a|The discovery of novel small molecules that function as antibacterial agents or cellular probes of biology is hindered by our limited understanding of bacterial physiology and our ability to assign mechanism of action. We previously employed a chemical genomic strategy to identify a novel small molecule, MAC13243, as a likely inhibitor of the bacterial lipoprotein targeting chaperone, LolA. Here, we report on the degradation of MAC13243 into the active species, S-(4-chlorobenzyl)isothiourea. Analogs of this compound (e.g., A22) have previously been characterized as inhibitors of the bacterial actin-like protein, MreB. Herein, we demonstrate that the antibacterial activity of MAC13243 and the thiourea compounds are similar; these activities are suppressed or sensitized in response to increases or decreases of LolA copy number, respectively. We provide STD NMR data which confirms a physical interaction between LolA and the thiourea degradation product of MAC13243, with a Kd of ~150 uM. Taken together, we conclude that the thiourea series of compounds share a similar cellular mechanism that includes interaction with LolA in addition to the well-characterized target MreB.

17651117|t|Inhibition of platelet receptors involved in neutrophil-platelet interaction in model cardiopulmonary bypass.
17651117|a|We investigated the interactions between neutrophils, platelets, and artificial surfaces, and whether blocking of relevant receptors on platelets reduced unwanted activation responses in model cardiopulmonary bypass. Isolated neutrophils and platelets resuspended in heparin-anticoagulated plasma were recirculated with and without blocking antibodies to CD62P, CD42b, or junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C) in polyvinyl chloride tubing using a roller pump. Platelet adhesion to the tubing was inhibited by anti-CD42b and anti-CD62P, and adhesion of neutrophils by anti-JAM-C. Formation of platelet-neutrophil and platelet aggregates was reduced by anti-CD62P. Anti-JAM-C decreased platelet-neutrophil aggregation at low concentrations and platelet macroaggregates at high concentrations. Anti-CD62P increased neutrophil CD11b expression but not degranulation. Anti-JAM-C substantially increased neutrophil degranulation and slightly increased CD11b expression. Platelet activation increased when CD62P was blocked and decreased with anti-CD42b antibody. High-dose anti-JAM-C reduced platelet activation. In conclusion, inhibiting platelet and neutrophil-platelet interactions had useful effects but no single blocking antibody seemed capable of inducing only beneficial effects.

23461841|t|Serum free fatty acid levels in PCOS patients treated with glucophage, magnesium oxide and spironolactone.
23461841|a|Abstract To assess the effect of glucophage, magnesium oxide and spironolactone in altering free fatty acids (FFAs), 36 PCOS women were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 (n = 14) was treated with 500 mg glucophage po bid, group 2 (n = 10) was treated with 400 mg magnesium oxide po bid and group 3 (n = 12) was treated with 50 mg spironolactone po bid for 12 weeks. A glucose tolerance test with 75 g glucose load was performed before and after treatment, collecting blood at 0, 1 and 2 h for insulin, glucose, FFA and aldosterone. Amount of FFA before and after treatment were compared by repeated measure ANOVA and represented as area under the curve. FFA levels before treatment were 0.83 + 0.23, 0.77 + 0.15 and 0.85 + 0.28 and after treatment were 0.77 + 0.48, 0.71 + 0.18 and 0.66 + 0.25 for glucophage, magnesium oxide and spironolactone-treated patients, respectively. The FFA levels were unchanged in the groups treated with glucophage and magnesium oxide but were significantly (p < 0.03) decreased in the group treated with spironolactone. Since FFAs are known to be involved in the development of insulin resistance, these results suggest that spironolactone may be useful for lowering insulin resistance in PCOS patients.

23609963|t|LIVER X RECEPTORS, NERVOUS SYSTEM AND LIPID METABOLISM.
23609963|a|Lipids in the nervous system are represented by cholesterol and phospholipids as constituents of cell membranes and, in particular, of myelin. Therefore, lipids are finely regulated to guarantee physiological functions. In the central nervous system, cholesterol is locally synthesized due to the presence of the blood brain barrier. In the peripheral nervous system cholesterol is either uptaken by lipoproteins and/or produced by de novo biosynthesis. Defects in lipid homeostasis in these tissues lead to structural and functional changes that often result in different pathological conditions depending on the affected pathways (i.e. cholesterol biosynthesis, cholesterol efflux, fatty acid biosynthesis etc.). Alterations in cholesterol metabolism in the central nervous system are linked to several disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Niemann-Pick type C disease, and glioblastoma. In the peripheral nervous system changes in lipid metabolism are associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy that may be caused by metabolic disorders, injuries, therapeutics and autoimmune diseases. Transcription factors, such as the Liver X receptors (LXRs), regulate both cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism in several tissues including the nervous system. In the last few years several studies elucidated the biology of LXRs in nervous system due to the availability of knock-out mice and the development of synthetic ligands. Here, we review a survey of the literature focused on central and peripheral nervous system and in physiological and pathological settings with particular attention on the roles played by LXRs in both districts.

23434640|t|Synthesis and cytotoxicity of 3-aryl acrylic amide derivatives of the simplified saframycin-ecteinascidin skeleton prepared from l-dopa.
23434640|a|Twenty four compounds with diversified 3-aryl acrylic amide side chains of the simplified saframycin-ecteinascidin pentacyclic skeleton were synthesized via a 14-step stereospecific route starting from l-dopa. The cytotoxicities of these compounds were tested against eight human tumor cell lines including HCT-8, BEL-7402, BGC-803, A549, A2780, MCF-7, MX-1, and MDA-MB-231. Most of these compounds exhibited potent antitumor activity, and a preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) was discussed. Compound 28 with 3-thiophenyl acrylic amide side chain exhibited selective cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cell line with the IC50 value of 50 nM.

15285788|t|Significant receptor affinities of metabolites and a degradation product of mometasone furoate.
15285788|a|Mometasone furoate (MF) is a highly potent glucocorticoid used topically to treat inflammation in the lung, nose and on the skin. However, so far no information has been published on the human glucocorticoid receptor activity of the metabolites or degradation products of MF. We have now determined the relative receptor binding affinities of the known metabolite 6beta-OH MF and the degradation product 9,11-epoxy MF to understand their possible contribution to undesirable systemic side effects. In competition experiments with human lung glucocorticoid receptors we have determined the relative receptor affinities (RRA) of these substances with reference to dexamethasone (RRA = 100). We have discovered that 6beta-OH MF and 9,11-epoxy MF display RRAs of 206 +/- 15 and 220 +/- 22, respectively. This level of activity is similar to that of the clinically used inhaled corticosteroid flunisolide (RRA 180 +/- 11). Furthermore we observed that 9,11-epoxy MF is a chemically reactive metabolite. In recovery experiments with human plasma and lung tissue we found a time dependent decrease in extractability of the compound. Hence, we provide data that might contribute to the understanding of the pharmacokinetics as well as the clinical effects of MF.

17090056|t|Transition-state structure of human 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase.
17090056|a|Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) and computer modeling using density functional theory were used to approximate the transition state of human 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP). KIEs were measured on the arsenolysis of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) catalyzed by MTAP and were corrected for the forward commitment to catalysis. Intrinsic KIEs were obtained for [1'-(3)H], [1'-(14)C], [2'-(3)H], [4'-(3)H], [5'-(3)H(2)], [9-(15)N], and [Me-(3)H(3)] MTAs. The primary intrinsic KIEs (1'-(14)C and 9-(15)N) suggest that MTAP has a dissociative S(N)1 transition state with its cationic center at the anomeric carbon and insignificant bond order to the leaving group. The 9-(15)N intrinsic KIE of 1.039 also establishes an anionic character for the adenine leaving group, whereas the alpha-primary 1'-(14)C KIE of 1.031 indicates significant nucleophilic participation at the transition state. Computational matching of the calculated EIEs to the intrinsic isotope effects places the oxygen nucleophile 2.0 Angstrom from the anomeric carbon. The 4'-(3)H KIE is sensitive to the polarization of the 3'-OH group. Calculations suggest that a 4'-(3)H KIE of 1.047 is consistent with ionization of the 3'-OH group, indicating formation of a zwitterion at the transition state. The transition state has cationic character at the anomeric carbon and is anionic at the 3'-OH oxygen, with an anionic leaving group. The isotope effects predicted a 3'-endo conformation for the ribosyl zwitterion, corresponding to a H1'-C1'-C2'-H2' torsional angle of 33 degrees. The [Me-(3)H(3)] and [5'-(3)H(2)] KIEs arise predominantly from the negative hyperconjugation of the lone pairs of sulfur with the sigma (C-H) antibonding orbitals. Human MTAP is characterized by a late S(N)1 transition state with significant participation of the phosphate nucleophile.

23500061|t|Anti-apoptotic cardioprotective effects of SHP-1 gene silencing against ischemia-reperfusion injury: Use of deoxycholic acid-modified low molecular weight polyethyleneimine as a cardiac siRNA-carrier.
23500061|a|The cardiomyocyte apoptosis plays a critical role in the development of myocardial injury after ischemia and reperfusion. Thus, alteration of the major apoptosis-regulatory factors during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion is expected to have favorable cardioprotective effects. Herein, we report ischemic-reperfused myocardial infarction (MI) repair with siRNA against Src homology region 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), which is known as a key factor involved in regulating the progress of apoptosis in many cell types. A low molecular weight polyethyleneimine modified with deoxycholic acid (PEI1.8-DA)-based delivery strategy was suggested for the cardiac application of SHP-1 siRNA to overcome the poor gene delivery efficiency to myocardium due to the highly charged structures of the compact cardiac muscles. The PEI1.8-DA conjugates formed stable nanocomplexes with SHP-1 siRNA via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes effectively silenced SHP-1 gene expression in cardiomyocytes, leading to a significant inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis under hypoxia. In comparison to conventional gene carriers, relatively large amounts of siRNA molecules remained after treatment with the PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes. Cardiac administration of the PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes resulted in substantial improvement in SHP-1 gene silencing, which can be explained by the enhancement of cardiac delivery efficiency of the PEI1.8-DA conjugates. In addition, in vivo treatment with the PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes induced a highly significant reduction in myocardial apoptosis and infarct size in rat MI models. These results demonstrate that the PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplex formulation is a useful system for efficient gene delivery into the compact myocardium that provides a fundamental advantage in treating ischemic-reperfused MI.

22709946|t|Enhanced mGlu5-receptor dependent long-term depression at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse of congenitally learned helpless rats.
22709946|a|Alterations of the glutamatergic system have been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of major depression. In order to investigate the expression and function of mGlu5 receptors in an animal model for treatment-resistant depression we used rats bred for congenital learned helplessness (cLH) and the control strain, bred for resistance against inescapable stress, congenitally. not learned helpless rats (cNLH). Western blot analysis showed an increased expression of mGlu5 (but not mGlu1a) receptors in the hippocampus of cLH rats, as compared with control cNLH rats. We also examined mGlu1/5 receptor signaling by in vivo measurement of DHPG-stimulated polyphosphoinositides hydrolysis. Stimulation of (3)H-inositolmonophosphate formation induced by i.c.v. injection of DHPG was enhanced by about 50% in the hippocampus of cLH rats. Correspondingly, DHPG-induced long-term depression (LTD) at Schaffer collateral/CA1 pyramidal cell synapses was amplified in hippocampal slices of cLH rats, whereas LTD induced by low frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals did not change. Moreover, these effects were associated with decreased basal dendritic spine density of CA1 pyramidal cell in cLH rats. These data raise the attractive possibility that changes in the expression and function of mGlu5 receptors in the hippocampus might underlie the changes in synaptic plasticity associated with the depressive-like phenotype of cLH rats. However, chronic treatment of cLH rats with MPEP did not reverse learned helplessness, indicating that the enhanced mGlu5 receptor function is not the only player in the behavioral phenotype of this genetic model of depression. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors'.

11255924|t|On the relationship between the dopamine transporter and the reinforcing effects of local anesthetics in rhesus monkeys: practical and theoretical concerns.
11255924|a|RATIONALE: Drugs that are self-administered appear to vary in their potency and effectiveness as positive reinforcers. Understanding mechanisms that determine relative effectiveness of drugs as reinforcers will enhance our understanding of drug abuse. OBJECTIVES: The hypothesis of the present study was that differences among dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands in potency and effectiveness as a positive reinforcers were related to potency and effectiveness as DA uptake inhibitors. Accordingly, self-administration of a group of local anesthetics that are DAT ligands was compared to their effects as DA uptake blockers in vitro in brain tissue. METHODS: Rhesus monkeys were allowed to self-administer cocaine and other local anesthetics i.v. under a progressive-ratio schedule. The same compounds were compared in standard in vitro DA uptake assays using monkey caudate tissue. RESULTS: The rank order of both potency and effectiveness as reinforcers was cocaine > dimethocaine > procaine > chloroprocaine. Tetracaine did not maintain self-administration. For inhibiting DA uptake, the potency order was cocaine > dimethocaine > tetracaine > procaine > chloro-procaine. At maximum, these compounds were equally effective in blocking DA uptake. Lidocaine did not inhibit DA uptake. CONCLUSIONS: The potency of local anesthetics as positive reinforcers is likely related to their potency as DA uptake inhibitors. Variation in their effectiveness as positive reinforcers was not a function of differences in effectiveness as DA uptake blockers, but may be related to relative potency over the concentrations that are achieved in vivo. Effects at sodium channels may limit the reinforcing effects of local anesthetics.

23537702|t|Systematic evaluation of 640 FDA drugs for their effect on CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells using a novel cell-based high throughput screening assay.
23537702|a|Regulatory T cells (Treg), which play a pivotal role in maintaining immune homeostasis by suppressing the proliferation of effector T cells, have great therapeutic potential for autoimmune diseases and transplantation. However, progress on their clinical application has been hampered by the lack of high throughput screening (HTS) strategies for the systematic and rapid evaluation of existing drugs and the identification of novel drug candidates. In this report, we present an innovative in vitro HTS assay using CD4(+) T cells from Foxp3-GFP transgenic mice that specifically express the GFP signal in Foxp3(+) Treg cells detectable by FACS analysis in a high throughput manner. Systematic evaluation of 640 FDA-approved drugs revealed that 70 drugs increased the number of Treg cells with suppression function only in the presence of TGFb, 75 drugs increased Treg numbers even in the absence of TGFb, and 32 drugs increased Treg numbers synergistically with TGFb. The identified Treg-promoting drugs include those previously known to induce Treg (rapamycin and retinoic acid), statins, glucocorticoids and drugs in many other categories. Furthermore, Treg cells cultured with the identified drugs possess surface and intracellular markers characteristic of natural Treg cells and possess suppressive function. These results suggest that this Treg HTS assay can be used to screen compound libraries to identify novel chemical entities for Treg-based immune therapies.

23321689|t|Activation of the a7 nicotinic ACh receptor induces anxiogenic effects in rats which is blocked by a 5-HT1a receptor antagonist.
23321689|a|The a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is highly expressed in different regions of the brain and is associated with cognitive function as well as anxiety. Agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the a7 subtype of nAChRs have been shown to improve cognition. Previously nicotine, which activates both a7 and non-a7 subtypes of nAChRs, has been shown to have an anxiogenic effect in behavioral tests. In this study, we compared the effects of the a7-selective agonist (PNU-282987) and PAM (PNU-120596) in a variety of behavioral tests in Sprague Dawley rats to look at their effects on learning and memory as well as anxiety. We found that neither PNU-282987 nor PNU-120596 improved spatial-learning or episodic memory by themselves. However when cognitive impairment was induced in the rats with scopolamine (1 mg/kg), both PNU-120596 and PNU-282987 were able to reverse this memory impairment and restore it back to normal levels. While PNU-120596 reversed the scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, it did not have any adverse effect on anxiety. PNU-282987 on the other hand displayed an increase in anxiety-like behavior at a higher dose (10 mg/kg) that was significantly reduced by the serotonin 5-HT1a receptor antagonist WAY-100135. However the a7 receptor antagonist methyllycaconitine was unable to reverse these anxiety-like effects seen with PNU-282987. These results suggest that a7 nAChR PAMs are pharmacologically advantageous over agonists, and should be considered for further development as therapeutic drugs targeting the a7 receptors.

9003761|t|Cloning, functional expression and brain localization of a novel unconventional outward rectifier K+ channel.
9003761|a|Human TWIK-1, which has been cloned recently, is a new structural type of weak inward rectifier K+ channel. Here we report the structural and functional properties of TREK-1, a mammalian TWIK-1-related K+ channel. Despite a low amino acid identity between TWIK-1 and TREK-1 (approximately 28%), both channel proteins share the same overall structural arrangement consisting of two pore-forming domains and four transmembrane segments (TMS). This structural similarity does not give rise to a functional analogy. K+ currents generated by TWIK-1 are inwardly rectifying while K+ currents generated by TREK-1 are outwardly rectifying. These channels have a conductance of 14 pS. TREK-1 currents are insensitive to pharmacological agents that block TWIK-1 activity such as quinine and quinidine. Extensive inhibitions of TREK-1 activity are observed after activation of protein kinases A and C. TREK-1 currents are sensitive to extracellular K+ and Na+. TREK-1 mRNA is expressed in most tissues and is particularly abundant in the lung and in the brain. Its localization in this latter tissue has been studied by in situ hybridization. TREK-1 expression is high in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebellum. These results provide the first evidence for the existence of a K+ channel family with four TMS and two pore domains in the nervous system of mammals. They also show that different members in this structural family can have totally different functional properties.

9466983|t|Differential interactions of heparin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans with the selectins. Implications for the use of unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins as therapeutic agents.
9466983|a|The selectins are calcium-dependent C-type lectins that bind certain sialylated, fucosylated, sulfated glycoprotein ligands. L-selectin also recognizes endothelial proteoglycans in a calcium-dependent manner, via heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains enriched in unsubstituted glucosamine units. We now show that these HS chains can also bind P-selectin, but not E-selectin. However, while L-selectin binding requires micromolar levels of free calcium, P-selectin recognition is largely divalent cation-independent. Despite this, HS chains bound to P-selectin are eluted by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), but only at high concentrations. Porcine intestinal mucosal (mast cell-derived) heparin (PIM-heparin) shows similar properties, with no binding to E-selectin, calcium-dependent binding of a subfraction to L-selectin and to P-selectin, and calcium-independent binding of a larger fraction to P-selectin, the latter being disrupted by high EDTA concentrations. Analysis of defined heparin fragment pools shows a size dependence for interaction, with tetradecasaccharides showing easily detectable binding to L- and P-selectin affinity columns. L-selectin binding fragments include more heavily sulfated and epimerized regions and, as with the endothelial HS chains, they are enriched in free amino groups. The P-selectin binding component includes this fraction as well as some less highly modified regions. Thus, endothelium-derived HS chains and mast cell-derived heparins could play a role in modulating the biology of selectins in vivo. Notably, P- and L-selectin binding to sialyl-Lewisx and to HL-60 cells (which are known to carry the native ligand PSGL-1) is inhibited by unfractionated pharmaceutical heparin preparations at concentrations 12-50-fold lower than those recommended for effective anticoagulation in vivo. In contrast, two low molecular weight heparins currently considered as clinical replacements for unfractionated heparin are much poorer inhibitors. Thus, patients undergoing heparin therapy for other reasons may be experiencing clinically significant inhibition of L- and P-selectin function, and the current switchover to low-molecular weight heparins may come at some loss of this effect. Low-dose unfractionated heparin should be investigated as a treatment option for acute and chronic diseases in which P- and L-selectin play pathological roles.

20012638|t|Effects of bambuterol and terbutaline on isolated rat's tracheal smooth muscle.
20012638|a|Terbutaline (Bricanyl) and its prodrug Bambuterol (Bambec) are highly potent beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists often used in asthma patients. Terbutaline in the form of inhaled short-acting bronchodilator relieves asthmatic symptoms. However, the effects of bambuterol given intratracheally have rarely been explored. To verify the effect of bambuterol and terbutaline, which act on the tracheal smooth muscle directly in vitro, we used our preparation to test the effects of bambuterol on isolated rat's tracheal smooth muscle compared with terbutaline. The following assessments of bambuterol and terbutaline were performed: (1) effect on tracheal smooth muscle resting tension; (2) effect on contraction caused by 10(-6) M methacholine as a parasympathetic mimetic; (3) effect of the drugs on electrically induced tracheal smooth muscle contractions. The results indicated that adding bambuterol induced a significant further contraction to 10(-6) M methacholine-induced contraction when the preparation was increased to 10(-4) M. But terbutaline elicited a relaxation response at a dose of 10(-6) M or more. Both bambuterol and terbutaline could inhibit electrical field stimulation (EFS) induced spike contraction. Terbutaline had an anti-cholinergic effect that could relieve asthmatic symptoms. But the effect of bambuterol acting on tracheal smooth muscle directly was controversial.

23266719|t|Immunomodulatory properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects and allergic patients.
23266719|a|In the present study, we investigated the immunomodulatory activity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and mite-allergic subjects. Freshly prepared PBMCs, stimulated or not with Toll-like receptor (TLR)1-9 agonists, a T cell mitogen (phytohemagglutinin A) or mite allergen extract were cultured in the presence or absence of MWCNTs. Secretion of TNF-a, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12/23p40 or IFN-g was quantified in the culture supernatants by ELISA. Basal secretion of all the cytokines was not altered by MWCNTs in PBMCs from both healthy donors and allergic subjects. In PBMCs from healthy donors, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12/23p40 secretion in response to the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide was however increased in a dose-dependent manner by MWCNTs. Significant increases in the release of these cytokines were also observed in PBMCs stimulated with a TLR2 or TLR3 agonist. MWCNTs also increased the release of IL-2 and IFN-g by PBMCs stimulated with a T cell mitogen. In contrast, MWCNTs inhibited allergen-induced IL-5 secretion by PBMCs from mite-allergic subjects. As well, MWCNTs altered the capacity of PBMC-derived monocytes to differentiate into functional dendritic cells. All together, our data suggest that according to its immune cell target, MWCNTs may either promote or suppress immune responses in humans. Further investigations are necessary to fully understand the complexity behind interactions of engineered nanoparticles with the immune system.

17391279|t|In vivo effects of amtolmetin guacyl on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defence systems. Comparison with non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs.
17391279|a|1. The in vivo effects of the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) amtolmetin guacyl, a pro-drug of the NSAID tolmetin, on lipid peroxidation, glutathione levels and activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase) in rat gastric mucosa, colon mucosa and liver, were compared with the effects of non-selective (indomethacin, diclofenac) and COX-2 selective (celecoxib) NSAIDs. 2. Indomethacin treatment led to an increase in lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities and to a decrease in catalase activity and glutathione levels in gastric mucosa. In contrast, amtolmetin guacyl treatment was without effects in gastric and colon mucosa, or liver from control animals. Like amtolmetin guacyl, celecoxib had no effect on the lipid peroxidation, or on enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidant defence systems in gastric mucosa. 3. It is suggested that the lack of pro-oxidant effects in vivo associated with amtolmetin guacyl treatment contribute improved gastric tolerability.

7926307|t|STZ transport and cytotoxicity. Specific enhancement in GLUT2-expressing cells.
7926307|a|The glucose analog streptozotocin (STZ) has long been used as a tool for creating experimental diabetes because of its relatively specific beta-cell cytotoxic effect, but the mechanism by which systemic injection of STZ causes beta-cell destruction is not well understood. In the current study, we have used insulinoma (RIN) and AtT-20ins cell lines engineered for overexpression of GLUT2 or GLUT1 to investigate the role of glucose transporter isoforms in mediating STZ cytotoxicity. The in vivo effects of STZ were evaluated by implantation of RIN cells expressing or lacking GLUT2 into athymic nude rats. The drug had a potent cytotoxic effect on RIN cells expressing GLUT2, but had no effect on cells lacking GLUT2 expression, as indicated by histological analysis and measurement of the blood glucose levels of treated animals. The preferential cytotoxic effect of STZ on GLUT2-expressing cell lines was confirmed by in vitro analysis of GLUT2-expressing and untransfected RIN cells, as well as GLUT2- and GLUT1-overexpressing AtT-20ins cells. Consistent with these data, only GLUT2-expressing RIN or AtT-20ins cells transported STZ efficiently. We conclude that expression of GLUT2 is required for efficient killing of neuroendocrine cells by STZ, and this effect is related to specific recognition of the drug as a transported substrate by GLUT2 but not GLUT1.

23288049|t|Toxicity of the flame-retardant BDE-49 on brain mitochondria and neuronal progenitor striatal cells enhanced by a PTEN-deficient background.
23288049|a|Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) represent an important group of flame retardants extensively used, tonnage of which in the environment has been steadily increasing over the past 25 years. PBDEs or metabolites can induce neurotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) through a variety of mechanisms. Recently, PBDEs with < 5 Br substitutions (i.e., 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether [BDE-47] and 2,2',4,5'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether [BDE-49]) have gained interest because of their high bioaccumulation. In particular, congeners such as BDE-49 arise as one of the most biologically active, with concentrations typically lower than those observed for BDE-47 in biological tissues; however, its potential to cause MD at biologically relevant concentrations is unknown. To this end, the effect of BDE-49 was studied in brain mitochondria and neuronal progenitor striatal cells (NPC). BDE-49 uncoupled mitochondria at concentrations < 0.1 nM, whereas at > 1 nM, it inhibited the electron transport at Complex V (mixed type inhibition; IC(50) = 6 nM) and Complex IV (noncompetitive inhibition; IC(50) = 40 nM). These concentrations are easily achieved in plasma concentrations considering that BDE-49 (this study, 400-fold) and other PBDEs accumulate 1-3 orders of magnitude in the cells, particularly in mitochondria and microsomes. Similar effects were observed in NPC and exacerbated with PTEN (negative modulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway) deficiency, background associated with autism-like behavior, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. PBDE-mediated MD per se or enhanced by a background that confers susceptibility to this exposure may have profound implications in the energy balance of brain.

18620538|t|Interaction of human alpha-lactalbumin with fatty acids: determination of binding parameters.
18620538|a|The interaction of holo- and apo-forms of human alpha-lactalbumin with fatty acids was studied by a partition equilibrium method. Apo-alpha-lactalbumin, obtained by treatment with EDTA, displays one binding site for fatty acids, the association constants for oleic and palmitic acids being 1.9.10(6) and 4.2.10(5) M(-1), respectively. However, holo-alpha-lactalbumin was unable to bind fatty acids as measured by this technique. Likewise, no fatty acids bound to holo-alpha-lactalbumin, isolated using nondenaturing conditions, were detected by gas chromatography. These results demonstrate that the conformational change induced in alpha-lactalbumin by the removal of calcium enables the protein to interact with fatty acids.

23123257|t|Reduced in vitro and in vivo toxicity of siRNA-lipoplexes with addition of polyglutamate.
23123257|a|We previously designed a new siRNA vector that efficiently silences genes in vitro and in vivo. The vector originality is based on the fact that, in addition to the siRNA molecule, it contains two components: 1) a cationic liposome that auto-associates with the siRNA to form particles called "lipoplexes" and, 2) an anionic polymer which enhances the lipoplex's efficiency. This anionic polymer can be a nucleic acid, a polypeptide or a polysaccharide. We show here how the nature of the added anionic polymer into our siRNA delivery system impacts the toxic effects induced by siRNA lipoplexes. We first observed that: (i) siRNA lipoplexes-induced toxicity was cell line dependent, tumoral cell lines being the more sensitive; and (ii) plasmid DNA-containing siRNA lipoplexes were more toxic than polyglutamate-containing ones or cationic liposomes. We next determined that the toxicity induced by plasmid-containing lipoplexes is a long-lasting effect that decreased cell survival capacity for several generations. We also found that treated cells underwent death following apoptosis pathway. Systemic injection to mice of siRNA lipoplexes, rather than of cationic liposome, triggered a production of several cytokines in mice and replacement of plasmid by polyglutamate reduced the elevation of all assayed cytokines. In order to enhance siRNA lipoplexes efficiency, the addition of polyglutamate as anionic polymer should be preferred to plasmid DNA as far as in vitro as well as in vivo toxicity is concerned.

23339076|t|Structure prediction of binary pernitride MN2 compounds (M=Ca, Sr, Ba, La, and Ti).
23339076|a|Metal-pernitride compounds belong to a class of chemical systems in which both the complex ions and the non-bonding electrons may play roles in the formation of their modified crystalline structures. To investigate this issue, the energy landscapes of pernitrides of metals with different maximum valence (M=Ca, Sr, Ba, La, and Ti) were globally explored on the ab initio level at standard and high pressures, thereby yielding possible (meta)stable modifications in these systems together with information on how the landscape changed as function of the valence of the metal cation. For all of the systems in which no compounds had been synthesized so far, we predicted the existence of kinetically stable modifications that should, in principle, be experimentally accessible. In particular, TiN2 should crystallize in a new structure type, TiN2-I.

23494236|t|Reinforcement enhancing effects of nicotine via smoking.
23494236|a|RATIONALE: In animals, nicotine enhances reinforcement from stimuli unrelated to nicotine intake. Human research is suggestive but has not clearly shown a similar influence of nicotine. OBJECTIVES: We assessed acute effects of nicotine via smoking on enhancement of positive (money, music) or negative (termination of noise) reinforcers, or no "reward" (control). These different rewards determined the generalizability of nicotine effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dependent (n = 25) and nondependent (n = 27) smokers participated in three sessions, each after overnight abstinence. Using a within-subjects design, sessions involved no smoking or smoking denicotinized (0.05 mg) or nicotine (0.6 mg) Quest(R) brand cigarettes. For comparison, a fourth session involved no abstinence prior to smoking one's own brand to gauge responses under typical nicotine satiation. Reinforcement was assessed by responses on a simple operant computer task for the rewards, each available singly on a progressive ratio schedule during separate trials. RESULTS: The reinforcing effect of music, but not other rewards, was greater due to the nicotine cigarette, compared to the denicotinized cigarette or no smoking. Reinforcement enhancing effects of nicotine did not differ between dependent and nondependent groups, indicating no influence of withdrawal relief. Responding due to acute nicotine after abstinence was very similar to responding to one's own brand after no abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Acute nicotine intake per se from smoking after abstinence enhances the reinforcing value of rewards unassociated with smoking, perhaps in a manner comparable to ad lib smoking after no abstinence. Nicotine's reinforcement enhancing effects may be specific to certain rewards, perhaps those sensory in nature.

23567861|t|Evaluation of 7-O-galloyl-d-sedoheptulose, isolated from Corni Fructus, in the adipose tissue of type 2 diabetic db/db mice.
23567861|a|The aim of the present study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of 7-O-galloyl-d-sedoheptulose (GS), isolated from Corni Fructus, using type 2 diabetic mice. GS was orally administered to db/db mice at doses of 20 and 100mg/kg body weight per day for 6weeks, and the effects of GS on biochemical factors in serum and adipose tissue were investigated. To define the underlying mechanism of these effects, protein expressions related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis, were measured. The results showed that levels of glucose, leptin, insulin, C-peptide, resistin, tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, triglycerides, total cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) in serum were down-regulated, while adiponectin was augmented by GS treatment. In addition, the elevated lipid, ROS, and TBARS contents in adipose tissue as well as serum levels in db/db mice were significantly decreased by the oral administration of GS. From protein analysis, the decreased expressions of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)a, PPARg, and B-cell lymphoma 2 were up-regulated in the adipose tissue of db/db mice. The administration of GS significantly decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, nuclear factor-kappa ?>Bp65, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, phosphor c-Jun N-terminal kinase, activator protein-1, transforming growth factor-b1, Bax, cytochrome c, and caspase-3 expressions. These results suggest that GS acts as a regulator of oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the adipose tissue of db/db mice.

23314054|t|Fragment-based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of N-substituted-5-(4-isopropylthiophenol)-2-hydroxynicotinamide derivatives as novel Mcl-1 inhibitors.
23314054|a|We have previously reported a nanomolar inhibitor of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein, 3-thiomorpholin-8-oxo-8H-acenaphtho [1,2-b] pyrrole-9-carbonitrile (S1). S1 plays its function by binding to the BH3 groove of Mcl-1. Basing on this spacial structural characteristic, we developed a novel class of Mcl-1 inhibitor using fragment-based drug discovery approach. By dissecting S1, we identified the compound 4 with a 2-hydroxypyridine core as the starting fragment. In the following molecular growth, we used the ligand efficiency evaluation and fit quality score to assess the fragments. A novel potent compound, N-benzyl-5-(4-isopropylthiophenol)-2-hydroxyl nicotinamide (12c), which binds Mcl-1 with an IC(50) value of 54 nM was obtained. Compound 12c demonstrated a better aqueous solubility than S1.

7714410|t|Preclinical efficacy of emedastine, a potent, selective histamine H1 antagonist for topical ocular use.
7714410|a|Emedastine [1-(2-ethoxyethyl)-2-(4-methyl-1-homopiperazinyl)- benzimidazole difumarate] was evaluated for topical ocular anti-histaminic activity in histamine and antigen stimulated conjunctivitis models. Concentration-dependent inhibition of histamine induced vascular permeability changes occurring in the conjunctiva was observed when the time interval between topical ocular administration and histamine challenge ranged from 1 min to 8 hr. The calculated ED50 values obtained using intervals of 1 min, 30 min, 2, 4 and 8 hr were 0.0002%, 0.000035%, 0.0029%, 0.019% and 0.19%, w/v, respectively. Comparisons of relative potency 30 min post dosing between emedastine and other anti-histamines demonstrated that emedastine is equipotent to ketotifen, and 7, 7, 10, 10, 100, 357, 3333, and 5813 times more potent than brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, pyrilamine, levocabastine, pheniramine, diphenhydramine, and antazoline, respectively. Emedastine (0.1%) failed to significantly attenuate either serotonin or platelet-activating-factor induced vascular permeability changes indicating high selectivity for the histamine H1 receptor. In a passive conjunctival anaphylaxis model in guinea pigs, significant inhibition of the allergic response was observed following topical ocular administration of emedastine 5 min or 30 min prior to antigen challenge (ED50s 0.0046% and 0.00022%, respectively). These data clearly indicate that emedastine has potential as a topical ocular anti-histamine for treating allergic conjunctivitis.

23274058|t|Jaceosidin, isolated from dietary mugwort (Artemisia princeps), induces G2/M cell cycle arrest by inactivating cdc25C-cdc2 via ATM-Chk1/2 activation.
23274058|a|Jaceosidin, a flavonoid derived from Artemisia princeps (Japanese mugwort), has been shown to inhibit the growth of several human cancer cells, However, the exact mechanism for the cytotoxic effect of jaceosidin is not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the antiproliferative effect of jaceosidin in human endometrial cancer cells. We demonstrated that jaceosidin is a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than cisplatin in human endometrial cancer cells. In contrast, jaceosidin-induced cytotoxicity in normal endometrial cells was lower than that observed for cisplatin. Jaceosidin induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and modulated the levels of cyclin B and p-Cdc2 in Hec1A cells. Knockdown of p21 using specific siRNAs partially abrogated jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition. Additional mechanistic studies revealed that jaceosidin treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of Cdc25C and ATM-Chk1/2. Ku55933, an ATM inhibitor, reversed jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition, in part. Moreover, jaceosidin treatment resulted in phosphorylation of ERK, and pretreatment with the ERK inhibitor, PD98059, attenuated cell growth inhibition by jaceosidin. These data suggest that jaceosidin, isolated from Japanese mugwort, modulates the ERK/ATM/Chk1/2 pathway, leading to inactivation of the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex, followed by G2/M cell cycle arrest in endometrial cancer cells.

15811959|t|A phase-1 trial of bexarotene and denileukin diftitox in patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
15811959|a|Denileukin diftitox, a genetically engineered fusion protein combining the enzymatically active domains of diphtheria toxin and the full-length sequence for interleukin-2 (IL-2), efficiently targets lymphoma cells expressing the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) consisting of the alpha/p55/CD25, beta/p75/CD122, and gamma/p64/CD132 chains. In vitro studies demonstrated that the retinoid X receptor (RXR) retinoid, bexarotene, at biologically relevant concentrations of 10(-6) M to 10(-8) M, upregulated both the p55 and p75 subunits of the IL-2R and enhanced 5- to 10-fold the susceptibility of T-cell leukemia cells to denileukin diftitox. To determine whether this biomodulatory effect could be recapitulated in vivo, we treated 14 patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with escalating doses of bexarotene (75 mg/day-300 mg/day) and denileukin diftitox (18 mcg/kg per day x 3 days every 21 days) in a phase 1 trial. Overall response was 67% (4 complete responses, 4 partial responses). Modulation of IL-2R expression was observed at or above a bexarotene dose of 150 mg/day. Four patients experienced grade 2 or 3 leukopenia, and 2 had grade 4 lymphopenia. Our results demonstrate that the combination of denileukin diftitox and bexarotene is well tolerated and that even low doses (150 mg/day) of bexarotene are capable of in vivo upregulation of CD25 expression on circulating leukemia cells.

12414329|t|Phosphodiesterase type 5 as a pharmacologic target in erectile dysfunction.
12414329|a|The scientific rationale of pharmacologically inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) is reviewed. Published literature on the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway for penile erection and on PDE5 inhibition using sildenafil as the model for pharmacologic PDE5 inhibition are assessed. The key second messenger in the mediation of penile erection is cGMP. PDE5 is the predominant PDE in the corpus cavernosum, and cGMP is its primary substrate. Therefore, in men with ED, elevation of cGMP in corpus cavernosal tissue via selective inhibition of cGMP-specific PDE5 is a means of improving erectile function at minimal risk of adverse events. This approach is validated by the clinical efficacy and safety of sildenafil, the pioneering drug for selective PDE5 inhibitor therapy for ED. Sildenafil exhibits inhibitory potency against PDE5 and a 10-fold lower dose-related inhibitory potency against rod outer segment PDE6, the predominant PDE in the phototransduction cascade in rods. Thus, its pharmacologic profile is predictable, with close correlation between pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. Clinically, sildenafil improves erectile function in a large percentage of men with ED. The most common adverse events are due to PDE5 inhibition in vascular and visceral smooth muscle; similar adverse events are expected during therapeutic use of all PDE5 inhibitors. As free sildenafil plasma concentrations approach concentrations sufficient to inhibit retinal PDE6, usually at higher therapeutic doses, transient, reversible visual adverse events can occur, albeit infrequently. Selective inhibition of PDE5 is a rational therapeutic approach in ED, as proved by the clinical success of sildenafil.

15526004|t|Genetic risk factors for infection in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.
15526004|a|We analyzed clinical and genetic factors contributing to infections in 457 subjects with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) enrolled in a prospective, 1-year clinical trial of methotrexate and the TNF inhibitor etanercept. Subjects were genotyped for the following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): (TNF -308, -238, and + 488); lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA) (LTA + 249, + 365, and + 720); and Fc gamma receptors FCGR2A 131 H/R; FCGR3A 176 F/V; and FCGR3B NA 1/2 and genotypes were correlated with infections. At least one URI was noted in 52% of subjects (99/191) with the NA2/NA2 genotype of the neutrophil-specific FCGR3B gene, compared to 42% (77/181) of those with the NA1/NA2 genotype and 39% (23/59) of those with the NA1/NA1 genotype (P = 0.038). Urinary tract infection (UTI) was associated with the TNF -238 A (odds ratio(OR) 2.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-6.25) and LTA +365 C (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.07-2.79) alleles, and marginally with the FCGR3A F allele (OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.99-3.00). There was a striking linear correlation between UTI and the number of risk alleles defined by these three SNPs (P < 0.001), suggesting an additive effect on susceptibility. These findings have important implications for the role of genetics in susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections.

15121646|t|A PET study of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptor occupancy in patients with schizophrenia treated with therapeutic doses of ziprasidone.
15121646|a|OBJECTIVE: Ziprasidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that shows a higher affinity for serotonin 5-HT(2) receptors compared with dopamine D(2) receptors in vitro. The affinity of ziprasidone for these receptors in vivo in patients was examined in a positron emission tomography (PET) study. METHOD: The authors conducted a PET study to evaluate D(2) occupancy (using [(11)C]raclopride) and 5-HT(2) occupancy (using [(18)F]setoperone) in brain regions of interest in 16 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder randomly assigned to receive 40, 80, 120, or 160 mg/day of ziprasidone, which reflected the recommended dose range. PET scanning was done after 3 weeks of administration and at trough plasma levels, i.e., 12-16 hours after the last dose. RESULTS: The mean 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy was significantly higher than the mean D(2) receptor occupancy (mean=76%, SD=15%, and mean=56%, SD=18%, respectively). The estimated plasma ziprasidone concentration associated with 50% maximal 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy was almost four times lower than that for D(2) receptor occupancy. CONCLUSIONS: These data affirm that ziprasidone is similar to other novel antipsychotics in having greater 5-HT(2) than D(2) receptor occupancy at therapeutic doses and suggest that the optimal effective dose of ziprasidone is closer to 120 mg/day than to the lower doses suggested by previous PET studies. The relatively high D(2) receptor occupancy, even at trough plasma levels, suggests that ziprasidone is more similar to risperidone and olanzapine in receptor occupancy profile than to clozapine and quetiapine. Since ziprasidone plasma levels show significant (more than twofold) variation within a single dose cycle, studies that are aimed at peak plasma levels (6 hours after the last dose) and that examine extrastriatal regions are required to fully characterize the in vivo occupancy profile of ziprasidone.

23643745|t|Pharmacological and genetic evidence for pre- and postsynaptic D2 receptor involvement in motor responses to nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor ligands.
23643745|a|A combined pharmacological and genetic approach was undertaken to investigate the contribution of endogenous dopamine to the motor actions of nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) receptor (NOP receptor) ligands. Motor activity was evaluated by a battery of behavioural tests in mice. The involvement of the various DA receptor subtypes in the motor effects of N/OFQ and NOP receptor antagonists was evaluated pharmacologically, using D1/D5 (SCH23390), D2/D3 (raclopride, amisulpride) and D3 (S33084) receptor antagonists, and by using D2 receptor knockout mice. Low doses of N/OFQ and NOP receptor antagonists promoted movement whereas higher doses inhibited it. Motor facilitation was selectively prevented by raclopride while motor inhibition was prevented by amisulpride. Amisulpride also attenuated the hypolocomotion induced by the D2/D3 receptor agonist pramipexole and dopamine precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, whereas raclopride (and S33084) worsened it. To dissect out the contribution of pre- and postsynaptic D2 receptors, mice lacking the D2 receptor (D2R(-/-)) or its long isoform (D2L(-/-)) were used. Motor facilitation induced by N/OFQ and NOP receptor antagonists was lost in D2R(-/-) and D2L(-/-) mice whereas motor inhibition induced by NOP receptor antagonists (and pramipexole) was lost in D2R(-/-) but preserved in D2L(-/-) mice. N/OFQ-induced hypolocomotion was observed in both genotypes. We demonstrate that motor actions of NOP receptor ligands rely on the modulation of endogenous dopamine. Motor facilitation induced by NOP receptor antagonists as well as low dose N/OFQ is mediated through D2L postsynaptic receptors whereas motor inhibition observed with higher doses of N/OFQ occurs by direct inhibition of mesencephalic DA neurons. Motor inhibition seen with high doses of NOP receptor antagonists appears to be mediated through the D2 presynaptic autoreceptors. These data confirm that endogenous N/OFQ is a powerful modulator of dopamine transmission in vivo and that the effects of NOP receptor antagonists on motor function reflect the blockade of this endogenous N/OFQ tone.

23473032|t|In vivo HIF-mediated reductive carboxylation is regulated by citrate levels and sensitizes VHL-deficient cells to glutamine deprivation.
23473032|a|Hypoxic and VHL-deficient cells use glutamine to generate citrate and lipids through reductive carboxylation (RC) of a-ketoglutarate. To gain insights into the role of HIF and the molecular mechanisms underlying RC, we took advantage of a panel of disease-associated VHL mutants and showed that HIF expression is necessary and sufficient for the induction of RC in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. HIF expression drastically reduced intracellular citrate levels. Feeding VHL-deficient RCC cells with acetate or citrate or knocking down PDK-1 and ACLY restored citrate levels and suppressed RC. These data suggest that HIF-induced low intracellular citrate levels promote the reductive flux by mass action to maintain lipogenesis. Using [(1-13)C]glutamine, we demonstrated in vivo RC activity in VHL-deficient tumors growing as xenografts in mice. Lastly, HIF rendered VHL-deficient cells sensitive to glutamine deprivation in vitro, and systemic administration of glutaminase inhibitors suppressed the growth of RCC cells as mice xenografts.

23542114|t|Arsenic trioxide depletes cancer stem-like cells and inhibits repopulation of neurosphere derived from glioblastoma by downregulation of Notch pathway.
23542114|a|Notch signaling has been demonstrated to have a central role in cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We have recently demonstrated the inhibitory effect of arsenic trioxide (ATO) on CSLCs in glioblastoma cell lines. In this study we used neurosphere recovery assay that measured neurosphere formation at three time points to assess the capacity of the culture to repopulate after ATO treatment. Our results provided strong evidence that ATO depleted CSLCs in GBM, and inhibited neurosphere recovery and secondary neurosphere formation. ATO inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of AKT and STAT3 through Notch signaling blockade. These data show that the ATO is a promising new approach to decrease glioblastoma proliferation and recurrence by downregulation of Notch pathway.

16854582|t|Effect of keratinocyte growth factor on cell viability in primary cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells.
16854582|a|In normal prostate, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), also known as fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF-7) serves as a paracrine growth factor synthesized in stromal cells that acts on epithelial cells through its receptor, KGFR. KGF and KGFR were found in human cancer epithelial cells as well as stromal cells. Since KGF expressed in epithelial cells of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in prostate cancer, it has been suggested that KGF might act as an autocrine factor in BPH and prostate cancer. To investigate the roles of KGF in cancerous stroma, primary cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells (PCSCs) were isolated and evaluated. These PCSCs possessed estrogen receptors and KGFR, but not androgen receptor as determined by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. KGF exhibited mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects that correlated with induction of cyclin-D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and phospho-Akt expression in PCSCs, where treatment with KGF antiserum abolished cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic protein expression. PCSCs exposed to KGF for various time periods resulted in phosphorylation of Akt and subsequent up-regulation of Bcl-2. KGF modulated dynamic protein expression indicated that KGF triggered cell cycle machinery and then activated anti-apoptotic actions in PCSCs. Cell proliferation analysis indicated that tamoxifen or ICI 182,780 reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner; however, KGF prevented this inhibition, which further demonstrated KGF triggered anti-apoptotic machinery through activating Bcl-2 and phospho-Akt expression. In summary, KGF has an autocrine effect and serves as a survival factor in primary cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells.

11034583|t|Effects of a serotonin 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist SB-207266 on gastrointestinal motor and sensory function in humans.
11034583|a|BACKGROUND: Serotonin 5-HT(4) receptors are located on enteric cholinergic neurones and may regulate peristalsis. 5-HT(4) receptors on primary afferent neurones have been postulated to modulate visceral sensation. While 5-HT(4) agonists are used as prokinetic agents, the physiological role of 5-HT(4) receptors in the human gut is unknown. AIMS: Our aim was to characterise the role of 5-HT(4) receptors in regulating gastrointestinal motor and sensory function in healthy subjects under baseline and stimulated conditions with a 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist. METHODS: Part A compared the effects of placebo to four doses of a 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist (SB-207266) on the cisapride mediated increase in plasma aldosterone (a 5-HT(4) mediated response) and orocaecal transit in 18 subjects. In part B, 52 healthy subjects received placebo, or 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg of SB-207266 for 10-12 days; gastric, small bowel, and colonic transit were measured by scintigraphy on days 7-9, and fasting and postprandial colonic motor function, compliance, and sensation during distensions were assessed on day 12. RESULTS: Part A: 0.5, 5, and 20 mg doses of SB-207266 had significant and quantitatively similar effects, antagonising the cisapride mediated increase in plasma aldosterone and acceleration of orocaecal transit. Part B: SB-207266 tended to delay colonic transit (geometric centre of isotope at 24 (p=0.06) and 48 hours (p=0.08)), but did not have dose related effects on transit, fasting or postprandial colonic motor activity, compliance, or sensation. CONCLUSION: 5-HT(4) receptors are involved in the regulation of cisapride stimulated orocaecal transit; SB 207266 tends to modulate colonic transit but not sensory functions or compliance in healthy human subjects.

16268464|t|Association of MTRRA66G polymorphism (but not of MTHFR C677T and A1298C, MTRA2756G, TCN C776G) with homocysteine and coronary artery disease in the French population.
16268464|a|Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism (MTHFR C677T) is an established determinant of homocysteine plasma level (t-Hcys) while its association with coronary artery disease (CAD) seems to be more limited. In contrast, the association of the substitutions A2756G of methionine synthase (MTR), A66G of methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) and C776G of transcobalamin (TCN) to both t-Hcys and CAD needs to be evaluated further. The objective was to evaluate the association of these polymorphisms with t-Hcys and CAD in a French population. We investigated the individual and combined effects of these polymorphisms and of vitamin B12 and folates with t-Hcys in 530 CAD patients and 248 matched healthy controls. t-Hcys was higher in the CAD group than in controls (11.8 vs 10.4 microM, P < 0.0001) and in carriers of MTRRAA and MTHFR 677TT than in those carrying the most frequent allele of both polymorphisms (13.8 vs 11.4 microM, P = 0.0102 and 12.5 vs 11.0 mM, P = 0.0065 respectively). The frequency of MTRR A allele was higher in CAD patients than in controls (0.48 [95% CI: 0.44-0.52] vs 0.38 [95% CI: 0.32-0.44], P = 0.0081) while no difference was observed for MTHFR 677T frequency. In multivariate analysis, t-Hcys > median and MTRRAA genotype were two significant independent predictors of CAD with respective odds ratios of 3.1 (95 % CI: 1.8-5.1, P < 0.0001) and 4.5 (95% CI: 1.5-13.1, P = 0.0051). In conclusion, in contrast to North Europe studies, MTRRAA genotype is a genetic determinant of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia associated with CAD in a French population without vitamin fortification.

22893351|t|A significant dose-dependent relationship between mercury exposure from dental amalgams and kidney integrity biomarkers: A further assessment of the Casa Pia children's dental amalgam trial.
22893351|a|Dental amalgams are a commonly used dental restorative material. Amalgams are about 50% mercury (Hg), and Hg is known to significantly accumulate in the kidney. It was hypothesized that because Hg accumulates in the proximal tubules (PTs), glutathione-S-transferases (GST)-a (suggestive of kidney damage at the level of PT) would be expected to be more related to Hg exposure than GST-p (suggestive of kidney damage at the level of the distal tubules). Urinary biomarkers of kidney integrity were examined in children of 8-18 years old, with and without dental amalgam fillings, from a completed clinical trial (parent study). Our study determined whether there was a significant dose-dependent correlation between increasing Hg exposure from dental amalgams and GST-a and GST-p as biomarkers of kidney integrity. Overall, the present study, using a different and more sensitive statistical model than the parent study, revealed a statistically significant dose-dependent correlation between cumulative exposure to Hg from dental amalgams and urinary levels of GST-a, after covariate adjustment; where as, a nonsignificant relationship was observed with urinary levels of GST-p. Furthermore, it was observed that urinary GST-a levels increased by about 10% over the 8-year course of the study among individuals with an average exposure to amalgams among the study subjects from the amalgam group, in comparison with study subjects with no exposure to dental amalgams. The results of our study suggest that dental amalgams contribute to ongoing kidney damage at the level of the PTs in a dose-dependent fashion.

12614192|t|Long-term use of sildenafil.
12614192|a|The treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been revolutionised by new agents to inhibit the enzyme PDE5. The scientific basis of this treatment of ED includes relaxation of the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle tissue by inhibition of PDE5 that breaks down cGMP, the key pathway for the production of erectile function in humans. Many clinical studies, both pre- and post-marketing, have demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety of sildenafil (Viagra, Pfizer) - the first approved selective PDE inhibitor for the treatment of ED. Sildenafil is inhibitory of PDE5 at a rate tenfold higher than for the next PDE (PDE6), which produces visual changes through the retinal rods. Its clinical effectiveness has been well documented in the majority of men with ED irrespective of aetiology. The aetiology of ED, also, does not appear to effect the function of sildenafil in relaxing corpus cavernosum smooth muscle tissue. Adverse events are usually associated with the vascular changes from PDE5 inhibition. These include headache and flushing. Each of these adverse events, however, declines with medication use. With the use of sildenafil, it has been clearly, clinically demonstrated that the selective inhibition of PDE5 is an appropriate, effective, safe method for the treatment of ED of all aetiologies and severities.

12852767|t|Tethered dimers as NAD synthetase inhibitors with antibacterial activity.
12852767|a|The solution-phase parallel synthesis of tethered dimers was employed to identify lead inhibitors of bacterial NAD synthetase. Active dimers contained two aromatic end groups joined by a polymethylene linker, with one end group containing a permanent positive charge. Effective inhibitors of NAD synthetase also inhibited the growth of Gram-positive (but not Gram-negative) bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains. The desmethyl precursors of active inhibitors lacked a permanent positive charge and were inactive as either enzyme inhibitors or antibacterial agents. Similarly, a close structural analogue of the most active inhibitors contained two additional ether oxygens in the tether and was inactive in both assays. These results are consistent with the premise that NAD synthetase inhibition is responsible for the antibacterial actions and support further studies on NAD synthetase as a new target for antibacterial agents.

23504356|t|Pharmacotherapy for the core symptoms in autistic disorder: current status of the research.
23504356|a|The current review covers extant literature on pharmacotherapy for core symptoms of autism. The core symptoms of autism include impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors. There are no known efficacious treatments for the core social symptoms, although effects on repetitive behaviors are indicated with some data. While studies of fenfluramine, secretin, opiates, and mood stabilizers generally find no effect, mixed results suggest more research is needed on antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics. Newer lines of research, including cholinergic and glutamatergic agents and oxytocin, will be of considerable interest in the future. However, research on the treatment of core symptoms is plagued by limitations in study design, statistical power, and other issues inherent to the study of treatments for autism (e.g., heterogeneity of the disorder) that continue to prevent the elucidation of efficacious treatments.

12196163|t|Biosynthesis of iron-sulphur clusters is a complex and highly conserved process.
12196163|a|Iron-sulphur ([Fe-S]) clusters are simple inorganic prosthetic groups that are contained in a variety of proteins having functions related to electron transfer, gene regulation, environmental sensing and substrate activation. In spite of their simple structures, biological [Fe-S] clusters are not formed spontaneously. Rather, a consortium of highly conserved proteins is required for both the formation of [Fe-S] clusters and their insertion into various protein partners. Among the [Fe-S] cluster biosynthetic proteins are included a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme (NifS) that is involved in the activation of sulphur from l-cysteine, and a molecular scaffold protein (NifU) upon which [Fe-S] cluster precursors are formed. The formation or transfer of [Fe-S] clusters appears to require an electron-transfer step. Another complexity is that molecular chaperones homologous to DnaJ and DnaK are involved in some aspect of the maturation of [Fe-S]-cluster-containing proteins. It appears that the basic biochemical features of [Fe-S] cluster formation are strongly conserved in Nature, since organisms from all three life Kingdoms contain the same consortium of homologous proteins required for [Fe-S] cluster formation that were discovered in the eubacteria.

15474503|t|Effect of pitavastatin on apolipoprotein A-I production in HepG2 cell.
15474503|a|There are few reports describing the mechanism of HDL-elevating action of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). As it is considered that the key step of HDL production is the secretion of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), we investigated the effect of statins on apoA-I synthesis and secretion by HepG2 cell to elucidate the mechanism of the action. Each statin induced apoA-I expression (mRNA and protein) dose-dependently: the rank order of the apoA-I induction pitavastatin (3 microM)>simvastatin (10 microM)>atorvastatin (30 microM). The induction of apoA-I by statins disappeared with addition of mevalonate, which indicates that the effect is HMG-CoA reductase inhibition-dependent. Based on HMG-CoA reductase inhibition, pitavastatin-induced apoA-I more efficiently than simvastatin and atorvastatin. Further study revealed that pitavastatin increased ABCA1 mRNA in HMG-CoA reductase-dependent manner and that Rho and Rho kinase inhibitor (C3T and Y27632) increased apoA-I production in the HepG2 cells. These results suggest that pitavastatin efficiently increases apoA-I in the culture medium of HepG2 cells by promoting apoA-I production through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and suppression of Rho activity and by protecting apoA-I from catabolism through ABCA1 induction and lipidation of apoA-I.

8606397|t|Leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of pulmonary blast injury.
8606397|a|Our previous studies demonstrate a significant increase of sulfidopeptide leukotriene concentrations in animals exposed to a free air blast. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of leukotrienes in the local response of lung tissue as well as in the general response of organisms to blast overpressure. The study was conducted on adult rabbits exposed to moderate blast overpressure (four pulmonary contusions characterized as confluent ecchymoses involving 30 to 60% of the lungs), generated in laboratory conditions. One group of experimental animals was treated with 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitor, diethylcarbamazine (DEC, Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) (50 mg/kg, i.v.), immediately before blast. The early posttraumatic period was observed (30 minutes after blast). Hemodynamic parameters (mean arterial pressure, heart rate, blood gases) as well as arterial plasma levels of conjugated dienes were observed. The myeloperoxidase activity, lipid peroxidation products levels, and water contents were measured in the lung tissue of injured rabbits. We observed that 5-LO inhibition reduced edema formation, accumulation of neutrophils, and generation of lipid peroxidation products in injured lungs. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with DEC inhibits the increased systemic generation of conjugated dienes after blast injury. Although DEC exerts local antioxidant activity with beneficial effects on lung tissue, this 5-LO inhibitor intensifies the blast overpressure caused hemodynamic insufficiency.

8150771|t|Cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
8150771|a|Cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized N-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. Because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria rapidly. In addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. It has good affinity for PBPs 2 and 3 of Escherichia coli and for PBP 3 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Its broad-spectrum of activity includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. It is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC90 for P. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. Other Gram-negative organisms, Haemophilus influenzae, Neiserria meningitidis, Neiserria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. Among Gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. Cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Only strains of P. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. In experimental infections such as meningitis, induced with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.

23512754|t|Effect of the Potent Antiviral 1-Cinnamoyl-3,11-Dihydroxymeliacarpin on Cytokine Production by Murine Macrophages Stimulated with HSV-2.
23512754|a|The limonoid 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM) isolated from leaf extracts of Melia azedarach L, has potent antiherpetic effect in epithelial cells. Since Meliacine, the partially purified extract source of CDM, has therapeutic effect on murine genital herpes, the potential use of CDM as microbicide against herpetic infections was studied here. To determine the cytotoxic effect of CDM, the MTT assay and acridine orange staining of living cells were performed. The antiherpetic action of CDM was measured by plaque reduction assay, and the immunomodulatory effect was determined by measuring the cytokine production using a bioassay and ELISA method. The results presented here showed that CDM inhibited Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2) multiplication in Vero cells but did not affect its replication in macrophages which were not permissive to HSV infection. In macrophages, levels of TNF-a, IFN-g, NO, IL-6 and IL-10 were increased by CDM used alone or in combination with HSV-2. Besides, CDM not only synergized TNF-a production combined with IFN-g, but also prolonged its expression in time. Results indicate that CDM inhibits HSV-2 multiplication in epithelial cells and also increases cytokine production in macrophages, both important actions to the clearance of infecting virus in the mouse vagina.

23311608|t|Diels-Alder mediated controlled release from a poly(ethylene glycol) based hydrogel.
23311608|a|A synthetic amino acid bearing a furan functionality was developed and incorporated into peptide sequences using solid phase synthesis. Peptides expressing the furan moiety were attached to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels through a thermally reversible covalent bond formed by a Diels-Alder reaction. Reactions of thiol and maleimide PEG macromers in an off-stoichiometric Michael addition were performed, such that the maleimide moiety was in excess, to create hydrogel networks with pendant Diels-Alder compatible tethering sites, that is, the maleimide. By making use of the Diels-Alder reaction, it was possible to control the release rate of reversibly bound moieties from the hydrogel by changing the temperature; higher temperatures favor a faster retro-Diels-Alder reaction and, therefore, a faster release from the polymer network. This concept was demonstrated by incorporating a fluorescently labeled furan-RGDS sequence into a hydrogel possessing excess maleimide functionalities and monitoring the subsequent liberation of RGDS at various temperatures, illustrating a Diels-Alder mediated release mechanism. The release profile was quantified at temperatures ranging from physiological (37 oC) to 80 oC. By changing the temperature, varying extents of release were attained over the time course of several days, ranging from 40% release for lower temperatures to complete release for the highest temperature considered. Further confirmation of a reaction-diffusion controlled release mechanism was obtained through comparison of experimental release data to a reaction-diffusion model of the release. In addition to thermal modulation, tuning of the release rate was accomplished by altering the number of possible Diels-Alder tethering sites present in the hydrogel. Increasing the amount of free maleimide and, therefore, the number of potential Diels-Alder reaction sites, effectively slowed the release of peptide from the polymer. For instance, doubling the amount of maleimide sites present in the hydrogel system decreased the amount of peptide released from approximately 60% to about 40% in the same span of time.

23564313|t|Vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells is mediated by Ras homologous A protein (Rho A) via mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms.
23564313|a|Despite the availability of melanoma treatment at the primary site, the recurrence of local melanoma can metastasize to any distant organ. Currently, the available therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma are of limited benefit. Thus, the functional analysis of conventional therapies may help to improve their efficiency in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. In the present study, the exposure of melanoma cells to vinblastine was found to trigger apoptosis as evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of both cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor, activation of caspase-9 and 3, and cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose)-Polymerase. Also, vinblastine enhances the phosphorylation of Ras homologous protein A, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, the release of intracellular Ca(2+), as well as the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-jun-N-terminal kinase, p38, inhibitor of kappaBa (IkBa) kinase, and inositol requiring enzyme 1a. In addition, vinblastine induces the DNA-binding activities of the transcription factor NF-kB, HSF1, AP-1, and ATF-2, together with the expression of HSP70 and Bax proteins. Moreover, inhibitory experiments addressed a central role for Rho A in the regulation of vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells via mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms. In conclusion, the present study addresses for the first time a central role for Rho A in the modulation of vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells and thereby provides an insight into the molecular action of vinblastine in melanoma treatment.

23201337|t|Reduced plasma oxytocin levels in female patients with borderline personality disorder.
23201337|a|The neuropeptide oxytocin is involved in social cognition and interaction across species and plays a crucial role in the regulation of affiliative behaviors. Oxytocin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but also in plasma or urine, have been shown to be negatively associated with childhood traumata, aggressive behavior, and suicide attempts. Recently, an altered activity of the oxytocin system has been discussed to play a prominent role in borderline personality disorder (BPD), which is thought to be closely related to traumatic experiences in childhood and is characterized by (para)suicidal behaviors as well as aggressive outbursts. In the present study, we compared plasma oxytocin levels of women with and without BPD in the follicular phase and assessed the relationship between oxytocin concentrations and childhood traumata. Women diagnosed with BPD had significantly reduced oxytocin concentrations, even after controlling for estrogen, progesterone, and contraceptive intake. In addition, plasma oxytocin correlated negatively with experiences of childhood traumata, in particular with emotional neglect and abuse. The results of mediation analyses do not support a model of oxytocin being a prominent mediator in the link between childhood trauma and BPD. Thus, the findings indicate dysregulations in the oxytocin system of patients diagnosed with BPD with more longitudinal research being necessary to disentangle the relationship between childhood adversities, oxytocin system, and psychopathology.

23238657|t|Acute Macrovascular Dysfunction in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Induced by Ingestion of Advanced Glycated b-Lactoglobulins.
23238657|a|OBJECTIVE Recent evidence indicates that heat-enhanced food advanced glycation end products (AGEs) adversely affect vascular function. The aim of this study was to examine the acute effects of an oral load of heat-treated, AGE-modified b-lactoglobulins (AGE-BLG) compared with heat-treated, nonglycated BLG (C-BLG) on vascular function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a double-blind, controlled, randomized, crossover study, 19 patients with T2DM received, on two different occasions, beverages containing either AGE-BLG or C-BLG. We measured macrovascular [brachial ultrasound of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)] and microvascular (laser-Doppler measurements of reactive hyperemia in the hand) functions at baseline (T0), 90 (T90), and 180 (T180) min. RESULTS Following the AGE-BLG, FMD decreased at T90 by 80% from baseline and remained decreased by 42% at T180 (P < 0.05 vs. baseline, P < 0.05 vs. C-BLG at T90). By comparison, following C-BLG, FMD decreased by 27% at T90 and 51% at T180 (P < 0.05 vs. baseline at T180). A significant decrease in nitrite (T180) and nitrate (T90 and T180), as well as a significant increase in N(e)-carboxymethyllisine, accompanied intake of AGE-BLG. There was no change in microvascular function caused by either beverage. CONCLUSIONS In patients with T2DM, acute oral administration of a single AGE-modified protein class significantly though transiently impaired macrovascular function in concert with decreased nitric oxide bioavailability. These AGE-related changes were independent of heat treatment.

11474486|t|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor subtype-specific regulation of hepatic and peripheral gene expression in the Zucker diabetic fatty rat.
11474486|a|Fibrates and thiazolidinediones are used clinically to treat hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia, respectively. Fibrates bind to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, and thiazolidinediones are ligands of PPAR-gamma. These intracellular receptors form heterodimers with retinoid X receptor to modulate gene transcription. To elucidate the target genes regulated by these compounds, we treated Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF) for 15 days with a PPAR-alpha-specific compound, fenofibrate, a PPAR-gamma-specific ligand, rosiglitazone, and a PPAR-alpha/-gamma coagonist, GW2331, and measured the levels of several messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in liver by real-time polymerase chain reaction. All 3 compounds decreased serum glucose and triglyceride levels. Fenofibrate and GW2331 induced expression of acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) oxidase and enoyl-CoA hydratase and reduced apolipoprotein C-III and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNAs. Rosiglitazone modestly increased apolipoprotein C-III mRNA and had no effect on expression of the other 2 genes in the liver but increased the expression of glucose transporter 4 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in adipose tissue. We identified a novel target in liver, mitogen-activated phosphokinase phosphatase 1, whose down-regulation by PPAR-alpha agonists may improve insulin sensitivity in that tissue by prolonging insulin responses. The results of these studies suggest that activation of PPAR-alpha as well as PPAR-gamma in therapy for type 2 diabetes will enhance glucose and triglyceride control by combining actions in hepatic and peripheral tissues.

7959748|t|Murine chromosomal location of the mu and kappa opioid receptor genes.
7959748|a|Opioid receptors are the membrane proteins that mediate the pain-relieving effect of opioid drugs, such as morphine and fentanyl as well as endogenous opioid peptides enkephalins and endorphins. Using cDNAs for the mu and the kappa opioid receptors, we mapped the chromosomal locations of their genes in mouse. Multilocus cross analysis located the mu receptor gene Oprm on Chr 10 and the kappa receptor gene Oprk1 on Chr 1. Both genes are near centromere, with no markers more centromeric. These data indicate that the two opioid receptors are different gene products, ruling out the possibility that they may be differential splicing products from the same gene.

12957216|t|Zuclopenthixol facilitates memory retrieval in rats: possible involvement of noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms.
12957216|a|Although disturbed memory function often coexists with psychosis, the cognitive effects of antipsychotic medications with diverse pharmacodynamic properties are rarely investigated. The neurocognitive profile of zuclopenthixol, a thioxanthene dopaminergic antagonist and a conventional neuroleptic agent, has yet to be investigated despite the effect of the drug on a variety of neurotransmitter systems involved in mediation of learning and memory processes. In this study, the effect of zuclopenthixol was tested on memory retrieval 24 h after training using an inhibitory avoidance task in rats. Acute administration of zuclopenthixol (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg i.p.) before retrieval testing increased step-through latency during the test session. The same doses of zuclopenthixol did not affect the ambulatory activity of rats in the openfield test and therefore the facilitatory effect of the drug on memory function could not be confounded with any motoric properties. This study also investigated the effect of zuclopenthixol on cortical and hippocampal monoaminergic neurotransmitters' levels together with acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) activity, both of which are known to be important in control of cognitive function. Administration of zuclopenthixol (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg i.p.) neither affected dopamine (DA) level nor AChE activity in rat cortex and hippocampus. On the other hand, the lower dose of zuclopenthixol elevated cortical norepinephrine (NE) level, while the higher dose elevated both cortical and hippocampal NE level together with hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) level. These results may suggest the involvement of adrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms in the facilitatory effect of zuclopenthixol on retrieval memory. Zuclopenthixol may therefore be a better alternative than other commonly used antipsychotic medications reported to impair cognitive function of schizophrenic patients.

12881227|t|NHE3 inhibition activates duodenal bicarbonate secretion in the rat.
12881227|a|We examined the effect of inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) on duodenal bicarbonate secretion (DBS) in rats to further understand DBS regulation. DBS was measured by using the pH-stat method and by using CO2-sensitive electrodes. 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (50 microM; DMA), a concentration that selectively inhibits the NHE isoforms NHE1 and NHE2, but not NHE3, did not affect DBS. Nevertheless, 3 mM DMA, a higher concentration that inhibits NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3, significantly increased DBS. Moreover, S1611 and S3226, both specific inhibitors of NHE3 only, or perfusion with Na+-free solutions, dose dependently increased DBS, as measured by pH-stat and CO2-sensitive electrode, without affecting intracellular pH. Coperfusion with 0.1 microM indomethacin, 0.5 mM DIDS, or 1 mM methazolamide did not affect S3226-induced DBS. Nevertheless, coperfusion with 0.1 and 0.3 mM 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid, which inhibits the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor regulator (CFTR), dose dependently inhibited S3226-induced DBS. In conclusion, only specific apical NHE3 inhibition increased DBS, whereas prostaglandin synthesis, Na+-HCO3- cotransporter activation, or intracellular HCO3- formation by carbonic anhydrase was not involved. Because NHE3 inhibition-increased DBS was inhibited by an anion channel inhibitor and because reciprocal CFTR regulation has been previously shown between NHE3 and apical membrane anion transporters, we speculate that NHE3 inhibition increased DBS by altering anion transporter function.

15030294|t|AT1-receptor antagonism in hypertension: what has been learned with irbesartan?
15030294|a|Irbesartan is a long-acting angiotensin II antagonist acting specifically at the level of the Type 1-receptor subtype (AT1-receptor). This compound lowers blood pressure dose-dependently in hypertensive patients and has a placebo-like tolerability. The antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan is greatly enhanced by the coadministration of a diuretic, and fixed-dose combinations of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are now available. Irbesartan-based treatment appears especially effective for high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes, renal disease and cardiac hypertrophy. In patients with Type 2 diabetes, irbesartan delays the development of nephropathy as well as the progression of renal failure. Irbesartan may have antiatherosclerotic properties beyond those expected from blood pressure lowering per se: this AT1-blocker decreases the vascular oxidative stress and prevents the procoagulant as well as the pro-inflammatory effects of angiotensin II. Irbesartan given alone or in combination with a diuretic therefore represents a rational approach to treat hypertensive patients.

11562773|t|Binding site of amiloride to urokinase plasminogen activator depends on species.
11562773|a|A novel drug candidate is checked on its potency on animal models before it can advance to human phase of the research. Usually negative results on animal phase disqualify it. Targeting specific enzymes by small chemicals raises the question about the appropriateness of this approach. As an example, the urokinase (uPA) is recognized as an important enzyme responsible for cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. It is therefore important to ask the question if a small chemical will inhibit uPA of different species with the same or different potency. Using DNA sequence and known structure of uPA we have modeled 3D structures of uPAs for several different species. By theoretical calculations we have determined most probable structure of amiloride/uPAs complexes. Catalytic triad (B57, B102, B195) and specificity pocket (B187-B197, B212-B229) are highly conserved in all cases, and are the regions responsible for proteolytic activity and recognition of the substrate. Significant differences were observed in a different region (loop B93-B101), that we identified as binding site of amiloride to the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Although tPA shares the same function of activating plasminogen and it is structurally similar to uPA. Amiloride is a specific inhibitor of uPA but does not inhibit tPA. Our study shows that predicted position of amiloride depends on species and in some cases was located, as expected, in the specificity pocket, but in the other cases close to the loop B93-B101. This location could weaken affinity of binding or prevent inhibition of uPA. Therefore, drug screening and elimination process based solely on animal study, without careful structural analysis, could lead to the elimination of potential drugs for humans.

23391485|t|Effect of low dose Bisphenol A on the early differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into mammary epithelial cells.
23391485|a|It has been previously reported that Bisphenol A (BPA) can disturb the development of mammary structure and increase the risk of breast cancer in experimental animals. In this study, an in vitro model of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation into mammary epithelial cells was applied to investigate the effect of low dose BPA on the early stages of mammogenesis. A newly established hESC line was directionally differentiated into mammary epithelial cells by a well-established three-dimensional (3D) culture system. The differentiated mammary epithelial cells were characterized by immunofluorescence and western blotting assay, and were called induced differentiated mammary epithelial cells (iDMECs) based on these data. The hESCs were treated with low doses of BPA range 10(-9)-10(-6)M during the differentiation process, with DMSO as the solvent control and 17-b-estrodiol (E2) as the estrogen-positive control. Our results showed that low dose BPA and E2 could influence the mammosphere area of iDMECs and upregulate the expression level of Oct4 and Nanog proteins, while only BPA could downregulate the expression of E-cadherin protein. Taken together, this study provides some insights into the effects of low dose BPA on the early differentiation stage of mammary epithelial cells and suggests an easier canceration status of iDMECs under the effect of low dose BPA during its early differentiation stage.

19708854|t|Vapreotide: a somatostatin analog for the treatment of acute variceal bleeding.
19708854|a|BACKGROUND: Portal hypertension is a clinically important consequence of cirrhosis that can lead to morbidities such as variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites. All of these outcomes carry high mortality rates. There have been several drugs created to assist with endoscopic therapy for the treatment of acute variceal bleeding. Recently, vapreotide has been studied in patients to evaluate its efficacy as treatment for acute variceal hemorrhage. Although no comparisons have been made between vapreotide and other somatostatin analogues, this drug has been shown to have efficacy in the control of acute variceal bleeding as well as reducing the risk of recurrent bleeding and death, especially when started prior to endoscopy. OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the literature regarding the basic science and clinical efficacy of vapreotide in acute variceal bleeding. METHODS: We used a PubMed/Medline search in order to review the literature regarding the drug, vapreotide. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Vapreotide appears to have benefit in the control of acute variceal bleeding. It is easy to administer and has few side effects, which are minor. These findings endorse the need for future trials to evaluate vapreotide and its use in acute variceal hemorrhage, a morbidity among patients with cirrhosis.

15704203|t|Safety and tolerability of denufosol tetrasodium inhalation solution, a novel P2Y2 receptor agonist: results of a phase 1/phase 2 multicenter study in mild to moderate cystic fibrosis.
15704203|a|Denufosol tetrasodium (INS37217) is a selective P2Y(2) agonist that stimulates ciliary beat frequency and Cl(-) secretion in normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelia, and is being investigated as an inhaled treatment for CF. The Cl(-) secretory response is mediated via a non-CFTR pathway, and the driving force for Cl(-) secretion is enhanced by the effect of P2Y(2) activation to also inhibit epithelial Na(+) transport. Denufosol is metabolically more stable and better tolerated, and may enhance mucociliary clearance for a longer period of time than previously investigated P2Y(2) agonists. The goal of this phase 1/phase 2 study was to assess the safety and tolerability of single and repeated doses of aerosolized denufosol in subjects with CF. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter comparison of ascending single doses of denufosol (10, 20, 40, and 60 mg, administered by inhalation via the Pari LC Star nebulizer) vs. placebo (normal saline), followed by a comparison of twice-daily administration of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of denufosol or placebo for 5 days. Thirty-seven adult (18 years of age or older) and 24 pediatric (5-17 years of age) subjects with CF were evaluated in five cohorts. Subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either denufosol or placebo within each cohort. The percent of subjects experiencing adverse events was similar between the denufosol and placebo groups. The most common adverse event in subjects receiving denufosol was chest tightness in adult subjects (39%) and cough in pediatric subjects (56%). Three (7%) subjects receiving denufosol and one (7%) subject receiving placebo experienced a serious adverse event. Forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) profiles following dosing were similar across treatment groups, with some acute, reversible decline seen in both groups, most notably in subjects with lower lung function at baseline. In conclusion, doses up to 60 mg of denufosol inhalation solution were well-tolerated in most subjects. Some intolerability was noted among subjects with lower baseline lung function. Based on the results of this phase 1/phase 2 study, the Therapeutics Development Network (TDN) of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc., recently completed a multicenter, 28-day, phase 2 safety and efficacy clinical trial of denufosol inhalation solution in CF subjects with mild lung disease.

23256446|t|Metabolic effects of honey in type 1 diabetes mellitus: a randomized crossover pilot study.
23256446|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of 12-week honey consumption on patients suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). This was a randomized crossover clinical trial done in the National Institute for Diabetes and Endocrinology, Cairo, Egypt. Twenty patients of both sexes aged 4-18 years with type 1 DM and HbA1C<10% participated in the study. They were randomized into two equal groups (intervention to control and control to intervention). The dietary intervention was 12-week honey consumption in a dose of 0.5 mL/kg body weight per day. The main outcome measures were serum glucose, lipids, and C-peptide, and anthropometric measurements. None of participants were lost in follow-up. The intervention resulted in significant decreases in subscapular skin fold thickness (SSFT; P=.002), fasting serum glucose (FSG; P=.001), total cholesterol (P=.0001), serum triglycerides (TG; P=.0001), and low-density lipoprotein (P=.0009), and significant increases in fasting C-peptide (FCP; P=.0004) and 2-h postprandial C-peptide (PCP; P=.002). As possible long-term effects of honey after its withdrawal, statistically significant reductions in midarm circumference (P=.000), triceps skin fold thickness (P=.006), SSFT (P=.003), FSG (P=.005), 2-h postprandial serum glucose (P=.000), TG (P=.003), and HbA1C (P=.043), and significant increases in FCP (P=.002) and PCP (P=.003) were observed. This small clinical trial suggests that long-term consumption of honey might have positive effects on the metabolic derangements of type 1 DM.

8384716|t|Molecular cloning and functional expression of 5-HT1E-like rat and human 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor genes.
8384716|a|Sequential polymerase chain reaction experiments were performed to amplify a unique sequence representing a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein)-coupled receptor from rat hypothalamic cDNA. Degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved amino acids from transmembrane domains III, V, and VI of known receptors [5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, and 5-HT2; 5-HT is serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine)] were used as primers for the sequential reactions. The resulting product was subcloned and used to screen a rat genomic library to identify a full-length clone (MR77) containing an intronless open reading frame encoding a 366-amino acid seven-transmembrane domain protein. The human homolog was isolated, and its encoded protein had 93% overall amino acid identity with the rat sequence. Within the conserved transmembrane domains, the sequences exhibit approximately 52%, 59%, 65%, and 68% amino acid identity with the known rat 5-HT1A, rat 5-HT1B, rat 5-HT1D, and human 5-HT1E receptors, respectively. MR77 was subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector system and expressed in CosM6 cells. Studies on broken cell preparations indicate that the expressed receptor exhibits 125I-labeled d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) binding that can be displaced by serotonin but not by other biogenic amines. The specific binding is displaced by the selective 5-HT1D agonist sumatriptan but not by the mixed 5-HT1A/1D agonist 5-carboxyamidotryptamine. 125I-labeled LSD binding was competitively antagonized by the ergot alkaloids methysergide and ergotamine. HeLa cells transfected with the MR77 gene exhibited inhibition of adenylate cyclase in response to serotonin. MR77 is expressed at low levels throughout the brain, with the greatest expression in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. MR77 thus represents a 5-HT receptor of the 5-HT1 class, and we propose that, based on the pharmacological characterization, MR77 represents an additional 5-HT1E-like receptor.

23194825|t|Neurotoxicity of "ecstasy" and its metabolites in human dopaminergic differentiated SH-SY5Y cells.
23194825|a|"Ecstasy" (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA) is a widely abused recreational drug, reported to produce neurotoxic effects, both in laboratory animals and in humans. MDMA metabolites can be major contributors for MDMA neurotoxicity. This work studied the neurotoxicity of MDMA and its catechol metabolites, a-methyldopamine (a-MeDA) and N-methyl-a-methyldopamine (N-Me-a-MeDA) in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells differentiated with retinoic acid and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. Differentiation led to SH-SY5Y neurons with higher ability to accumulate dopamine and higher resistance towards dopamine neurotoxicity. MDMA catechol metabolites were neurotoxic to SH-SY5Y neurons, leading to caspase 3-independent cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. MDMA did not show a concentration- and time-dependent death. Pre-treatment with the antioxidant and glutathione precursor, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), resulted in strong protection against the MDMA metabolites' neurotoxicity. Neither the superoxide radical scavenger, tiron, nor the inhibitor of the dopamine (DA) transporter, GBR 12909, prevented the metabolites' toxicity. Cells exposed to a-MeDA showed an increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels, which, at the 48 h time-point, was not dependent in the activity increase of g-glutamylcysteine synthetase (g-GCS), revealing a possible transient effect. Importantly, pre-treatment with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of g-GCS, prevented a-MeDA induced increase in GSH levels, but did not augment this metabolite cytotoxicity. Even so, BSO pre-treatment abolished NAC protective effects against a-MeDA neurotoxicity, which were, at least partially, due to GSH de novo synthesis. Inversely, pre-treatment of cells with BSO augmented N-Me-a-MeDA-induced neurotoxicity, but only slightly affected NAC neuroprotection. In conclusion, MDMA catechol metabolites promote differential toxic effects to differentiated dopaminergic human SH-SY5Y cells.

23246481|t|Wogonin inhibits H2O2-induced vascular permeability through suppressing the phosphorylation of caveolin-1.
23246481|a|Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and b-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.

11585753|t|The tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 ("Iressa") inhibits HER2-driven signaling and suppresses the growth of HER2-overexpressing tumor cells.
11585753|a|The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly overexpressed in many human tumors and provides a new target for anticancer drug development. ZD1839 ("Iressa"), a quinazoline tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for the EGFR, has shown good activity in preclinical studies and in the early phase of clinical trials. However, because it remains unclear which tumor types are the best targets for treatment with this agent, the molecular characteristics that correlate with tumor sensitivity to ZD1839 have been studied. In a panel of human breast cancer and other epithelial tumor cell lines, HER2-overexpressing tumors were particularly sensitive to ZD1839. Growth inhibition of these tumor cell lines was associated with the dephosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, and HER3, accompanied by the loss of association of HER3 with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and down-regulation of Akt activity. These studies suggest that HER2-overexpressing tumors are particularly susceptible to the inhibition of HER family tyrosine kinase signaling and suggest novel strategies to treat these particularly aggressive tumors.

8294418|t|Phorbol esters and norepinephrine destabilize alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells.
8294418|a|The mechanism by which norepinephrine (NE) down-regulates alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor (alpha-AR) mRNA was studied in rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells. NE, phorbol esters, and bradykinin each decreased alpha-AR mRNA levels by 70-80%. The protein kinase C inhibitor (+)-1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7) abolished the effects of phorbol esters and NE and decreased basal mRNA levels by 52 +/- 3%. Neither ryanodine nor EGTA inhibited down-regulation of alpha-AR mRNA by NE. Actinomycin D caused alpha-AR mRNA level to decrease with a half-life of 3.2 +/- 0.4 h and blocked the effect of H-7 to decrease basal alpha-AR mRNA level. Both NE and phorbol esters increased the rate of alpha-AR mRNA degradation. In NE-desensitized cells, phorbol esters and bradykinin each caused the expected down-regulation of alpha-AR mRNA. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid prolonged the normally transient effect of NE for at least 24 h. We conclude that protein kinase C exerts two opposing effects on alpha-AR mRNA levels, 1) a decrease in the stability of the mRNA that requires the sustained phosphorylation of a protein kinase C substrate and 2) a permissive effect on alpha-AR gene transcription.

23638842|t|Protective Role of (RS )-glucoraphanin Bioactivated with Myrosinase in an Experimental Model of Multiple Sclerosis.
23638842|a|AIM: The discovery of new natural compounds with pharmacological properties is a field of interest widely growing. Recent literature shows that Brassica vegetables (Cruciferae) possess therapeutic effects particularly ascribed due to their content in glucosinolates, which upon myrosinase hydrolysis release the corresponding isothiocyanates. This study examines the potential neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects of (RS )-glucoraphanin from Tuscan black kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala sabellica) bioactivated with myrosinase (bioactive RS -GRA) (10 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally), in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis. METHODS: EAE was induced by immunization with myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein peptide (MOG35-55 ) in mice. After immunization, mice were observed daily for signs of EAE and weight loss. Clinical score was evaluated using a standardized scoring system. RESULTS: By Western blot analysis of spinal cord tissues, we have demonstrated that treatment with bioactive RS -GRA significantly decreased nuclear factor (NF)-kB translocation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as interleukin-1b (IL-1b), and apoptosis (Bax and caspase 3 expression). CONCLUSION: Our results clearly demonstrate that bioactive RS -GRA treatment may represent a useful therapeutic perspective in the treatment of this disease.

23432662|t|Discovery of a Novel Selective PPARg Ligand with Partial Agonist Binding Properties by Integrated in Silico/in Vitro Work Flow.
23432662|a|Full agonists to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)g, such as Rosiglitazone, have been associated with a series of undesired side effects, such as weight gain, fluid retention, cardiac hypertrophy, and hepatotoxicity. Nevertheless, PPARg is involved in the expression of genes that control glucose and lipid metabolism and is an important target for drugs against type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease. In an effort to identify novel PPARg ligands with an improved pharmacological profile, emphasis has shifted to selective ligands with partial agonist binding properties. Toward this end we applied an integrated in silico/in vitro workflow, based on pharmacophore- and structure-based virtual screening of the ZINC library, coupled with competitive binding and transactivation assays, and adipocyte differentiation and gene expression studies. Hit compound 9 was identified as the most potent ligand (IC50 = 0.3 uM) and a relatively poor inducer of adipocyte differentiation. The binding mode of compound 9 was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation, and the calculated free energy of binding was -8.4 kcal/mol. A novel functional group, the carbonitrile group, was identified to be a key substituent in the ligand-protein interactions. Further studies on the transcriptional regulation properties of compound 9 revealed a gene regulatory profile that was to a large extent unique, however functionally closer to that of a partial agonist.

22391562|t|A potent Chk1 inhibitor is selectively cytotoxic in melanomas with high levels of replicative stress.
22391562|a|There are few effective treatments for metastatic melanoma. Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibitors are being trialled for their efficacy in enhancing conventional chemotherapeutic agents, but their effectiveness as single agents is not known. We have examined the effectiveness of two novel Chk1 selective inhibitors, AR323 and AR678, in a panel of melanoma cell lines and normal cell types. We demonstrate that these drugs display single-agent activity, with IC50s in the low nanomolar range. The drugs produce cytotoxic effects in cell lines that are most sensitive to these drugs, whereas normal cells are only sensitive to these drugs at the higher concentrations where they have cytostatic activity. The cytotoxic effect is the consequence of inhibition of S-phase Chk1, which drives cells prematurely from late S phase into an aberrant mitosis and results in either failure of cytokinesis or cell death through an apoptotic mechanism. The sensitivity to the Chk1 inhibitors was correlated with the level of endogenous DNA damage indicating replicative stress. Chk1 inhibitors are viable single-agent therapies that target melanoma cells with high levels of endogenous DNA damage. This sensitivity suggests that Chk1 is a critical component of an adaptation to replicative stress in these cells. It also suggests that markers of DNA damage may be useful in identifying the melanomas and potentially other tumour types that are more likely to be sensitive to Chk1 inhibitors as single agents.

16220064|t|A review of the structural and functional features of olmesartan medoxomil, an angiotensin receptor blocker.
16220064|a|The angiotensin II (A-II) type 1 (AT1) receptor-mediated effects of A-II play a key role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Effective inhibition of A-II is provided by the latest class of antihypertensive medications, the AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs). These orally available agents were developed around a common imidazole-based structural core. The most recent member of this drug class to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, olmesartan medoxomil, contains unique features that may explain its clinical efficacy. Key structural elements of olmesartan medoxomil include a hydroxyalkyl substituent at the imidazole 4-position and a hydrolyzable ester group at the imidazole 5-position. Inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding involving these groups may contribute to the potentiation of antagonist activity. After oral administration, olmesartan medoxomil is deesterified in the intestinal tract to produce the active metabolite olmesartan, which undergoes no additional metabolic change. The marked antihypertensive efficacy of olmesartan medoxomil may result from a unique pharmacological interaction of the drug with the AT1 receptor, resulting in a potent, long-lasting, dose-dependent blockade of A-II. This review article characterizes the structural features of olmesartan that may be responsible for its clinical efficacy. Inferential pharmacological studies compare and contrast the effects of olmesartan to those of other ARBs in comparable preclinical animal models.

17081103|t|Glutathione peroxidases and redox-regulated transcription factors.
17081103|a|Analysis of the selenoproteome identified five glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) in mammals: cytosolic GPx (cGPx, GPx1), phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx (PHGPX, GPx4), plasma GPx (pGPX, GPx3), gastrointestinal GPx (GI-GPx, GPx2) and, in humans, GPx6, which is restricted to the olfactory system. GPxs reduce hydroperoxides to the corresponding alcohols by means of glutathione (GSH). They have long been considered to only act as antioxidant enzymes. Increasing evidence, however, suggests that nature has not created redundant GPxs just to detoxify hydroperoxides. cGPx clearly acts as an antioxidant, as convincingly demonstrated in GPx1-knockout mice. PHGPx specifically interferes with NF-kappaB activation by interleukin-1, reduces leukotriene and prostanoid biosynthesis, prevents COX-2 expression, and is indispensable for sperm maturation and embryogenesis. GI-GPx, which is not exclusively expressed in the gastrointestinal system, is upregulated in colon and skin cancers and in certain cultured cancer cells. GI-GPx is a target for Nrf2, and thus is part of the adaptive response by itself, while PHGPx might prevent cancer by interfering with inflammatory pathways. In conclusion, cGPx, PHGPx and GI-GPx have distinct roles, particularly in cellular defence mechanisms. Redox sensing and redox regulation of metabolic events have become attractive paradigms to unravel the specific and in part still enigmatic roles of GPxs.

23123250|t|A combination of [+] and [-]-Huperzine A improves protection against soman toxicity compared to [+]-Huperzine A in guinea pigs.
23123250|a|The neuropathologic mechanisms after exposure to lethal doses of nerve agent are complex and involve multiple biochemical pathways. Effective treatment requires drugs that can simultaneously protect by reversible binding to the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and blocking cascades of seizure related brain damage, inflammation, neuronal degeneration as well as promoting induction of neuroregeneration. [-]-Huperzine A ([-]-Hup A), is a naturally occurring potent reversible AChE inhibitor that penetrates the blood-brain barrier. It also has several neuroprotective effects including modification of beta-amyloid peptide, reduction of oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and induction and regulation of nerve growth factor. Toxicities at higher doses restrict the neuroporotective ability of [-]-Hup A for treatment. The synthetic stereoisomer, [+]-Hup A, is less toxic due to poor AChE inhibition and is suitable for both pre-/post-exposure treatments of nerve agent toxicity. [+]-Hup A block the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizure in rats, reduce excitatory amino acid induced neurotoxicity and also prevent soman induced toxicity with minimum performance decrement. Unique combinations of two stereo-isomers of Hup A may provide an excellent pre/post-treatment drug for the nerve agent induced seizure/status epilepticus. We investigated a combination of [+]-Hup A with a small dose of [-]-Hup A ([+] and [-]-Hup A) against soman toxicity. Our data showed that pretreatment with a combination [+] and [-]-Hup A significantly increased the survival rate and reduced behavioral abnormalities after exposure to 1.2xLD50 soman compared to [+]-Hup A in guinea pigs. In addition, [+] and [-]-Hup A pretreatment inhibited the development of high power of EEG better than [+]-Hup A pretreatment alone. These data suggest that a combination of [+] and [-]-Hup A offers better protection than [+]-Hup A and serves as a potent medical countermeasure against lethal dose nerve agent toxicity in guinea pigs.

15191400|t|Auranofin increases apoptosis and ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the rat isolated heart.
15191400|a|Auranofin, an antirheumatic gold compound, is an inhibitor of selenocysteine enzymes, such as thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase. These enzymes play an important role in protecting cardiac tissue from oxidative stress generated during ischaemia-reperfusion. Auranofin (100 mg/kg) was administered to rats and their hearts were subjected to an in vitro model of ischaemia-reperfusion. The activity of thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase was determined in liver and heart tissues in an attempt to correlate enzymatic activity with heart recovery after ischaemia-reperfusion. There was significantly less thioredoxin reductase activity in rat liver extracts, whereas the level of glutathione activity remained unchanged, demonstrating that the dose of auranofin used was able to selectively inhibit one of these enzyme systems. Rats administered auranofin displayed significantly impaired recovery from ischaemic insult. The end diastolic pressure was increased, whereas the rate pressure product was significantly decreased. The level of postischaemic apoptosis was also assessed by examining caspase-3 activity in tissue homogenates. Auranofin significantly increased the degree of postischaemic apoptosis, leading to poor postischaemic recovery.

17013809|t|The evolution of progesterone receptor ligands.
17013809|a|Progesterone is one of the first nuclear receptor hormones to be described functionally and subsequently approached as a drug target. Because progesterone (1) affects both menstruation and gestation via the progesterone receptor (PR), research aimed at modulating its activity is usually surrounded by controversy. However, ligands for PR were developed into drugs, and their evolution can be crudely divided into three periods: (1) drug-like steroids that mimic the gestational properties of progesterone; (2) drug-like steroids with different properties from progesterone and expanded therapeutic applications; and (3) non-steroidal PR ligands with improved selectivity and modulator properties and further expanded therapeutic applications. Although the latter have yet to see widespread clinical applications, their development is founded on a half century of research, and they represent the future for this drug target.

23044488|t|Amino acid residues at the N- and C-termini are essential for the folding of active human butyrylcholinesterase polypeptide.
23044488|a|Human serum butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) is currently the most suitable bioscavenger for the prophylaxis of highly toxic organophosphate (OP) nerve agents. A dose of 200mg of HuBChE is envisioned as a prophylactic treatment that can protect humans from an exposure of up to 2xLD50 of soman. The limited availability and administration of multiple doses of this stoichiometric bioscavenger make this pretreatment difficult. Thus, the goal of this study was to produce a smaller enzymatically active HuBChE polypeptide (HBP) that could bind to nerve agents with high affinity thereby reducing the dose of enzyme. Studies have indicated that the three-dimensional structure and the domains of HuBChE (acyl pocket, lip of the active center gorge, and the anionic substrate-binding domain) that are critical for the binding of substrate are also essential for the selectivity and binding of inhibitors including OPs. Therefore, we designed three HBPs by deleting some N- and C-terminal residues of HuBChE by maintaining the folds of the active site core that includes the three active site residues (S198, E325, and H438). HBP-4 that lacks 45 residues from C-terminus but known to have BChE activity was used as a control. The cDNAs for the HBPs containing signal sequences were synthesized, cloned into different mammalian expression vectors, and recombinant polypeptides were transiently expressed in different cell lines. No BChE activity was detected in the culture media of cells transfected with any of the newly designed HBPs, and the inactive polypeptides remained inside the cells. Only enzymatically active HBP-4 was secreted into the culture medium. These results suggest that residues at the N- and C-termini are required for the folding and/or maintenance of HBP into an active stable, conformation.

19429089|t|Inhibitory effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the vesicular monoamine transporter 2.
19429089|a|The neuronal vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) is the target molecule of action of some psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). The present study examined the effect of antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), on VMAT2 activity by measuring adenosine triphosphate-dependent [(3)H]dopamine uptake into synaptic vesicles prepared from rat striatum. SSRIs, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine, inhibited vesicular [(3)H]dopamine uptake in vitro. The rank order of potency was reserpine>>fluoxetine, paroxetine>fluvoxamine, methamphetamine>MDMA. Moreover, kinetic analysis revealed that inhibition by reserpine, a typical VMAT2 inhibitor, was uncompetitive, decreasing maximum velocity and affinity for dopamine. Inhibition by fluoxetine was noncompetitive, only decreasing maximum velocity for dopamine. These results suggest that fluoxetine inhibited the activity of VMAT2 by a mechanism different from that of reserpine and did not directly interact with the active site of VMAT2.

9891987|t|Various glucocorticoids differ in their ability to induce gene expression, apoptosis and to repress NF-kappaB-dependent transcription.
9891987|a|Glucocorticoids (GCs) influence a great variety of cellular functions by at least three important modes of action: the activation (or repression) of genes controlled by binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes and the recently discovered cross-talk to other transcription factors such as NF-kappaB. In this study we systematically compared various natural and synthetic steroid hormones frequently used as therapeutic agents on their ability to mediate these three modes of action. Betamethasone, triamcinolone, dexamethasone and clobetasol turned out to be the best inducers of gene expression and apoptosis. All GCs including the antagonistic compound RU486 efficiently reduced NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation to comparable extents, suggesting that ligand-induced nuclear localization of the GR is sufficient for transrepression. Glucocorticoid treatment of cells did not result in elevated IkappaB-alpha expression, but impaired the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced degradation of IkappaB-alpha without affecting DNA binding of NF-kappaB. The structural requirements for the various functions of glucocorticoids are discussed.

15498586|t|An angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist, telmisartan augments glucose uptake and GLUT4 protein expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
15498586|a|Evidence has accumulated that some of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonists have insulin-sensitizing property. We thus examined the effect of telmisartan on insulin action using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. With standard differentiation inducers, a higher dose of telmisartan effectively facilitated differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Treatment of both differentiating adipocytes and fully differentiated adipocytes with telmisartan caused a dose-dependent increase in mRNA levels for PPARgamma target genes such as aP2 and adiponectin. By contrast, telmisartan attenuated 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 mRNA level in differentiated adipocytes. Of note, we demonstrated for the first time that telmisartan augmented GLUT4 protein expression and 2-deoxy glucose uptake both in basal and insulin-stimulated state of adipocytes, which may contribute, at least partly, to its insulin-sensitizing ability.

19399743|t|Successful liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria treated with the anti-complement antibody eculizumab.
19399743|a|Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired hemolytic anemia caused by somatic mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan-complementation class A gene and the resulting absence of a key complement regulatory protein, CD59. Affected red blood cells in patients with PNH undergo intravascular complement-mediated lysis with resulting anemia, hemoglobinuria, and venous thromboses. Hepatic venous outflow thrombosis [Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS)] is especially common in PNH patients and often fatal. The few case reports of outcomes in patients undergoing liver transplant for BCS secondary to PNH detail instances of recurrent BCS as well as early thrombotic portal vein occlusion and hepatic artery thrombosis requiring retransplantation. PNH is therefore generally considered a contraindication to liver transplantation. Here we present the first report of a patient with PNH and BCS undergoing successful liver transplantation while receiving eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the activation of the terminal complement at C5.

16343532|t|Crystal structures of protein phosphatase-1 bound to motuporin and dihydromicrocystin-LA: elucidation of the mechanism of enzyme inhibition by cyanobacterial toxins.
16343532|a|The microcystins and nodularins are tumour promoting hepatotoxins that are responsible for global adverse human health effects and wildlife fatalities in countries where drinking water supplies contain cyanobacteria. The toxins function by inhibiting broad specificity Ser/Thr protein phosphatases in the host cells, thereby disrupting signal transduction pathways. A previous crystal structure of a microcystin bound to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1c) showed distinct changes in the active site region when compared with protein phosphatase-1 structures bound to other toxins. We have elucidated the crystal structures of the cyanotoxins, motuporin (nodularin-V) and dihydromicrocystin-LA bound to human protein phosphatase-1c (gamma isoform). The atomic structures of these complexes reveal the structural basis for inhibition of protein phosphatases by these toxins. Comparisons of the structures of the cyanobacterial toxin:phosphatase complexes explain the biochemical mechanism by which microcystins but not nodularins permanently modify their protein phosphatase targets by covalent addition to an active site cysteine residue.

10742288|t|Characterization of human recombinant alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors expressed in Chinese hamster lung cells using extracellular acidification rate changes.
10742288|a|1. Human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) fibroblasts have been characterized pharmacologically using a cytosensor microphysiometer to measure ligand-induced extracellular acidification rate changes. 2. In untransfected CHL cells, noradrenaline had no effect at concentrations up to 100 microM. In alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor transfected cells the rank order of agonist potency was A-54741 (mean pEC(50)=8.96)>dexmedetomidine (8.88)>UK-14304 (8.42)>B-HT 920 (7.05)>noradrenaline (6.92). A-54741, UK-14304 and noradrenaline had the same maximum response while dexmedetomidine and B-HT 920 behaved as partial agonists. 3. The selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor ligand rauwolscine antagonized acidification rate changes with an affinity independent of the agonist used; the affinity (mean pK(B)) against noradrenaline was 8.43. 4. The selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor ligands prazosin and doxazosin (each 3 microM) had no effect on noradrenaline responses. 5. Acidification rate changes induced by each agonist were abolished by pre-treatment of cells with pertussis toxin. 6. These data suggest that agonist-induced acidification rate responses in CHL cells transfected with the human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor are mediated exclusively by the recombinant protein, via pertussis toxin sensitive G(i/o) proteins.

23150495|t|Ablation of Egr2-positive cells in male mouse anterior pituitary leads to atypical isolated GH deficiency.
23150495|a|In this study, we have investigated the expression and function of the transcription factor early growth response factor 2 (Egr2)/Krox20 in the developing anterior pituitary. Egr2 is initially expressed in all differentiating hormonal cells types, but its expression is mostly restricted to the somatotroph lineage after birth. Egr2 knockout results in anterior pituitary hypoplasia. However, the analysis of a conditional mutant demonstrates that this phenotype does not originate from a lack of Egr2 expression in the pituitary. Using an Egr2 allele driving a Cre-activable toxin gene, we performed a genetic ablation of Egr2-positive cells in the pituitary. During the postnatal period, this ablation leads to specific and progressive depletion of the somatotroph population, creating a novel model of early-onset isolated GH deficiency (GHD). Mutant animals were subjected to a complete metabolic analysis, revealing atypical and expected features. Consistent with an adult-onset isolated GHD model, mutant animals are hypoglycemic and display increased insulin sensitivity and glucose clearance. This latter phenotype is in contrast to the glucose intolerance observed in another early-onset GHD model. Surprisingly, increased insulin sensitivity is not accompanied by a modified balance between fat and lean tissues, but by reduced metabolic adaptability between glucose and lipid oxidation conditions. This suggests that the relationship between these metabolic features and insulin sensitivity should be reconsidered. In conclusion, our mutant may be a valuable genetic model with which to study the effects of long-term GH deficiency, in conditions of normal pancreatic function and unaffected balance between fat and glucose metabolism.

23494802|t|Curcuminoids Modulate Pro-Oxidant-Antioxidant Balance but not the Immune Response to Heat Shock Protein 27 and Oxidized LDL in Obese Individuals.
23494802|a|Curcuminoids have potentially important functional qualities including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial, the effects of a curcuminoid supplement on serum pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) and antibody titres to Hsp27 (anti-Hsp27) and oxLDL (anti-oxLDL) were investigated. Thirty obese individuals were randomized to receive either curcuminoids (1 g/day) or placebo for a period of 30 days. After a wash-out period of 2 weeks, subjects were crossed over to the alternate regimen for another 30 days. Serum PAB along with anti-Hsp27 and anti-oxLDL titres was measured at the beginning and at the end of each study period. There was no significant carry-over effect for any of the assessed parameters. Curcuminoid supplementation was associated with a significant decrease in PAB (p = 0.044). However, no significant change was observed in serum concentrations of anti-Hsp27 or anti-oxLDL (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that oral curcuminoids supplementation (1g/day) is effective in reducing oxidative stress burden, though this needs to be validated in larger study populations.

23322769|t|Genome-wide screen for modulation of hepatic apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) secretion.
23322769|a|Control of plasma cholesterol levels is a major therapeutic strategy for management of coronary artery disease (CAD). Although reducing LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) levels decreases morbidity and mortality, this therapeutic intervention only translates into a 25-40% reduction in cardiovascular events. Epidemiological studies have shown that a high LDL-c level is not the only risk factor for CAD; low HDL cholesterol (HDL-c) is an independent risk factor for CAD. Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is the major protein component of HDL-c that mediates reverse cholesterol transport from tissues to the liver for excretion. Therefore, increasing ApoA-I levels is an attractive strategy for HDL-c elevation. Using genome-wide siRNA screening, targets that regulate hepatocyte ApoA-I secretion were identified through transfection of 21,789 siRNAs into hepatocytes whereby cell supernatants were assayed for ApoA-I. Approximately 800 genes were identified and triaged using a convergence of information, including genetic associations with HDL-c levels, tissue-specific gene expression, druggability assessments, and pathway analysis. Fifty-nine genes were selected for reconfirmation; 40 genes were confirmed. Here we describe the siRNA screening strategy, assay implementation and validation, data triaging, and example genes of interest. The genes of interest include known and novel genes encoding secreted enzymes, proteases, G-protein-coupled receptors, metabolic enzymes, ion transporters, and proteins of unknown function. Repression of farnesyltransferase (FNTA) by siRNA and the enzyme inhibitor manumycin A caused elevation of ApoA-I secretion from hepatocytes and from transgenic mice expressing hApoA-I and cholesterol ester transfer protein transgenes. In total, this work underscores the power of functional genetic assessment to identify new therapeutic targets.

17935273|t|Sunitinib, sorafenib and mTOR inhibitors in renal cancer.
17935273|a|Understanding the alterations in cellular protein interactions and their relations to genetic mutations that cause renal cell carcinoma (RCC) provides a unique opportunity for the development of disease-specific therapy for patients with advanced forms of this disease. There is substantial evidence of an association between mutation on von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene and the earliest stages of tumorigenesis of RCC. The main consequence of VHL loss is the upregulation of downstream proangiogenic factors leading to highly vascular tumors. Overexpression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is also caused by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key component of signaling pathways inside the cell, involved in cell proliferation. The inhibition of proangiogenic factors and mTOR was the main idea behind the development of new targeted agents in advanced RCC. Since December 2005, 3 targeted agents have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced RCC: sorafenib, sunitinib and temsirolimus. Sorafenib and sunitinib are synthetic, orally active agents shown to directly inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptors -2 and -3 (VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-beta), while temsirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor. Recent clinical studies form the basis for new guidelines for the treatment of advanced RCC: sorafenib should be used as a second-line treatment, sunitinib as the first-line therapy for good and intermediate-risk patients, and temsirolimus should be considered as first-line treatment for poor-risk patients. Future approaches to targeted therapy should focus on optimizing the use of current active drugs, exploring their combinations or investigating their sequential use. In addition, it is important to define the mechanisms of resistance on their use and to further investigate biomarkers and enhance treatment efficacy for the individual patients. The development of these targeted therapies represents an exciting step forward in the treatment of advanced RCC.

23628605|t|Steroid hormone synthesis in mitochondria.
23628605|a|Mitochondria are essential sites for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Mitochondria in the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal, gonad, placenta and brain contain the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc, and its two electron-transfer partners, ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. This enzyme system converts cholesterol to pregnenolone and determines net steroidogenic capacity, so that it serves as the chronic regulator of steroidogenesis. Several other steroidogenic enzymes, including 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11b-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase also reside in mitochondria. Similarly, the mitochondria of renal tubular cells contain two key enzymes participating in the activation and degradation of vitamin D. The access of cholesterol to the mitochondria is regulated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, StAR, serving as the acute regulator of steroidogenesis. StAR action requires a complex multi-component molecular machine on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Components of this machine include the 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO), the voltage-dependent anion chanel (VDAC-1), TSPO-associated protein 7 (PAP7, ACBD3), and protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1a (PKAR1A). The precise fashion in which these proteins interact and move cholesterol from the OMM to P450scc, and the means by which cholesterol is loaded into the OMM, remain unclear. Human deficiency diseases have been described for StAR and for all the mitochondrial steroidogenic enzymes, but not for the electron transfer proteins or for the components of the cholesterol import machine.

23623750|t|Molecular and functional characterization of flavin-containing monooxygenases in cynomolgus macaque.
23623750|a|Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs), drug-metabolizing enzymes essential for the metabolism of endogenous biochemicals and foreign compounds, have been characterized in human (including FMO1-5 and FMO6P), but remain to be investigated in cynomolgus macaque. In this study, cDNAs of cynomolgus FMO1-5 and FMO6 were isolated and characterized. Amino acid sequences of cynomolgus FMO1-5, respectively, shared high sequence identities (94-98%) and were closely clustered in a phylogenetic tree, with human FMO1-5. Eight different transcripts, due to alternative splicing, were isolated for cynomolgus FMO6, which is highly identical ( 96%) to human FMO6P. Among the 10 tissue types analyzed, cynomolgus FMO1, FMO2, FMO4, and FMO6 were most abundantly expressed in kidney, while cynomolgus FMO3 and FMO5 were most abundantly expressed in liver. In kidney and liver, the most abundantly expressed cynomolgus FMO genes were FMO1 and FMO3 respectively. Cynomolgus FMO1, FMO2, FMO3, and FMO5 metabolized benzydamine, and FMO1/FMO3 and FMO3 also metabolized methimazole and trimethylamine, respectively. Rates of benzydamine N-oxygenation (catalyzed by FMO3) varied (approximately 20-fold) among the 28 cynomolgus livers and were significantly correlated with FMO3 protein expression, indicating that the inter-animal variations in benzydamine N-oxygenation might be partly accounted for by the variable FMO3 expression. Cynomolgus FMO6 metabolized benzydamine only slightly, but minimal expression of FMO6 in all tissue precludes the importance of FMO6 in drug metabolism, unlike cynomolgus FMO1, FMO2, FMO3, and FMO5 which were all functional. Abundant expression of FMO1 and FMO3 in kidney and liver, respectively, suggest their importance in drug metabolism in cynomolgus macaque, similar to human.

7837275|t|Conformational transitions linked to active site ligation in human thrombin: effect on the interaction with fibrinogen and the cleavable platelet receptor.
7837275|a|An experimental strategy based on solution viscosity perturbation allowed us to study the energetics of amide-substrates, p-aminobenzamidine (p-ABZ) and proflavin binding to the catalytic site of two proteolyzed forms of alpha-thrombin, i.e. zeta- and gamma T-thrombin. These thrombin derivatives are cleaved at the Leu144-Gly150 loop and at the fibrinogen recognition exosite (FRS), respectively. A phenomenological analysis of thermodynamic data showed that the amide substrates and p-ABZ interactions with zeta-thrombin were respectively, associated with a chemical compensation (i.e. the linear relationship between entropy and enthalpy of binding) and a hydrophobic phenomenon (i.e. a change in the standard heat capacity). The latter was slightly lower than that previously observed for a alpha-thrombin (0.78 +/- 0.25 versus 1.01 +/- 0.17 kcal/mol K). Both phenomenon were absent in gamma T-thrombin. The interaction of a alpha-, zeta- and gamma T-thrombin with macromolecular substrates that "bridge-bind" to both the catalytic site (CS) and fibrinogen recognition exosite (FRS), such as fibrinogen and the cleavable platelet receptor (CPR), was also evaluated. These interactions were studied by following fibrinopeptide A (FpA) release and by measuring intraplatelet Ca2+ changes induced by thrombin-CPR interaction. It was found that the free energy of activation (RT ln Kcat/Km) for both fibrinogen and CPR hydrolysis followed the same hierarchy, i.e. alpha > zeta > gamma. Moreover, the values of delta Cp for alpha-, zeta- and gamma T-thrombin interaction with p-ABZ were found to be linearly correlated to the free energy of activation for both fibrinogen and CPR cleavage. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that: (1) the Leu144-Gly150 loop and the FRS are both involved in the conformational transition linked to the binding of p-aminobenzamidine to the thrombin active site; (2) the extent of thrombin's capacity to undergo conformational transitions in alpha-, zeta- and gamma T forms is positively correlated to the free energy of activation for hydrolysis of macromolecular substrates interacting with both the catalytic domain and the FRS.

23349489|t|b-Cells Are Not Generated in Pancreatic Duct Ligation-Induced Injury in Adult Mice.
23349489|a|The existence of adult b-cell progenitors remains the most controversial developmental biology topic in diabetes research. It has been reported that b-cell progenitors can be activated by ductal ligation-induced injury of adult mouse pancreas and apparently act in a cell-autonomous manner to double the functional b-cell mass within a week by differentiation and proliferation. Here, we demonstrate that pancreatic duct ligation (PDL) does not activate progenitors to contribute to b-cell mass expansion. Rather, PDL stimulates massive pancreatic injury, which alters pancreatic composition and thus complicates accurate measurement of b-cell content via traditional morphometry methodologies that superficially sample the pancreas. To overcome this potential bias, we quantified b-cells from the entire pancreas and observed that b-cell mass and insulin content are totally unchanged by PDL-induced injury. Lineage-tracing studies using sequential administration of thymidine analogs, rat insulin 2 promoter-driven cre-lox, and low-frequency ubiquitous cre-lox reveal that PDL does not convert progenitors to the b-cell lineage. Thus, we conclude that b-cells are not generated in injured adult mouse pancreas.

16417577|t|Galanin attenuates cyclic AMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation induced by chronic morphine and naloxone challenge in Cath.a cells and primary striatal cultures.
16417577|a|Repeated morphine administration leads to molecular alterations of the neural circuitry in the locus coeruleus and nucleus accumbens. These changes include increased activity of several components of the cAMP signaling pathway that are thought to be associated with psychological and somatic signs of opiate withdrawal. The neuropeptide galanin has been shown to attenuate cAMP signaling in multiple cell types. The current study demonstrates that acute galanin treatment blocks the consequences of increased cAMP signaling following chronic opiate administration and withdrawal in Cath.a cells and primary cultures of striatal neurons as measured by phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB). In addition, galanin-mediated attenuation of CREB phosphorylation is independent of galanin-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation in Cath.a cells. These data suggest that galanin receptors may serve as an additional potential therapeutic target for the treatment of opiate withdrawal.

15732037|t|Carvedilol modulates the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor in a rat model of volume-overload heart failure.
15732037|a|BACKGROUND: The use of beta-blockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment for congestive heart failure. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. However, the expression of HIF-1alpha in chronic heart failure resulting from volume overload and after treatment with beta-blocker is little known. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that HIF-1alpha plays a role in the failing myocardium because of volume overload, an aorta-caval shunt was created for 4 weeks in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce volume-overload heart failure. Carvedilol at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. The heart weight and body weight ratio increased from 2.6 +/- 0.3 in the sham group to 3.9 +/- 0.7 (P < .001) in the shunt group. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased from 6.5 +/- 0.5 mm to 8.7 +/- 0.6 mm (P < .001). Treatment with carvedilol in the shunt group reversed the heart weight and ventricular dimension to the baseline values. Western blot showed that HIF-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) proteins were upregulated and nerve growth factor-beta (NGF-beta) downregulated in the shunt group. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP increased and mRNA of NGF-beta decreased in the shunt group. Treatment with carvedilol reversed both protein and mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNP, and NGF-beta to the baseline values. Increased immunohistochemical labeling of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the shunt group and carvedilol again normalized the labeling. CONCLUSION: HIF-1alpha and VEGF mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in the rat model of volume-overload heart failure. Treatment with carvedilol is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation of HIF-1alpha and VEGF in the failing ventricular myocardium.

23600432|t|5-Lipoxygenase inhibitors: a review of recent patents (2010 - 2012).
23600432|a|Introduction: 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) is a crucial enzyme of the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade and catalyzes the formation of bioactive leukotrienes (LTs) with the help of FLAP, the 5-LO-activating protein. LTs are inflammatory mediators playing a pathophysiological role in different diseases like asthma, allergic rhinitis as well as cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. With the rising number of indications for anti-LT therapy, 5-LO inhibitor drug development becomes increasingly important. Areas covered: Here, both recent findings regarding the pathophysiological role of 5-LO and the patents claimed for 5-LO inhibitors are discussed. Focusing on direct inhibitors, several patents disclosing FLAP antagonists are also subject of this review. Novel compounds include 1,5-diarylpyrazoles, indolizines and indoles and several natural product extracts. Expert opinion: Evaluation of the patent activities revealed only quite moderate action. Nevertheless, several auspicious drug-like molecules were disclosed. It seems that in the near future, FLAP inhibitors can be expected to enter the market for the treatment of asthma. With the resolved structure of 5-LO, structure-based drug design is now applicable. Together with the identification of downstream enzyme inhibitors and dual-targeting drugs within the AA cascade, several tools are at hand to cope with 5-LOs increasing pathophysiological roles.

7516184|t|TSG-6, an arthritis-associated hyaluronan binding protein, forms a stable complex with the serum protein inter-alpha-inhibitor.
7516184|a|TSG-6 is a secreted 35-kDa glycoprotein, inducible by TNF and IL-1. The N-terminal portion of TSG-6 shows sequence homology to members of the cartilage link protein family of hyaluronan binding proteins. The C-terminal half of TSG-6 contains a so-called CUB domain, characteristic for developmentally regulated proteins. High levels of TSG-6 protein are found in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and some other arthritic diseases. Here we show that TSG-6 readily formed a complex with a protein present in human, bovine, rabbit, and mouse serum. This complex was stable during SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and in the presence of 8 M urea. The protein that binds TSG-6 was purified from human serum and identified as inter-alpha-inhibitor (I alpha I) by N-terminal microsequencing. Microsequencing of the complex itself revealed the presence of TSG-6 and two of the three polypeptide chains of I alpha I (bikunin and HC2). Experiments with recombinant TSG-6 and I alpha I purified from human serum showed that the TSG-6/I alpha I complex is rapidly formed even in the apparent absence of other proteins at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C. The TSG-6/I alpha I complex was cleaved by chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase, suggesting that cross-linking by chondroitin sulfate is required for the stability of the complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

23118019|t|In vivo and in vitro characterization of naltrindole-derived ligands at the k-opioid receptor.
23118019|a|Accumulating evidence supports a role for k-opioid receptor antagonists in the treatment of mood disorders. Standard k-antagonists have an unusual pharmacodynamic action, with a single injection blocking receptor signaling for several weeks. Here, we have characterized the k-selective properties of two ligands, 5'-(2-aminomethyl) naltrindole (5'-AMN) and N-((Naltrindol-5-yl) methyl) pentanimidamide (5'-MABN), to identify whether modifications of the naltrindole side chain produces short-acting k-antagonists. Opioid receptor binding affinity and activity were assessed using [(3)H]-diprenorphine binding, guanosine-5'-O-(3-[35S]-thio) triphosphate ([(35)S]-GTPgS) binding and isolated guinea-pig ileum. Pharmacodynamic profiles of 5'-AMN and 5'-MABN (1-10 mg/kg) were investigated using the tail-withdrawal assay and diuresis. Efficacy was also determined in depression- and anxiety-related behavioral paradigms in CD-1 mice. Both 5'-AMN and 5'-MABN had high affinity for k-receptors (K (i) 1.36 + 0.98 and 0.27 + 0.08, respectively) and were revealed as potent k-antagonists (pA(2) 7.43 and 8.18, respectively) and u-receptor antagonists (pA(2) 7.62 and 7.85, respectively) in the ileum. Contrary to our hypothesis, in vivo, 5'-AMN and 5'-MABN displayed long-lasting antagonist effects in mice, reducing the antinociceptive actions of U50,488 (10 mg/kg) at 28 and 21 days post-injection, respectively. Interestingly, while 5'-AMN and 5'-MABN were not k-selective, both compounds did show significant antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects at 7-14 days post-injection in mice.

12086935|t|Metformin increases AMP-activated protein kinase activity in skeletal muscle of subjects with type 2 diabetes.
12086935|a|Metformin is an effective hypoglycemic drug that lowers blood glucose concentrations by decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing glucose disposal in skeletal muscle; however, the molecular site of metformin action is not well understood. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity increases in response to depletion of cellular energy stores, and this enzyme has been implicated in the stimulation of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and the inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis. We recently reported that AMPK is activated by metformin in cultured rat hepatocytes, mediating the inhibitory effects of the drug on hepatic glucose production. In the present study, we evaluated whether therapeutic doses of metformin increase AMPK activity in vivo in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Metformin treatment for 10 weeks significantly increased AMPK alpha2 activity in the skeletal muscle, and this was associated with increased phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr172 and decreased acetyl-CoA carboxylase-2 activity. The increase in AMPK alpha2 activity was likely due to a change in muscle energy status because ATP and phosphocreatine concentrations were lower after metformin treatment. Metformin-induced increases in AMPK activity were associated with higher rates of glucose disposal and muscle glycogen concentrations. These findings suggest that the metabolic effects of metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes may be mediated by the activation of AMPK alpha2.

23400747|t|Effects of amlodipine on the oral bioavailability of cephalexin and cefuroxime axetil in healthy volunteers.
23400747|a|In this study, the authors compared the effects of amlodipine (AML) on the bioavailability of cephalexin (LEX) and cefuroxime axetil (CXM). Twenty-four healthy men were randomized to 4 treatments according to a crossover design with a 14-day washout. After an overnight fast, they were administered orally LEX 500 mg alone, LEX 500 mg 2 hours after oral administration of AML 5 mg, CXM 500 mg alone, and CXM 500 mg 2 hours after oral administration of AML 5 mg. All participants completed the whole study without side effects being observed. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed by noncompartmental modeling with WinNonlin software. The geometric mean (GM) ratios were 1.38 (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-1.45) for the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for LEX and 1.27 (1.18-1.36) for the maximum concentration of drug in serum (C(max)) for LEX followed by AML versus alone. In contrast, no significant differences were found in the pharmacokinetic parameters of CXM between treatments (P < .05). They authors conclude that AML possesses an enhancement effect in b-lactam antibiotic bioavailability (in this case, LEX), and this interaction may be specific to the peptidomimetic b-lactam antibiotics.

23538201|t|EZETIMIBE INCREASES HEPATIC IRON LEVELS IN MICE FED A HIGH-FAT DIET.
23538201|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that ezetimibe may be a promising agent for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH). Phlebotomy and dietary iron restriction reduces serum transaminase in NAFLD/NASH patients. Recent studies showed that mutual effects exist between lipid metabolism and iron metabolism. Accordingly, the effects of ezetimibe on iron metabolism were examined in mice fed a high-fat diet with or without iron. C57BL/6 mice were fed the following diets for 12 weeks. Experiment 1:1) a control diet; C 2) C plus ezetimibe (0.3mg/day; 4 weeks); CE 3) a high-fat diet; H 4) H plus ezetimibe; HE. Experiment 2: 1) C containing carbonyl iron (average; 22.4mg/day; 6 weeks); CI 2) CI plus ezetimibe; CIE 3) H containing carbonyl iron; HI 4) HI plus ezetimibe; HIE. Blood, livers, and duodenum were removed after 12 weeks. In Experiment 1, hepatic iron levels were higher in HE than H, whereas there was no difference between C and CE. Hepatic mRNA expression of transferrin receptor 1 and 2, ferritins, and hepcidin were increased more in CE than C, and in HE than H. In duodenum, DMT1, ferritinH, and hephaestin mRNA levels were increased in CE compared to C. In Experiment 2, hepatic iron concentrations were higher in HIE than HI. Hepatic mRNA expression of ferritinL and hepcidin were increased in HIE compared to HI. In duodenum, ferritinL mRNA was increased in HIE compared to CIE. Ezetimibe induced hepatic iron uptake transporter expression in mice fed a high-fat diet, causing increased hepatic iron concentrations.

23419783|t|Metformin and Sulfonylureas in Relation to Cancer Risk in Type II Diabetes Patients: A Meta-analysis using primary data of published studies.
23419783|a|INTRODUCTION: Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyperinsulinemia are at increased risk for developing malignancies. It remains to be fully elucidated whether use of metformin, an insulin sensitizer, and/or sulfonylureas, insulin secretagogues, affect cancer incidence in subjects with T2DM. MATERIAL & METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis using PubMed, of randomized control trials (RCTs), cohorts, and case-control studies published through July 2012 that assess effects of metformin and/or sulfonylurea sulfonylureas on cancer risk at any site, in subjects with T2DM. Fixed and random effects meta-analysis models were used, and the effect size was summarized as relative risk (RR) for RCTs/cohorts and as odds ratio (OR) for the case-control studies. RESULTS: Analysis of 24 metformin studies in subjects with T2DM showed that metformin use is associated with reduced risk for the development of cancer, in both cohort (RR=0.70 [95% CI=0.67-0.73]) and case-control studies (OR=0.90 [95% CI=0.84-0.98]), but this finding was not supported by RCTs (RR=1.01[95% CI=0.81-1.26]). Data from 18 sulfonylurea studies in subjects with T2DM showed that sulfonylurea use is associated with an increase in all-cancer risk, in cohort studies (RR=1.55 [95% CI=1.48 -1.63]), though data from RCTs (RR=1.17 [95% CI=0.95-1.45]) and case-control studies (OR=1.02 [95% CI=0.93-1.13]) failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis using pooled primary data demonstrates that metformin use reduces, while sulfonylurea use may be associated with an increased cancer risk in subjects with T2DM. These findings need to be confirmed in large-scale RCTs before they are translated into clinical practice.

23597506|t|Anandamide deficiency and heightened neuropathic pain in aged mice.
23597506|a|Damaging of peripheral nerves may result in chronic neuropathic pain for which the likelihood is increased in the elderly. We assessed in mice if age-dependent alterations of endocannabinoids contributed to the heightened vulnerability to neuropathic pain at old age. We assessed nociception, endocannabinoids and the therapeutic efficacy of R-flurbiprofen in young and aged mice in the spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain. R-flurbiprofen was used because it is able to reduce neuropathic pain in young mice in part by increasing anandamide. Aged mice developed stronger nociceptive hypersensitivity after sciatic nerve injury than young mice. This was associated with low anandamide levels in the dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, thalamus and cortex, which further decreased after nerve injury. In aged mice, R-flurbiprofen had only weak antinociceptive efficacy and it failed to restore normal anandamide levels after nerve injury. In terms of the mechanisms, we found that fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) which degrades anandamide, was upregulated after nerve injury at both ages, so that this upregulation likely did not account for the age-dependent differences. However, enzymes contributing to oxidative metabolism of anandamide, namely cyclooxygenase-1 and Cyp2D6, were increased in the brain of aged mice, possibly enhancing the oxidative breakdown of anandamide. This may overwhelm the capacity of R-flurbiprofen to restore anandamide homeostasis and may contribute to the heightened risk for neuropathic pain at old age.

17594192|t|Phenserine.
17594192|a|Phenserine, a derivative of physostigmine, was first described as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and was shown to improve cognition in various experimental paradigms in rodents and dogs. It was clinically tested for Alzheimer's disease, with moderate success in initial Phase II studies. Phenserine deserves attention for an additional quality of action: in addition to inhibiting AChE, it modulates the amount of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neuronal cell culture by reducing APP translation. This effect probably involves interaction of phenserine with a regulatory element in the 5'-untranslated region of the APP gene that controls APP expression. Phenserine apparently reduces translational efficiency of APP mRNA into protein, a process that may involve an interaction with iron and/or an iron-responsive element. As a consequence, phenserine reduces beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) formation in vitro and in vivo. Phenserine is also unique because of differing actions of its enantiomers: (-)-phenserine is the active enantiomer for inhibition of AChE, whereas (+)-phenserine ('posiphen') has weak activity as an AChE inhibitor and can be dosed much higher. Both enantiomers are equipotent in downregulating APP expression. (+)-Posiphen may be a promising drug, either alone or in combination with (-)-phenserine, to attenuate the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

23640884|t|Distinct role of PYK2 in mediating thromboxane generation downstream of both G12/13 and integrin aiibb in platelets.
23640884|a|Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) is activated by various agonists in platelets. We evaluated the signaling mechanism and the functional role of Pyk2 in platelets by using pharmacological inhibitors and Pyk2-deficient platelets. We found that platelet aggregation and secretion in response to 2-MeSADP and AYPGKF were diminished in the presence of Pyk2 inhibitors or in Pyk2-deficient platelets, suggesting that Pyk2 plays a positive regulatory role in platelet functional responses. It has been shown that ADP-, but not thrombin-, induced thromboxane (TxA2) generation depends on integrin signaling. Unlike ADP, thrombin activates G12/13 pathways, and G12/13 pathways can substitute for integrin signaling for TxA2 generation. We found that Pyk2 was activated downstream of both G12/13 and integrin-mediated pathways, and both 2-MeSADP- and AYPGKF-induced TxA2 generation was significantly diminished in Pyk2-deficient platelets. In addition, TxA2 generation induced by co-stimulation of Gi and Gz pathways, which is dependent on integrin signaling, was inhibited by blocking Pyk2. Furthermore, inhibition of 2-MeSADP-induced TxA2 generation by fibrinogen receptor antagonist was not rescued by co-stimulation of G12/13 pathways in the presence of Pyk2 inhibitor. We conclude that Pyk2 is a common signaling effector downstream of both G12/13 and integrin aIIbb3 signaling which contributes to thromboxane generation.

23047022|t|Characterisation of acetylcholinesterase release from neuronal cells.
23047022|a|Although acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is primarily a hydrolytic enzyme, metabolising the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses, it also has some non-catalytic functions in the brain which are far less well characterised. AChE was shown to be secreted or shed from the neuronal cell surface like several other membrane proteins, such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Since AChE does not possess a transmembrane domain, its anchorage in the membrane is established via the Proline Rich Membrane Anchor (PRiMA), a transmembrane protein. Both the subunit oligomerisation and membrane anchor of AChE are shared by a related enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), the physiological function of which in the brain is unclear. In this work, we have assayed the relative activities of AChE and BChE in membrane fractions and culture medium of three different neuronal cell lines, namely the neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y and NB7 and the mouse basal forebrain cell line SN56. In an effort to understand the shedding process of AChE, we have used several pharmacological treatments, which showed that it is likely to be mediated in part by an EDTA- and batimastat-sensitive, but GM6001-insensitive metalloprotease, with the possible additional involvement of a thiol isomerase. Cellular release of AChE by SH-SY5Y is significantly enhanced by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonists carbachol or muscarine, with the effect of carbachol blocked by the mAChR antagonist atropine. AChE has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and it has been shown that it accelerates formation and increases toxicity of amyloid fibrils, which have been closely linked to the pathology of AD. In light of this, greater understanding of AChE and BChE physiology may also benefit AD research.

23620256|t|Study of endothelial cell apoptosis using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor cell line with hemodynamic microfluidic chip system.
23620256|a|To better understand how hyperglycemia induces endothelial cell dysfunction under the diabetic conditions, a hemodynamic microfluidic chip system was developed. The system combines a caspase-3-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor cell line which can detect endothelial cell apoptosis in real-time, post-treatment effect and with a limited cell sample, by using a microfluidic chip which can mimic the physiological pulsatile flow profile in the blood vessel. The caspase-3-based FRET biosensor endothelial cell line (HUVEC-C3) can produce a FRET-based sensor protein capable of probing caspase-3 activation. When the endothelial cells undergo apoptosis, the color of the sensor cells changes from green to blue, thus sensing apoptosis. A double-labeling fluorescent technique (yo pro-1 and propidium iodide) was used to validate the findings revealed by the FRET-based caspase sensor. The results show high rates of apoptosis and necrosis of endothelial cells when high glucose concentration was applied in our hemodynamic microfluidic chip combined with an exhaustive pulsatile flow profile. The two apoptosis detection techniques (fluorescent method and FRET biosensor) are comparable; but FRET biosensor offers more advantages such as real-time observation and a convenient operating process to generate more accurate and reliable data. Furthermore, the activation of the FRET biosensor also confirms the endothelial cell apoptosis induced by the abnormal pulsatile shear stress and high glucose concentration is through caspase-3 pathway. A 12% apoptotic rate (nearly a 4-fold increase compared to the static condition) was observed when the endothelial cells were exposed to a high glucose concentration of 20 mM under 2 h exhaustive pulsatile shear stress of 30 dyne cm(-2) and followed with another 10 h normal pulsatile shear stress of 15 dyne cm(-2). Therefore, the most important finding of this study is to develop a novel endothelial cell apoptosis detection method, which combines the microfluidic chip system and FRET biosensor. This finding may provide new insight into how glucose causes endothelial cell dysfunction, which is the major cause of diabetes-derived complications.

10095983|t|New aspects in the management of obesity: operation and the impact of lipase inhibitors.
10095983|a|Obesity is an increasing health problem in most developed countries and its prevalence is also increasing in developing countries. There has been no great success with dietary means and life style modification for permanent weight loss. Various surgical treatment methods for obesity are now available. They are aimed at limiting oral energy intake with or without causing dumping or inducing selective maldigestion and malabsorption. Based on current literature, up to 75% of excess weight is lost by surgical treatment with concomitant disappearance of hyperlipidaemias, type 2 diabetes, hypertension or sleep apnoea. The main indication for operative treatment is morbid obesity (body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2) or severe obesity (body mass index > 35 kg/m2) with comorbidities of obesity. Orlistat is a new inhibitor of pancreatic lipase enzyme. At doses of 120 mg three times per day with meals it results in a 30% reduction in dietary fat absorption, which equals approximately 200 kcal daily energy deficit. In the long term, orlistat has been shown to be more effective than placebo in reducing body weight and serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Orlistat has a lowering effect on serum cholesterol independent of weight loss. Along with weight loss, orlistat also favourably affects blood pressure and glucose and insulin levels in obese individuals and in obese type 2 diabetic patients.

22749842|t|Dual inhibitor of PDE7 and GSK-3-VP1.15 acts as antipsychotic and cognitive enhancer in C57BL/6J mice.
22749842|a|Cognitive deficit is a core of schizophrenia and it is not effectively treated by the available antipsychotic drugs, hence new and more effective therapy is needed. Schizophrenia is considered as a pathway disorder where Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) is important molecular player that regulates multiple cellular cascades. We recently reported synergistic action between phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) as DISC1 interacting proteins. In the current study we characterized behavioural effects of a newly developed compound, VP1.15 that inhibits both PDE7 and GSK-3 with main focus on its antipsychotic and cognitive capacities. VP1.15 reduced ambulation in C57BL/6J mice in a dose-dependent manner (7.5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, respectively) and, hence, lower dose was chosen for the further analysis. VP1.1.5 facilitated pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), reversed amphetamine- but not MK-801-induced PPI deficit. The drug was able to ameliorate the disrupted latent inhibition (LI) induced by the increased number of conditioning trials and reversed amphetamine-induced LI deficit, supporting further its antipsychotic effects. The drug also significantly improved episodic memory in the spatial object recognition test, facilitated working memory in Y-maze and enhanced cued fear memory, but had no effect on executive function in the Puzzle box and contextual fear conditioning. Taken together, VP1.15 elicited antipsychotic effects and also facilitated cognitive domains in mice, suggesting that multitarget drugs, affecting molecular substrates from the same pathway, perhaps could be antipsychotics of new-generation that open a new possibilities in drug discoveries. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.

17015640|t|Licofelone, a balanced inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, reduces inflammation in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis.
17015640|a|Licofelone, a dual anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, may have a better cardiovascular profile that cycloxygenase-2 inhibitors due to cycloxygenase-1 blockade-mediated antithrombotic effect and a better gastrointestinal tolerability. We examined the anti-inflammatory effect of licofelone on atherosclerotic lesions as well as in isolated neutrophils from whole blood of rabbits compared with a selective inhibitor of COX-2, rofecoxib. We also assessed the antithrombotic effect of licofelone in rabbit platelet-rich plasma. For this purpose, 30 rabbits underwent injury of femoral arteries, and they were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg/day licofelone or 5 mg/kg/day rofecoxib or no treatment during 4 weeks with atherogenic diet in all cases. Ten healthy rabbits were used as controls. Neutrophils and platelets were isolated from peripheral blood of rabbits for ex vivo studies. Licofelone reduced intima/media ratio in injured arteries, the macrophages infiltration in the neointimal area, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) gene expression, and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in rabbit atheroma. Moreover, licofelone inhibited COX-2 and 5-LOX protein expression in vascular lesions. Rofecoxib only diminished COX-2 protein expression and MCP-1 gene expression in vascular atheroma. Prostaglandin E(2) in rabbit plasma was attenuated by both drugs. Licofelone almost abolished 5-LOX activity by inhibiting leukotriene B4 generation in rabbit neutrophils and prevented platelet thromboxane B2 production from whole blood. Licofelone reduces neointimal formation and inflammation in an atherosclerotic rabbit model more markedly than rofecoxib. This effect, together with the antiplatelet activity of licofelone, suggests that this drug may have a favorable cardiovascular profile.

16902423|t|ABCA12 is the major harlequin ichthyosis gene.
16902423|a|Harlequin ichthyosis (HI) is the most severe form of autosomal-recessive, congenital ichthyosis. Affected infants have markedly impaired barrier function and are more susceptible to infection. Abnormalities in the localization of epidermal lipids as well as abnormal lamellar granule formation are features of HI skin. Previously, we and others have shown that mutations in the ABCA12 gene encoding an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporter underlie the skin disease HI. In this study, we have sequenced the ABCA12 gene in an additional 14 patients and show that all contain mutations, with the majority being either nonsense substitution or frameshift mutations. Eleven HI patients had bi-allelic ABCA12 mutations, whereas in the remaining three HI patients in this study, ABCA12 mutations were detected on only one allele by sequencing. In addition, the one patient from the previous study where no sequence mutations were detected was screened for heterozygous deletions. A combination of oligonucleotide arrays, multiplex PCR analysis and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping revealed a heterozygous intragenic deletion in exon 8. These mutation data establish ABCA12 as the major HI gene.

10637238|t|Comparison of chemotherapy with chemohormonal therapy as first-line therapy for metastatic, hormone-sensitive breast cancer: An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.
10637238|a|PURPOSE: Although hormonal therapy represents standard therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive disease, many patients receive initial chemotherapy because of the location, bulk, or aggressiveness of their disease. It is uncertain whether simultaneous hormonal therapy provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial E3186 was initiated to explore this question. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive either chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil inverted question markCAF) or chemohormonal therapy (CAF plus tamoxifen and Halotestin inverted question markfluoxymesterone; Pharmacia-Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI inverted question markCAFTH) as front-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, prednisone, and TH as a secondary randomization. RESULTS: The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received CAF and CAFTH were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received chemohormonal therapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER-positive compared with ER-negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for CAF v 29.3 months for CAFTH). CONCLUSION: In patients with potentially hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer, chemohormonal therapy prolongs TTF for ER-positive patients without improving overall survival.

15352500|t|A novel membrane sensor for histamine H1-receptor antagonist "fexofenadine".
15352500|a|The construction and general performance of thirteen new polymeric membrane sensors for the determination of fexofenadine hydrochloride based on its ion exchange with reineckate, tetraphenylborate and tetraiodomercurate have been studied. The effects of membrane composition, type of plasticizer, pH value of sample solution and concentration of the analyte in the sensor internal solution have been thoroughly investigated. The novel sensor based on reineckate exchanger shows a stable, potentiometric response for fexofenadine in the concentration range of 1 x 10(-2) - 2.5 x 10(-6) M at 25 degrees C that is independent of pH in the range of 2.0 - 4.5. The sensor possesses a Nernstian cationic slope of 62.3+/-0.7 mV/concentration decade and a lower detection limit of 1.3 x 10(-6) M with a fast response time of 20 - 40 s. Selectivity coefficients for a number of interfering ions and excipients relative to fexofenadine were investigated. There is negligible interference from almost all studied cations, anions, and pharmaceutical excipients, however, citrizine that has a structure homologous to that of fexofenadine was found to interfere. The determination of fexofenadine in aqueous solution shows an average recovery of 99.83% with a mean relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.5%. Direct potentiometric determination of fexofenadine in tablets gave results that compare favorably with those obtained by standard spectrophotometric methods. Potentiometric titration of fexofenadine with phosphomolybdic acid as a titrant has been monitored with the proposed sensor as an end point indicator electrode.

14656380|t|Enhanced beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) signaling by adeno-associated viral (AAV)-mediated gene transfer.
14656380|a|BACKGROUND: Beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2AR) play important regulatory roles in a variety of cells and organ systems and are important therapeutic targets in the treatment of airway and cardiovascular disease. Prolonged use of beta-agonists results in tolerance secondary to receptor down-regulation resulting in reduced therapeutic efficiency. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the signaling capabilities of the beta2AR expressed by a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector that also included an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene (AAV-beta2AR/EGFP). RESULTS: By epifluorescence microscopy, approximately 40% of infected HEK 293 cells demonstrated EGFP expression. beta2AR density measured with [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) increased either 13- or 77-fold in infected cells compared to mock infected controls depending on the culture conditions used. The [3H]DHA binding was to a single receptor population with a dissociation constant of 0.42 nM, as would be expected for wild-type beta2AR. Agonist competition assays with [3H]DHA showed the following rank order of potency: isoproterenol>epinephrine> norepinephrine, consistent with beta2AR interaction. Isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP levels were 5-fold higher in infected cells compared to controls (314 +/- 43 vs. 63.4 +/- 9.6 nmol/dish; n = 3). Receptor trafficking demonstrated surface expression of beta2AR with vehicle treatment and internalization following isoproterenol treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that HEK 293 cells infected with AAV-beta2AR/EGFP effectively express beta2AR and that increased expression of these receptors results in enhanced beta2AR signaling. This method of gene transfer may provide an important means to enhance function in in vivo systems.

11961111|t|G protein-coupled receptors as direct targets of inhaled anesthetics.
11961111|a|The molecular pharmacology of inhalational anesthetics remains poorly understood. Despite accumulating evidence suggesting that neuronal membrane proteins are potential targets of inhaled anesthetics, most currently favored membrane protein targets lack any direct evidence for anesthetic binding. We report herein the location of the binding site for the inhaled anesthetic halothane at the amino acid residue level of resolution in the ligand binding cavity in a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor, bovine rhodopsin. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching and direct photoaffinity labeling with [(14)C]halothane suggested an interhelical location of halothane with a stoichiometry of 1 (halothane/rhodopsin molar ratio). Radiosequence analysis of [(14)C]halothane-labeled rhodopsin revealed that halothane contacts an amino acid residue (Trp265) lining the ligand binding cavity in the transmembrane core of the receptor. The predicted functional consequence, competition between halothane and the ligand retinal, was shown here by spectroscopy and is known to exist in vivo. These data suggest that competition with endogenous ligands may be a general mechanism of the action of halothane at this large family of signaling proteins.

23535288|t|Aberrant activation of M phase proteins by cell proliferation-evoking carcinogens after 28-day administration in rats.
23535288|a|We have previously reported that hepatocarcinogens increase liver cells expressing p21(Cip1), a G1 checkpoint protein and M phase proteins after 28-day treatment in rats. This study aimed to identify early prediction markers of carcinogens available in many target organs after 28-day treatment in rats. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on Ki-67, p21(Cip1) and M phase proteins [nuclear Cdc2, phospho-Histone H3 (p-Histone H3), Aurora B and heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a)] with carcinogens targeting different organs. Carcinogens targeting thyroid (sulfadimethoxine; SDM), urinary bladder (phenylethyl isothiocyanate), forestomach (butylated hydroxyanisole; BHA), glandular stomach (catechol; CC), and colon (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine and chenodeoxycholic acid) were examined using a non-carcinogenic toxicant (caprolactam) and carcinogens targeting other organs as negative controls. All carcinogens increased Ki-67(+), nuclear Cdc2(+), p-Histone H3(+) or Aurora B(+) carcinogenic target cells, except for both colon carcinogens, which did not increase cell proliferation. On the other hand, p21(Cip1+) cells increased with SDM and CC. HP1a responded only to BHA. Results revealed carcinogens evoking cell proliferation concurrently induced cell cycle arrest at M phase or showing chromosomal instability reflecting aberration in cell cycle regulation, irrespective of target organs, after 28-day treatment. Therefore, M phase proteins may be early prediction markers of carcinogens evoking cell proliferation in many target organs.

23238236|t|Chemical assessment and antioxidant capacity of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) seeds.
23238236|a|Capsicum annuum L. is reported to be the most widely cultivated species. Recently, waste of vegetable processing, like seeds, has been the subject of many studies as an attempt to find new, alternative and cheap resources of bioactive compounds with application in several industries. Despite their chemical, biological and ecological importance, C. annuum seeds are still poorly studied. To improve the knowledge on the metabolic profile of this matrix, a targeted metabolite analysis was performed in "sweet Italian" and "Reus long pairal" pepper seeds. Sterols, triterpenes, organic acids, fatty acids and volatile compounds were determined by different chromatographic methods. The antioxidant activity was assessed against DPPH(.), superoxide and nitric oxide radicals. A concentration-dependent activity was noticed against all radicals. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory capacity was also evaluated, but no effect was found. Data provide evidence of great similarities between "sweet Italian" and "Reus long pairal" pepper seeds. The present study indicates that C. annuum seeds are a potential source of valuable bioactive compounds that could be used in food industry.

10606746|t|Structure of acetylcholinesterase complexed with (-)-galanthamine at 2.3 A resolution.
10606746|a|(-)-Galanthamine (GAL), an alkaloid from the flower, the common snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis), shows anticholinesterase activity. This property has made GAL the target of research as to its effectiveness in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of GAL bound in the active site of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase (TcAChE) to 2.3 A resolution. The inhibitor binds at the base of the active site gorge of TcAChE, interacting with both the choline-binding site (Trp-84) and the acyl-binding pocket (Phe-288, Phe-290). The tertiary amine group of GAL does not interact closely with Trp-84; rather, the double bond of its cyclohexene ring stacks against the indole ring. The tertiary amine appears to make a non-conventional hydrogen bond, via its N-methyl group, to Asp-72, near the top of the gorge. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor makes a strong hydrogen bond (2.7 A) with Glu-199. The relatively tight binding of GAL to TcAChE appears to arise from a number of moderate to weak interactions with the protein, coupled to a low entropy cost for binding due to the rigid nature of the inhibitor.

22989703|t|Comparative antioxidant effects of lycopene, apo-10'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14'-lycopenoic acid in human macrophages exposed to H2O2 and cigarette smoke extract.
22989703|a|Much of the beneficial effects of tomato lycopene in the prevention of chronic diseases has been attributed to its antioxidant properties, which could be mediated by its metabolites and/or oxidation products. However, the biological functions of these lycopene derivatives remain still unknown. In the present study, we evaluated and compared the antioxidant efficacy of the lycopene eccentric cleavage products apo-10'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14'-lycopenoic acid in counteracting the oxidative effects of H(2)O(2) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in THP-1 macrophages. Both apo-10'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14'-lycopenoic acid were able to inhibit spontaneous and H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production in a dose-dependent manner. Such an effect was accompanied by an inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation, by NF-kB inactivation, and by inhibition of hsp-70 and hsp-90 expressions. Both apo-lycopenoic acids also decreased CSE-induced ROS production, 8-OHdG formation and reduced the increase in NOX-4 and COX-2 expressions caused by CSE. However, in both the models of oxidative stress, apo-14'-lycopenoic acid was much more potent as an antioxidant than apo-10'-lycopenoic acid, showing antioxidant properties similar to lycopene. These data strongly suggest that apo-lycopenoic acids, and particularly apo-14'-lycopenoic acid, may mediate some of the antioxidant functions of lycopene in cells.

12167474|t|Toxic, halogenated cysteine S-conjugates and targeting of mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism.
12167474|a|Several haloalkenes are metabolized in part to nephrotoxic cysteine S-conjugates; for example, trichloroethylene and tetrafluoroethylene are converted to S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC) and S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine (TFEC), respectively. Although DCVC-induced toxicity has been investigated since the 1950s, the toxicity of TFEC and other haloalkene-derived cysteine S-conjugates has been studied more recently. Some segments of the US population are exposed to haloalkenes either through drinking water or in the workplace. Therefore, it is important to define the toxicological consequences of such exposures. Most halogenated cysteine S-conjugates are metabolized by cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyases to pyruvate, ammonia, and an alpha-chloroenethiolate (with DCVC) or an alpha-difluoroalkylthiolate (with TFEC) that may eliminate halide to give a thioacyl halide, which reacts with epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues in proteins. Nine mammalian pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-containing enzymes catalyze cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase reactions, including mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mitAspAT), and mitochondrial branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT(m)). Most of the cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyases are syncatalytically inactivated. TFEC-induced toxicity is associated with covalent modification of several mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism. Interestingly, the alpha-ketoglutarate- and branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (KGDHC and BCDHC), but not the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), are susceptible to inactivation. mitAspAT and BCAT(m) may form metabolons with KGDHC and BCDHC, respectively, but no PLP enzyme is known to associate with PDHC. Consequently, we hypothesize that not only do these metabolons facilitate substrate channeling, but they also facilitate toxicant channeling, thereby promoting the inactivation of proximate mitochondrial enzymes and the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction.

19023039|t|Pharmacological characterization of pannexin-1 currents expressed in mammalian cells.
19023039|a|Pannexin (Panx) 1 is a widely expressed protein that shares structural, but not amino acid, homology with gap junction proteins, the connexins. Panx1 does not form gap junctions in mammalian cells, but it may function as a plasma membrane hemichannel. Little is known of the pharmacological properties of panx1 expression in mammalian cells. Here, we identify three variants in the human PANX1 gene. We expressed these variants and mouse Panx1 in mammalian cells and compared Panx1-induced currents. All human Panx1 variants and the mouse Panx1 showed identical protein expression levels, localization patterns, and functional properties, although the frequency of functional expression was species-dependent. Panx1 currents were independent of changes in extracellular or intracellular calcium or phospholipase C transduction. We found compounds that inhibited Panx1 currents with a rank order of potency: carbenoxolone > disodium 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS) approximately disodium 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanato-stilben-2,2'-disulfonate approximately 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid > indanyloxyacetic acid 94 >> probenecid >> flufenamic acid = niflumic acid. Triphosphate nucleotides (ATP, GTP, and UTP) rapidly and reversibly inhibited Panx1 currents via mechanism(s) independent of purine receptors. When Panx1 was coexpressed with purinergic P2X(7) receptor (P2X(7)R), DIDS was found to act as a P2X(7)R antagonist to inhibit ATP-evoked currents, but none of the other compounds inhibited P2X(7)R currents. This is the first detailed pharmacological characterization of Panx1-mediated currents in mammalian cells and sheds new, although contradictory, light on the hypothesis that Panx1 acts as a hemichannel to allow passage of large molecules in response to P2X(7)R activation.

23410126|t|Genome-wide integrated analyses of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer based on high-throughput technology.
23410126|a|The androgen receptor (AR) is a steroid hormone receptor that functions as a ligand-dependent transcriptional factor, which plays a key role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Recent advancement in high throughput technologies including microarrays and deep-sequencing provides unbiased genome-wide knowledge on the AR signaling including datasets for androgen-regulated gene expression and genomic binding sites for AR. In the present review, we will briefly summarize the main features of the AR signaling as well as the individual AR target genes identified by the integration of multiple datasets in prostate cancer. Cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) is also featured as a unique transcriptome method, which particularly determines the androgen-dependent transcription start points in prostate cancer.

23262271|a|The twigs of Cudrania tricuspidata were found to show strong tyrosinase inhibitory activity, and further detailed component analysis resulted in the isolation of a new flavanol glucoside, (2S,3S)-2,3-trans-dihydromorin-7-O-b-d-glucoside (1), plus twenty-seven known compounds (2-28). Their structures were elucidated on the basis of ESI-MS and NMR spectral data. Among the isolated compounds, trans-dihydromorin (8), oxyresveratrol (9), and steppogenin (12) were found to exhibit significant tyrosinase inhibition activities. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship of these isolated compounds was also discussed.

23182954|t|Effects of ozone and fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) on rat system inflammation and cardiac function.
23182954|a|In order to understand the toxic mechanisms of cardiovascular system injuries induced by ambient PM(2.5) and/or ozone, a subacute toxicological animal experiment was designed with exposure twice a week for 3 continuous weeks. Wistar rats were randomly categorized into 8 groups (n=6): 1 control group, 3 groups exposed to fine particulate matters (PM(2.5)) alone at 3 doses (0.2, 0.8, or 3.2 mg/rat), 1 group to ozone (0.81 ppm) alone and 3 groups to ozone plus PM(2.5) at 3 doses (0.2, 0.8, or 3.2 mg/rat). Heart rate (HR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored at approximately 24-h both after the 3rd exposure and the last (6th) exposure, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored at approximately 24-h after the 6th exposure. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation and injuries (CRP, IL-6, LDH, CK), heart oxidative stress (MDA, SOD) and endothelial function (ET-1, VEGF) were analyzed after the 6th exposure. Additionally, myocardial ultrastructural alterations were observed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for histopathological analyses. Results showed that PM(2.5) alone exposure could trigger the significant increase of CRP, MDA, CK, ET-1 and SBP and decrease of heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Ozone alone exposure in rats did not show significant alterations in any indicators. Ozone plus PM(2.5) exposure, however, induced CRP, IL-6, CK, LDH and MDA increase, SOD and HRV decrease significantly in a dose-response way. Meanwhile, abnormal ECG types were monitored in rats exposed to PM(2.5) with and without ozone and obvious myocardial ultrastructural changes were observed by TEM. In conclusion, PM(2.5) alone exposure could cause inflammation, endothelial function and ANS injuries, and ozone potentiated these effects induced by PM(2.5).

21207059|t|N-carbamylglutamate treatment for acute neonatal hyperammonemia in isovaleric acidemia.
21207059|a|Hyperammonemia occurs mainly in patients with branched-chain organic acidemias such as propionic, methylmalonic, and isovaleric acidemias. Its pathophysiological process is mainly via the competitive inhibition of N-acetylglutamate synthetase. Oral carglumic acid (N-carbamylglutamate) administration can correct hyperammonemia in neonates with propionic and methylmalonic acidemias, thus avoiding dialysis therapy. Isovaleric acidemia is an autosomal recessive disease of leucine metabolism due to deficiency of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase. For the first time, we report a neonate with isovaleric acidemia, whose plasma ammonia concentration dropped dramatically after one oral load of carglumic acid. This experience suggests that carglumic acid could be considered for acute hyperammonemia resulting from isovaleric acidemia. However, trials with more patients are needed.

23411263|t|Piceatannol, a potent bioactive stilbene, as major phenolic component in Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
23411263|a|The sim fruit (Rhodomyrtus tomentosa) has long been used in folk medicine to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, and to boost the immune system. The purpose of this work was to determine its phenolic profile and to evaluate the changes of content during maturation, as well as the variations induced by environmental conditions. Using HPLC-ESI-HR-MS, 19 phenolic compounds (PCs) were tentatively characterised and included stilbenes and ellagitannins as major components, followed by anthocyanins, flavonols, and gallic acid. PCs were then further quantified by HPLC-DAD. Piceatannol, a promising health-promoting stilbene component, was the major PC in the fruit with a concentration of 2.3mg/g dry weight at full maturity stage. This concentration is 1000-2000 times higher than that of red grapes, a major source of stilbene in the human diet. During maturation, the contents in piceatannol and other stilbenes, ellagitannins, and flavonols decreased while the anthocyanin content increased. Shade-grown sim fruits showed significantly higher piceatannol levels than sun-exposed fruits. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential of sim, an under-utilised plant species from South-East Asia, as a source of health-promoting fruits.

23164618|t|Supra-normal stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors in the prelimbic cortex blocks behavioral expression of both aversive and rewarding associative memories through a cyclic-AMP-dependent signaling pathway.
23164618|a|Dopamine (DA) receptor transmission through either D(1) or D(2)-like subtypes is involved critically in the processing of emotional information within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However the functional role of specific DA D(1)-like receptor transmission in the expression of emotionally salient associative memories (either aversive or rewarding) is not currently understood. Here we demonstrate that specific activation of DA D(1) receptors in the prelimbic (PLC) division of the mPFC causes a transient block in the behavioral expression of both aversive and rewarding associative memories. We report that intra-PLC microinfusions of a selective D(1) receptor agonist block the spontaneous expression of an associative olfactory fear memory, without altering the stability of the original memory trace. Furthermore, using an unbiased place conditioning procedure (CPP), intra-PLC D(1) receptor activation blocks the spontaneous expression of an associative morphine (5 mg/kg; i.p.) reward memory, while leaving morphine-primed memory expression intact. Interestingly, both intra-PLC D(1)-receptor mediated block of either fear-related or reward-related associative memories were dependent upon downstream cyclic-AMP (cAMP) signaling as both effects were rescued by co-administration of a cAMP signaling inhibitor. The blockade of both rewarding and aversive associative memories is mediated through a D(1)-specific signaling pathway, as neither forms of spontaneous memory expression were blocked by intra-PLC microinfusions of a D(2)-like receptor agonist. Our results demonstrate that the spontaneous expression of either rewarding or aversive emotionally salient memories shares a common, D(1)-receptor mediated substrate within the mPFC.

1911436|t|Analysis of coenzyme binding by human placental 3 beta-hydroxy-5-ene-steroid dehydrogenase and steroid 5----4-ene-isomerase using 5'-[p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl]adenosine, an affinity labeling cofactor analog.
1911436|a|3 beta-Hydroxy-5-ene-steroid dehydrogenase and steroid 5----4-ene-isomerase copurify as a single, homogeneous protein from human placental microsomes. Affinity alkylation with 2 alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone suggests that the dehydrogenase and isomerase substrate steroids bind at different sites on the same protein. However, the coenzyme, NADH, completely abolishes the alkylation of both enzyme activities by the progestin analog [Thomas J .L., Myers R. P., Rosik L. O. and Strickler R. C., J. Steroid Biochem. 36 (1990) 117-123]. Unlike bacterial 3-keto-5-ene-steroid isomerase, the human isomerase reaction is stimulated by diphosphopyridine nucleotides (NADH, NAD+). The affinity labeling nucleotide analog, 5'-[p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl]adenosine (FSA), inactivates the dehydrogenase and isomerase activities at similar rates in an irreversible manner which follows first order kinetics with respect to both time and alkylator concentration (0.2-0.6 mM). FSA is a cofactor site-directed reagent that binds with similar affinity as a competitive inhibitor of NAD+ reduction by dehydrogenase (Ki = 162 microM) or as a stimulator of isomerase (Km = 153 microM). Parallel plots derived from Kitz and Wilson analysis indicate that FSA inactivates the two enzyme activities with equal alkylation efficiency (k3/Ki = 1/slope = 0.51/mol-s for both). The 3 beta-hydroxysteroid substrate, pregnenolone, protects isomerase as well as dehydrogenase from inactivation by FSA. These observations are evidence for a single cofactor binding region which services both enzyme activities.

16618126|t|Lipid specific activation of the murine P4-ATPase Atp8a1 (ATPase II).
16618126|a|The asymmetric transbilayer distribution of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the mammalian plasma membrane and secretory vesicles is maintained, in part, by an ATP-dependent transporter. This aminophospholipid "flippase" selectively transports PS to the cytosolic leaflet of the bilayer and is sensitive to vanadate, Ca(2+), and modification by sulfhydryl reagents. Although the flippase has not been positively identified, a subfamily of P-type ATPases has been proposed to function as transporters of amphipaths, including PS and other phospholipids. A candidate PS flippase ATP8A1 (ATPase II), originally isolated from bovine secretory vesicles, is a member of this subfamily based on sequence homology to the founding member of the subfamily, the yeast protein Drs2, which has been linked to ribosomal assembly, the formation of Golgi-coated vesicles, and the maintenance of PS asymmetry. To determine if ATP8A1 has biochemical characteristics consistent with a PS flippase, a murine homologue of this enzyme was expressed in insect cells and purified. The purified Atp8a1 is inactive in detergent micelles or in micelles containing phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylinositol, is minimally activated by phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and is maximally activated by PS. The selectivity for PS is dependent upon multiple elements of the lipid structure. Similar to the plasma membrane PS transporter, Atp8a1 is activated only by the naturally occurring sn-1,2-glycerol isomer of PS and not the sn-2,3-glycerol stereoisomer. Both flippase and Atp8a1 activities are insensitive to the stereochemistry of the serine headgroup. Most modifications of the PS headgroup structure decrease recognition by the plasma membrane PS flippase. Activation of Atp8a1 is also reduced by these modifications; phosphatidylserine-O-methyl ester, lysophosphatidylserine, glycerophosphoserine, and phosphoserine, which are not transported by the plasma membrane flippase, do not activate Atp8a1. Weakly translocated lipids (PE, phosphatidylhydroxypropionate, and phosphatidylhomoserine) are also weak Atp8a1 activators. However, N-methyl-phosphatidylserine, which is transported by the plasma membrane flippase at a rate equivalent to PS, is incapable of activating Atp8a1 activity. These results indicate that the ATPase activity of the secretory granule Atp8a1 is activated by phospholipids binding to a specific site whose properties (PS selectivity, dependence upon glycerol but not serine, stereochemistry, and vanadate sensitivity) are similar to, but distinct from, the properties of the substrate binding site of the plasma membrane flippase.

17111172|t|Occupancy of dopamine D(1), D (2) and serotonin (2A) receptors in schizophrenic patients treated with flupentixol in comparison with risperidone and haloperidol.
17111172|a|RATIONALE: Flupentixol (FLX) has been used as a neuroleptic for nearly 4 decades. In vitro data show comparable affinity to dopamine D(2), D(1) and 5-HT(2A) receptors and recently, FLX showed to be not inferior to risperidone in schizophrenic patients with predominant negative symptomatology, which was implicated with flupentixol's interaction with 5-HT(2A) and/or D(1) receptors. OBJECTIVES: To assess in vivo receptor occupancy (RO) in patients clinically treated with FLX (n = 13, 5.7 +/- 1.4 mg/day) in comparison with risperidone (RIS, n = 11, 3.6 +/- 1.3 mg/day) and haloperidol (HAL, n = 11, 8.5 +/- 5.5 mg/day). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each patient underwent two PET scans with 3-N-[(11)C]methylspiperone (target: frontal 5-HT(2A)), [(11)C]SCH23390 (striatal D(1)) or [(11)C]raclopride (striatal D(2)). RO was calculated as the percentage reduction of specific binding in comparison with healthy controls. RESULTS: D(2)-RO under FLX was between 50% and 70%, indicating an ED(50) of about 0.7 ng/ml serum. 5-HT(2A) and D(1)-RO was 20 +/- 10% and 20 +/- 5% (mean, SEM). Under HAL, D(1)-RO was 14 +/- 6% and under RIS not significantly different from zero. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to demonstrate a moderate 5-HT(2A) and D(1) occupancy under clinically relevant doses of flupentixol, albeit lower than expected from in vitro data and clearly below saturation. Therefore, if flupentixol's efficacy on negative symptoms is based on its interaction with 5-HT(2A) and/or D(1) receptors, it should be highly dependent on serum concentration and thus on dosage and metabolism. However, these data suggest that mechanisms other than D(1) or 5-HT(2A) antagonism may contribute to flupentixol's efficacy on negative symptoms.

3735252|t|Inhibition of testicular LDH-X from laboratory animals and man by gossypol and its isomers.
3735252|a|The inhibitory effect of (+)-, (-)-, (+/-)-gossypol and (+/-)-gossypol acetic acid upon testicular cytosolic LDH-X was measured in vitro. Gossypol acetic acid (0-100 mumol/l) inhibited LDH-X prepared from the testes of the mouse greater than rabbit greater than human greater than rat greater than hamster. There was no relationship between inhibition and in-vivo antifertility activity. LDH activity measured in vitro in serum of men and hamsters was unaffected by gossypol. Gossypol and its isomers were non-competitive inhibitors of human and hamster LDH-X with respect to the coenzyme NADH, competitive inhibitors of human LDH-X and noncompetitive-competitive inhibitors of hamster LDH-X with respect to the substrate alpha-ketobutyrate. Co-incubation with human serum albumin or poly-L-lysine but not lysine protected human and hamster LDH-X from gossypol.

23625813|t|Glomerular Filtration Rate Equations Overestimate Creatinine Clearance in Older Individuals Enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging: Impact on Renal Drug Dosing.
23625813|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of kidney function estimation equations and to determine the frequency of drug dose discordance in an older population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from community-dwelling volunteers randomly selected from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010. SUBJECTS: A total of 269 men and women with a mean + SD age of 81 + 6 years, mean serum creatinine concentration (Scr ) of 1.1 + 0.4 mg/dl, and mean 24-hour measured creatinine clearance (mClcr ) of 53 + 13 ml/minute. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Kidney function was estimated by using the following equations: Cockcroft-Gault (CG), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI). The performance of each equation was assessed by measuring bias and precision relative to mClcr . Dose calculation errors (discordance) were determined for 10 drugs requiring renal dosage adjustments to avoid toxicity when compared with the dosages approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The CG equation was the least biased estimate of mClcr . The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations were significantly positively biased compared with CG (mean + SD 34 + 20% and 22 + 15%, respectively, p<0.001) and mClcr (29 + 47% and 18 + 40%, respectively, p<0.001). Rounding low Scr values (less than 1.0 mg/dl) up to an arbitrary value of 1.0 mg/dl resulted in CG values (44 + 10 ml/minute) that were significantly lower than mClcr (56 + 12 ml/minute, p<0.001) and CG (56 + 15 ml/minute, p<0.001). The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations had median dose discordance rates of 28.6% and 22.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations significantly overestimated creatinine clearance (mClcr and CG) in elderly individuals. This leads to dose calculation errors for many drugs, particularly in individuals with severe renal impairment. Thus equations estimating glomerular filtration rate should not be substituted in place of the CG equation in older adults for the purpose of renal dosage adjustments. In addition, the common practice of rounding or replacing low Scr values with an arbitrary value of 1.0 mg/dl for use in the CG equation should be avoided. Additional studies that evaluate alternative eGFR equations in the older populations that incorporate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes measures are needed.

20801130|t|A structural and functional perspective into the mechanism of Ca2+-sensitizers that target the cardiac troponin complex.
20801130|a|The Ca(2+) dependent interaction between troponin I (cTnI) and troponin C (cTnC) triggers contraction in heart muscle. Heart failure is characterized by a decrease in cardiac output, and compounds that increase the sensitivity of cardiac muscle to Ca(2+) have therapeutic potential. The Ca(2+)-sensitizer, levosimendan, targets cTnC; however, detailed understanding of its mechanism has been obscured by its instability. In order to understand how this class of positive inotropes function, we investigated the mode of action of two fluorine containing novel analogs of levosimendan; 2',4'-difluoro(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yloxy acetic acid (dfbp-o) and 2',4'-difluoro(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yl acetic acid (dfbp). The affinities of dfbp and dfbp-o for the regulatory domain of cTnC were measured in the absence and presence of cTnI by NMR spectroscopy, and dfbp-o was found to bind more strongly than dfbp. Dfbp-o also increased the affinity of cTnI for cTnC. Dfbp-o increased the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of demembranated cardiac trabeculae in a manner similar to levosimendan. The high resolution NMR solution structure of the cTnC-cTnI-dfbp-o ternary complex showed that dfbp-o bound at the hydrophobic interface formed by cTnC and cTnI making critical interactions with residues such as Arg147 of cTnI. In the absence of cTnI, docking localized dfbp-o to the same position in the hydrophobic groove of cTnC. The structural and functional data reveal that the levosimendan class of Ca(2+)-sensitizers work by binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC and stabilizing the pivotal cTnC-cTnI regulatory unit via a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in contrast to the destabilizing effects of antagonists such as W7 at the same interface.

22865292|a|Vacuolar H(+) -ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme located at the ruffled border and in lysosomes of osteoclasts, is necessary for bone resorption. We previously showed that heterozygous mice with an R740S mutation in the a3 subunit of V-ATPase (+/R740S) have mild osteopetrosis resulting from an  90% reduction in proton translocation across osteoclast membranes. Here we show that lysosomal pH is also higher in +/R740S compared with wild-type (+/+) osteoclasts. Both osteoclast number and size were decreased in cultures of +/R740S compared with +/+ bone marrow cells, with concomitant decreased expression of key osteoclast markers (TRAP, cathepsin K, OSCAR, DC-STAMP, and NFATc1), suggesting that low lysosomal pH plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of this inhibition, NFATc1 activation was assessed. NFATc1 nuclear translocation was significantly reduced in +/R740S compared with +/+ cells; however, this was not because of impaired enzymatic activity of calcineurin, the phosphatase responsible for NFATc1 dephosphorylation. Protein and RNA expression levels of regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), an endogenous inhibitor of NFATc1 activation and a protein degraded in lysosomes, were not significantly different between +/R740S and +/+ osteoclasts, but the RCAN1/NFATc1 ratio was significantly higher in +/R740S versus +/+ cells. The lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine significantly increased RCAN1 accumulation in +/+ cells, consistent with the hypothesis that higher lysosomal pH impairs RCAN1 degradation, leading to a higher RCAN1/NFATc1 ratio and consequently NFATc1 inhibition. Our data indicate that increased lysosomal pH in osteoclasts leads to decreased NFATc1 signaling and nuclear translocation, resulting in a cell autonomous impairment of osteoclastogenesis in vitro.

14600253|t|Mechanisms of cefadroxil uptake in the choroid plexus: studies in wild-type and PEPT2 knockout mice.
14600253|a|The choroid plexus uptake of [(3)H]cefadroxil was studied in peptide transporter 2 (PEPT2) wild-type and null mice as a function of temperature, transport inhibitors, pH, and saturability. At normal pH (7.4) and temperature (37 degrees C), the uptake of 1 microM cefadroxil was reduced by 83% in PEPT2(-/-) mice as compared with PEPT2(+/+) mice (p < 0.001). A further reduction was achieved in null animals by reducing the temperature to 4 degrees C, or by adding saturating concentrations of unlabeled cefadroxil or p-aminohippurate (p < 0.05). Glycylsarcosine coadministration could inhibit the uptake of cefadroxil in PEPT2(+/+) mice (p < 0.01) but not PEPT2(-/-) mice. Although a proton-stimulated uptake of cefadroxil was demonstrated in PEPT2(+/+) mice (pH 6.5 versus pH 7.4; p < 0.01), no pH dependence was observed in PEPT2(-/-) mice. Kinetic parameters for cefadroxil (without p-aminohippurate) in wild-type mice were: V(max) = 5.4 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 34 microM, and K(d) = 0.0069 microl/mg/min; in the presence of p-aminohippurate, the parameters were: V(max) = 4.1 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 27 microM, and K(d) = 0.0064 microl/mg/min. In null animals, the kinetic parameters of cefadroxil (without p-aminohippurate) were: V(max) = 2.7 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 110 microM, and K(d) = 0.0084 microl/mg/min; in the presence of p-aminohippurate, only a K(d) = 0.010 microl/mg/min was observed. Based on kinetic and inhibitor analyses, it was determined that (under linear conditions), 80 to 85% of cefadroxil's uptake in choroid plexus is mediated by PEPT2, 10 to 15% by organic anion transporter(s), and 5% by nonspecific mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that PEPT2 is the primary transporter responsible for cefadroxil uptake in the choroid plexus. Moreover, the data suggest a role for PEPT2 in the clearance of peptidomimetics from cerebrospinal fluid.

12070353|t|A molecular mechanism of action of theophylline: Induction of histone deacetylase activity to decrease inflammatory gene expression.
12070353|a|The molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory action of theophylline is currently unknown, but low-dose theophylline is an effective add-on therapy to corticosteroids in controlling asthma. Corticosteroids act, at least in part, by recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to the site of active inflammatory gene transcription. They thereby inhibit the acetylation of core histones that is necessary for inflammatory gene transcription. We show both in vitro and in vivo that low-dose theophylline enhances HDAC activity in epithelial cells and macrophages. This increased HDAC activity is then available for corticosteroid recruitment and predicts a cooperative interaction between corticosteroids and theophylline. This mechanism occurs at therapeutic concentrations of theophylline and is dissociated from phosphodiesterase inhibition (the mechanism of bronchodilation) or the blockade of adenosine receptors, which are partially responsible for its side effects. Thus we have shown that low-dose theophylline exerts an anti-asthma effect through increasing activation of HDAC which is subsequently recruited by corticosteroids to suppress inflammatory genes.

11970990|t|Alefacept, an immunomodulatory recombinant LFA-3/IgG1 fusion protein, induces CD16 signaling and CD2/CD16-dependent apoptosis of CD2(+) cells.
11970990|a|Alefacept, an immunomodulatory recombinant fusion protein composed of the first extracellular domain of LFA-3 fused to the human IgG1 hinge, C(H)2, and C(H)3 domains, has recently been shown in phase II and III clinical trials to safely reduce disease expression in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Alefacept modulates the function of and selectively induces apoptosis of CD2(+) human memory-effector T cells in vivo. We have sought to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of action that influence the biological activity of alefacept and may contribute to its efficacy and patient responsiveness. Specifically evaluated is the ability of alefacept to activate intracellular signals mediated via CD2 and/or Fc gamma RIII (CD16). Experimentation using isoforms of alefacept engineered to have amino acid substitutions in the IgG1 C(H)2 domain that impact Fc gamma R binding indicate that alefacept mediates cognate interactions between cells expressing human CD2 and CD16 to activate cells, e.g., increase extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, up-regulate cell surface expression of the activation marker CD25, and induce release of granzyme B. In the systems used, this signaling is shown to require binding to CD2 and CD16 and be mediated through CD16, but not CD2. Experimentation using human CD2-transgenic mice and isoforms of alefacept confirmed the requirement for Fc gamma R binding for detection of the pharmacological effects of alefacept in vivo. Thus alefacept acts as an effector molecule, mediating cognate interactions to activate Fc gamma R(+) cells (e.g., NK cells) to induce apoptosis of sensitive CD2(+) target cells.

23382379|t|Mammalian myosin-18A, a highly divergent myosin.
23382379|a|The Mus musculus myosin-18A gene is expressed as two alternatively spliced isoforms, a and b, with reported roles in Golgi localization, in maintenance of cytoskeleton, and as receptors for immunological surfactant proteins. Both myosin-18A isoforms feature a myosin motor domain, a single predicted IQ motif, and a long coiled-coil reminiscent of myosin-2. The myosin-18Aa isoform, additionally, has an N-terminal PDZ domain. Recombinant heavy meromyosin- and subfragment-1 (S1)-like constructs for both myosin-18Aa and -18b species were purified from the baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system. These constructs bound both essential and regulatory light chains, indicating an additional noncanonical light chain binding site in the neck. Myosin-18Aa-S1 and -18Ab-S1 molecules bound actin weakly with Kd values of 4.9 and 54 um, respectively. The actin binding data could be modeled by assuming an equilibrium between two myosin conformations, a competent and an incompetent form to bind actin. Actin binding was unchanged by presence of nucleotide. Both myosin-18A isoforms bound N-methylanthraniloyl-nucleotides, but the rate of ATP hydrolysis was very slow (<0.002 s(-1)) and not significantly enhanced by actin. Phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain had no effect on ATP hydrolysis, and neither did the addition of tropomyosin or of GOLPH3, a myosin-18A binding partner. Electron microscopy of myosin-18A-S1 showed that the lever is strongly angled with respect to the long axis of the motor domain, suggesting a pre-power stroke conformation regardless of the presence of ATP. These data lead us to conclude that myosin-18A does not operate as a traditional molecular motor in cells.

23179966|t|Serotonin-glutamate and serotonin-dopamine reciprocal interactions as putative molecular targets for novel antipsychotic treatments: from receptor heterodimers to postsynaptic scaffolding and effector proteins.
23179966|a|The physical and functional interactions between serotonin-glutamate and serotonin-dopamine signaling have been suggested to be involved in psychosis pathophysiology and are supposed to be relevant for antipsychotic treatment. Type II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors have been reported to form heterodimers that modulate G-protein-mediated intracellular signaling differentially compared to mGluR2 and 5-HT(2A) homomers. Additionally, direct evidence has been provided that D(2) and 5-HT(2A) receptors form physical heterocomplexes which exert a functional cross-talk, as demonstrated by studies on hallucinogen-induced signaling. Moving from receptors to postsynaptic density (PSD) scenario, the scaffolding protein PSD-95 is known to interact with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), D(2) and 5-HT(2) receptors, regulating their activation state. Homer1a, the inducible member of the Homer family of PSD proteins that is implicated in glutamatergic signal transduction, is induced in striatum by antipsychotics with high dopamine receptor affinity and in the cortex by antipsychotics with mixed serotonergic/dopaminergic profile. Signaling molecules, such as Akt and glycogen-synthase-kinase-3 (GSK-3), could be involved in the mechanism of action of antipsychotics, targeting dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate neurotransmission. Altogether, these proteins stand at the crossroad of glutamate-dopamine-serotonin signaling pathways and may be considered as valuable molecular targets for current and new antipsychotics. The aim of this review is to provide a critical appraisal on serotonin-glutamate and serotonin-dopamine interplay to support the idea that next generation schizophrenia pharmacotherapy should not exclusively rely on receptor targeting strategies.

17098734|t|Sequestration of retinyl esters is essential for retinoid signaling in the zebrafish embryo.
17098734|a|For vertebrate development, vitamin A (all-trans retinol) is required in quantitative different amounts and spatiotemporal distribution for the production of retinoic acid, a nuclear hormone receptor ligand, and 11-cis retinal, the chromophore of visual pigments. We show here for zebrafish that embryonic retinoid homeostasis essentially depends on the activity of a leci-thin:retinol acyltransferase (Lratb). During embryogenesis, lratb is expressed in mostly non-overlapping domains opposite to retinal dehydrogenase 2 (raldh2), the key enzyme for retinoic acid synthesis. Blocking retinyl ester formation by a targeted knock down of Lratb results in significantly increased retinoic acid levels, which lead to severe embryonic patterning defects. Thus, we provide evidence that a balanced competition between Lratb and Raldh2 for yolk vitamin A defines embryonic compartments either for retinyl ester or retinoic acid synthesis. This homeostatic mechanism dynamically adjusts embryonic retinoic acid levels for gene regulation, concomitantly sequestering excess yolk vitamin A in the form of retinyl esters for the establishment of larval vision later during development.

2855368|t|A naloxone-steroid hybrid azine with selective and long-acting opioid antagonism at delta receptors in vitro.
2855368|a|The interaction of naloxone estrone azine (N-EH) with various opioid receptor types was studied in vitro. Its potency as an antagonist of opioid effects was compared to that of naloxone on the electrically evoked contractions of mouse vas deferens (Mvd) and guinea pig ileum myenteric plexus longitudinal muscle (Gpi) preparations. N-EH was found to be 9-fold more potent than naloxone in antagonizing the effects of D-Ala2-Leu5-enkephalin in the Mvd and 22-fold less potent in antagonizing normorphine in the Gpi. In the Mvd, the recovery half-time for N-EH was longer than 1000 min. Neither compound showed agonism. The two compounds were also compared for their capacity to displace the binding of 3H-D-Ala2-Leu5-enkephalin, 3H-dihydromorphine, and 3H-ethylketocyclazocine to rat brain membranes under conditions where delta, mu, and kappa sites were labeled. The relative affinities were 0.70, 0.16, and 0.14 for N-EH and 0.05, 0.87, and 0.08 for naloxone, respectively. Thus, compared to naloxone, which is mu selective, N-EH is a delta-selective antagonist.

23019274|t|Novel assays for detection of urinary KIM-1 in mouse models of kidney injury.
23019274|a|Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) has been qualified by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency as a urinary biomarker to monitor preclinical nephrotoxicity in rats and on a case-by-case basis for the translation of potentially nephrotoxic drugs into first-in human studies. Although mouse models are widely employed in preclinical studies, few urinary biomarker studies have been performed in mice due to limited urine availability and lack of sensitive assays. Here, we report the development and validation of two different assays for quantitative assessment of mouse urinary KIM-1 (uKIM-1) and compare the sensitivity of KIM-1 relative to other standard markers in ischemia reperfusion and aristolochic acid (AA)-induced kidney injury in mice. A sensitive, reproducible, and quantitative microbead-based KIM-1 ELISA was established, which requires only 10 ul urine for triplicate determination with an assay range of 12.21 pg/ml to 50 ng/ml. The second assay is a laminar flow dipstick assay, which has an assay range of 195 pg/ml to 50 ng/ml and provides quantitative assessment of KIM-1 in 15 min. uKIM-1 levels increased with increasing time of ischemia or time after AA administration. After only 10-min ischemia followed by 24-h reperfusion, uKIM-1 was significantly elevated by 13-fold, whereas serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen, N-acetyl-b-glucosaminidase (NAG), and proteinuria levels did not change. After AA administration, uKIM-1 levels were significantly upregulated by greater than threefold within 12 h, whereas sCr and NAG levels were unchanged. Mouse KIM-1 was stable for multiple freeze-thaw cycles, for up to 5 days at room temperature and up to at least an year when stored at -80oC.

8098142|t|Histamine enhances the depolarizing afterpotential of immunohistochemically identified vasopressin neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus via H1-receptor activation.
8098142|a|Previous studies have demonstrated that histamine primarily excites unidentified neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus. We investigated the neuromodulatory effects of histamine on immunohistochemically identified vasopressin neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus using intracellular recording techniques from the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explant. Exogenous application of histamine (0.1-100 microM) to vasopressinergic neurons produced a small membrane depolarization accompanied by an increase of up to 100% in the amplitude of the depolarizing afterpotential that follows current-evoked trains of action potentials. The enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential by histamine did not depend upon the depolarization. Further, histamine enhanced the amplitude of the depolarizing afterpotential when blocking the afterhyperpolarizing potential with d-tubocurarine or apamin, and in the presence of tetrodotoxin and d-tubocurarine or apamin, indicating a postsynaptic action of histamine on the depolarizing afterpotential that is not simply a reflection of a decrease in the afterhyperpolarizing potential. These toxins also had no effect on the histamine-induced depolarization. The enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential by histamine was mimicked by the histamine H1-receptor agonist 2-thiazolylethylamine and was reduced or blocked by the H1-receptor antagonist promethazine, but was not blocked or reduced in the presence of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine. In summary, these results show that the excitatory effect of histamine on immunohistochemically identified vasopressin neurons in the supraoptic nucleus is due in part to the H1-receptor-mediated enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential independent of any change in the afterhyperpolarizing potential or membrane potential.

10593931|t|Identification of amino acids in the factor XI apple 3 domain required for activation of factor IX.
10593931|a|Activated coagulation factor XI (factor XIa) proteolytically cleaves its substrate, factor IX, in an interaction requiring the factor XI A3 domain (Sun, Y., and Gailani, D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 29023-29028). To identify key amino acids involved in factor IX activation, recombinant factor XIa proteins containing alanine substitutions for wild-type sequence were expressed in 293 fibroblasts and tested in a plasma clotting assay. Substitutions for Ile(183)-Val(191) and Ser(195)-Ile(197) at the N terminus and for Ser(258)-Ser(264) at the C terminus of the A3 domain markedly decreased factor XI coagulant activity. The plasma protease prekallikrein is structurally homologous to factor XI, but activated factor IX poorly. A chimeric factor XIa molecule with the A3 domain replaced with A3 from prekallikrein (FXI/PKA3) activated factor IX with a K(m) 35-fold greater than that of wild-type factor XI. FXI/PKA3 was used as a template for a series of proteins in which prekallikrein A3 sequence was replaced with factor XI sequence to restore factor IX activation. Clotting and kinetics studies using these chimeras confirmed the results obtained with alanine mutants. Amino acids between Ile(183) and Val(191) are necessary for proper factor IX activation, but additional sequence between Ser(195) and Ile(197) or between Phe(260) and Ser(265) is required for complete restoration of activation.

23212306|t|Impairment of novel object recognition in adulthood after neonatal exposure to diazinon.
23212306|a|Diazinon is an organophosphate pesticide that is still heavily used in agriculture, home gardening, and indoor pest control in Japan. The present study investigated the effect of neonatal exposure to diazinon on hippocampus-dependent novel object recognition test performance and the expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and its signal transduction pathway-related genes in the hippocampi of young adult and adult mice. Male offspring of C3H/HeN mice were subcutaneously treated with 0, 0.5, or 5 mg/kg of diazinon for 4 consecutive days beginning on postnatal day (PND) 8. Beginning on PND 46 or PND 81, a novel object recognition test was performed on 4 consecutive days. The hippocampi were collected on PND 50 or PND 85 after the completion of the novel object recognition test, and the expression levels of neurotrophins and the NMDA receptor and its signal transduction pathway-related genes were examined using real-time RT-PCR. Diazinon-injected mice exhibited a poor ability to discriminate between novel and familiar objects during both the PND 49 and the PND 84 tests. The NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B and the related protein kinase calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)-IV and the transcription factor cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB)-1 mRNA levels were reduced in the PND 50 mice. However, no significant changes in the expressions of the NMDA subunits and their signal transduction molecules were observed in the hippocampi of the PND 85 mice. The expression level of nerve growth factor mRNA was significantly reduced in the PND 50 or 85 mice. These results indicate that neonatal diazinon exposure impaired the hippocampus-dependent novel object recognition ability, accompanied by a modulation in the expressions of the NMDA receptor and neurotrophin in young adult and adult mice.

10694244|t|Inhibition by troglitazone of the antigen-induced production of leukotrienes in immunoglobulin E-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells.
10694244|a|1. The effect of troglitazone, an anti-diabetic drug with insulin-sensitizing action, on antigen-induced production of leukotriene (LT) B(4), C(4) and E(4) and prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) was examined in dinitrophenol (DNP)-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE)-sensitized RBL-2H3 mast cells following stimulation by the antigen, DNP-conjugated human serum albumin. Levels of LTB(4), C(4) and E(4) and PGD(2) in the conditioned medium were enzyme-immunoassayed. 2. Troglitazone inhibited the antigen-induced production of LTB(4), C(4) and E(4) and the potency of the inhibition was comparable to that of zileuton, a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and a clinically used anti-asthmatic drug. Neither troglitazone nor zileuton affected antigen-induced production of PGD(2), arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipids and degranulation. 3. Troglitazone inhibited LTB(4) production by the supernatant fraction of RBL-2H3 cell lysate with similar potency to zileuton, suggesting that troglitazone inhibits LT production by direct inhibition of 5-LOX activity. 4. Furthermore, it was shown that troglitazone as well as zileuton inhibited LTB(4) production in A23187-stimulated rat peritoneal neutrophils. 5. These findings suggest that troglitazone inhibits antigen-induced LT production in the IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells and A23187-stimulated rat peritoneal neutrophils by direct inhibition of 5-LOX activity.

23267767|t|Development of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a inhibitors: effect of ortho-carborane substituents on HIF transcriptional activity under hypoxia.
23267767|a|A series of substituted ortho-carboranylphenoxyacetanilides were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit hypoxia-induced HIF-1 transcriptional activity using a cell-based reporter assay in HeLa cells expressing the HRE-dependent firefly luciferase reporter construct (HRE-Luc) and constitutively expressing CMV-driven Renilla luciferase reporter, and their ability to inhibit cell growth (GI(50)) using the MTT assay. Among the compounds synthesized, 1g and 1l showed significant inhibition of hypoxia-induced HIF-1 transcriptional activity (IC(50): 1.9 + 0.4 and 1.4 + 0.2 uM, respectively). Both compounds suppressed HIF-1a accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. The porcine heart malate dehydrogenase (MDH) refolding assay revealed that compound 1l inhibited human Hsp60 chaperone activity (IC(50): 6.80 + 0.25 uM) and this inhibition activity was higher than that of ETB (IC(50): 10.9 + 0.63 uM).

1680855|t|Involvement of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins in the hormonal inhibition of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ currents in an insulin-secreting cell line (RINm5F).
1680855|a|Adrenaline inhibits insulin secretion via pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanisms. Since voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents play a key role in insulin secretion, we examined whether adrenaline modulates voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents of the rat insulinoma cell line, RINm5F. In the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, dihydropyridine- but not omega-conotoxin-sensitive Ca2+ currents were identified. Adrenaline via alpha 2-adrenoceptors inhibited the Ca2+ currents by about 50%. Somatostatin which also inhibits insulin secretion was less efficient (inhibition by 20%). The hormonal inhibition of Ca2+ currents was not affected by intracellularly applied cAMP but blocked by the intracellularly applied GDP analog guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) and by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. In contrast to adrenaline and somatostatin, galanin, another inhibitor of insulin secretion, reduced Ca2+ currents by about 40% in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. Immunoblot experiments performed with antibodies generated against synthetic peptides revealed that membranes of RINm5F cells possess four pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins including Gi1, Gi2, Go2, and another Go subtype, most likely representing Go1. In membranes of control but not of pertussis toxin-treated cells, adrenaline via alpha 2-adrenoceptors stimulated incorporation of the photo-reactive GTP analog [alpha-32P]GTP azidoanilide into pertussis toxin substrates comigrating with the alpha-subunits of Gi2, Go2, and the not further identified Go subtype. The present findings indicate that activated alpha 2-adrenoceptors of RINm5F cells interact with multiple G-proteins, i.e. two forms of Go and with Gi2. These G-proteins are likely to be involved in the adrenaline-induced inhibition of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ currents and in other signal transduction pathways contributing to the adrenaline-induced inhibition of insulin secretion.

23619613|t|Soluble polysialylated NCAM: a novel player of the innate immune system in the lung.
23619613|a|Posttranslational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) by polysialic acid (polySia) is well studied in the nervous system and described as a dynamic modulator of plastic processes like precursor cell migration, axon fasciculation, and synaptic plasticity. Here, we describe a novel function of polysialylated NCAM (polySia-NCAM) in innate immunity of the lung. In mature lung tissue of healthy donors, polySia was exclusively attached to the transmembrane isoform NCAM-140 and located to intracellular compartments of epithelial cells. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, however, increased polySia levels and processing of the NCAM carrier were observed. Processing of polysialylated NCAM was reproduced in a mouse model by bleomycin administration leading to an activation of the inflammasome and secretion of interleukin (IL)-1b. As shown in a cell culture model, polySia-NCAM-140 was kept in the late trans-Golgi apparatus of lung epithelial cells and stimulation by IL-1b or lipopolysaccharide induced metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding, resulting in the secretion of soluble polySia-NCAM. Interestingly, polySia chains of secreted NCAM neutralized the cytotoxic activity of extracellular histones as well as DNA/histone-network-containing "neutrophil extracellular traps", which are formed during invasion of microorganisms. Thus, shedding of polySia-NCAM by lung epithelial cells may provide a host-protective mechanism to reduce tissue damage during inflammatory processes.

17498496|t|[Effects of Panax notoginseng saponins on mRNA expressions of interleukin-1 beta, its correlative factors and cysteinyl-aspartate specific protease after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats].
17498496|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) on mRNA expressions of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), cysteinyl-aspartate specific protease-1 (caspase-1), caspase-3 and caspase-8 after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion in rats was induced by the method of nylon monofilament via the internal carotid artery. PNS was administered intraperitoneally respectively five minutes before cerebral ischemia and twelve hours after cerebral ischemia. After cerebral ischemia for two hours followed by reperfusion for twenty two hours, the mRNA expressions of IL-1 beta, IL-1RI, IL-1ra, ICAM-1, caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 in brain tissue were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: After cerebral ischemia for two hours followed by reperfusion for twenty two hours, the mRNA expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL-1RI, IL-1ra, ICAM-1, caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 in brain tissue in the untreated group were obviously elevated as compared to those in the sham-operation group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The mRNA expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL-1RI, IL-1ra in brain tissue in the PNS group were lower than those in the untreated group, but higher than those in the sham-operation group, and without statistical differences as compared to those in the sham-operation group and in the untreated group (P>0.05). The mRNA expression level of caspase-3 in brain tissue in the PNS group was significantly lower than that in the untreated group (P<0.05), but PNS had no effect on the mRNA expression levels of ICAM-1, caspase-1 and caspase-8 in brain tissue. CONCLUSION: PNS can inhibit the mRNA expression of caspase-3, slightly inhibit the mRNA expressions of IL-1 beta and its correlative inflammatory factors in brain tissue. The protective effects of PNS on cerebral injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion may be related to inhibiting the mRNA expressions of caspase-3, IL-1 beta and its correlative inflammatory factors in brain tissue.

12679340|t|Yeast epiarginase regulation, an enzyme-enzyme activity control: identification of residues of ornithine carbamoyltransferase and arginase responsible for enzyme catalytic and regulatory activities.
12679340|a|In the presence of ornithine and arginine, ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase) and arginase form a one-to-one enzyme complex in which the activity of OTCase is inhibited whereas arginase remains catalytically active. The mechanism by which these nonallosteric enzymes form a stable complex triggered by the binding of their respective substrates raises the question of how such a cooperative association is induced. Analyses of mutations in both enzymes identify residues that are required for their association, some of them being important for catalysis. In arginase, two cysteines at the C terminus of the protein are crucial for its epiarginase function but not for its catalytic activity and trimeric structure. In OTCase, mutations of putative ornithine binding residues, Asp-182, Asn-184, Asn-185, Cys-289, and Glu-256 greatly reduced the affinity for ornithine and impaired the interaction with arginase. The four lysine residues located in the SMG loop, Lys-260, Lys-263, Lys-265, and Lys-268, also play an important role in mediating the sensitivity of OTCase to ornithine and to arginase and appear to be involved in transducing and enhancing the signal given by ornithine for the closure of the catalytic domain.

10727528|t|Aspirin and sodium salicylate inhibit endothelin ETA receptors by an allosteric type of mechanism.
10727528|a|Aspirin is a commonly used drug with a wide pharmacological spectrum including antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective actions. This study shows that aspirin and sodium salicylate, its major blood metabolite, reverse contractile actions of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in isolated rat aorta and human mammary arteries. They also prevent the intracellular Ca(2+) mobilizing action of ET-1 in cultured endothelial cells but not those of neuromedin B or UTP. Inhibition of the actions of ET-1 by salicylates is apparently competitive. Salicylates inhibit (125)I-ET-1 binding to recombinant rat ETA receptors. Salicylic acid promotes dissociation of (125)I-ET-1 ETA receptor complexes both in the absence and the presence of unlabeled ET-1. It has no influence on the rate of association of (125)I-ET-1 to ETA receptors. Salicylates do not promote dissociation of (125)I-ET-1 ETB receptor complexes. Salicylates potentiate relaxing actions of receptor antagonists such as bosentan. It is concluded that salicylates are allosteric inhibitors of ETA receptors. The results also suggest that: 1) irreversible ET-1 binding probably limits actions of receptor antagonists in vivo, and 2) an association of salicylates and ETA receptor antagonists should be used to evaluate the physiopathological role of ET-1 and may be of therapeutic interest in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.

12955294|t|The serotonin transporter polymorphism, 5HTTLPR, is associated with a faster response time to sertraline in an elderly population with major depressive disorder.
12955294|a|RATIONALE: A common polymorphism (5HTTLPR) within the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (LSC6A4) has been shown to influence response time as well as overall response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in subjects with major depressive disorder. We hypothesized that a similar effect in response time to sertraline would be observed and that no effect on response time would be seen in a placebo arm. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that subjects homozygous for the long allele at the 5HTTLPR polymorphism would respond more rapidly to sertraline than subjects carrying one or two copies of the short allele. METHODS: HAM-D and CGI-I responses to sertraline and placebo were measured weekly in the context of an 8-week, placebo-controlled study in elderly depressed subjects. Genotyping of the 5HTTLPR polymorphism was performed to test for correlations with response at each week in the sertraline and placebo groups ( n=206). RESULTS: Subjects homozygous for the long allele of 5HTTLPR showed a significant increase in response at week 1 and week 2, as assessed by the CGI-I scale compared with subjects carrying one or two copies of the short allele ( P=0.01 at both weeks). No significant difference was observed in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that genetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene effects the response time to sertraline and provides complementing evidence to previous reports that this polymorphism affects response time to other SSRIs.

To study the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, the effects of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol [no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA)], alprenolol (weak ISA) and mepindolol (strong ISA) on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density--assessed by (+/-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding--and plasma renin activity (PRA) were investigated in male healthy volunteers aged 23-35 years. Propranolol treatment (4 X 40 mg/day) increased the density of beta 2-adrenoceptors by 25% after 2 days; concomitantly PRA and heart rate were reduced. During treatment beta 2-adrenoceptor density remained elevated. After withdrawal of propranolol PRA reached pre-drug levels rapidly, while heart rate was significantly enhanced. Beta 2-Adrenoceptor density, however, declined slowly being still significantly increased after 3 days, although propranolol was not detectable in plasma after 24 h. The affinity of ICYP to beta 2-adrenoceptors was not changed during or after treatment. Mepindolol treatment (2 X 5 mg/day) caused a 30% decrease of beta 2-adrenoceptor density and PRA after 2 days; both parameters remained reduced during treatment. After withdrawal, PRA reached rapidly pre-drug levels, whereas beta 2-adrenoceptor density was still after 4 days significantly diminished. The KD-values for ICYP, however, were not changed. During and after treatment heart rate was not affected. Alprenolol treatment (4 X 100 mg/day) led to a rapid fall in PRA, but did not significantly affect beta 2-adrenoceptor density. It is concluded, that the ISA may play an important role in modulating beta 2-adrenoceptor density and hence tissue responsiveness to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

23577589|t|Flexibly timed once-daily dosing with degludec: a new ultra-long-acting basal insulin.
23577589|a|Insulin treatment in type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D) is highly efficacious, but in practice, non-adherence and ineffective dose titration limit its effectiveness. Barriers to more effective insulin treatment are numerous, including hypoglycaemia, fear of hypoglycaemia and concern about weight gain. The regular treatment timing needed with conventional basal insulins [neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin and the first-generation analogues glargine and detemir] may also make adherence to these treatments problematic for many patients. Indeed, surveys indicate that the rigidity of this schedule induces some patients with T1D and T2D to omit insulin doses. Degludec is a novel, ultra-long-acting basal insulin analogue that is as effective as insulin glargine, but significantly reduces patients' risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Because of its peakless, extended and highly predictable glucose-lowering effect, once-daily dosing on a flexible schedule may be feasible with degludec. Studies testing this possibility suggest that degludec tolerates day-to-day variation in dose timing while maintaining full efficacy and low risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Degludec would appear to be an appropriate choice for patients being considered for a basal analogue, and it may be particularly well suited to patients with unpredictable social or work schedules, those who travel frequently and those who find rigid scheduling of their insulin injections a burden or barrier to regular treatment.

16494569|t|Abnormally high plasma levels of vitamin B6 in children with autism not taking supplements compared to controls not taking supplements.
16494569|a|BACKGROUND: There have been many studies of the effect of high-dose supplementation of vitamin B6 on children and adults with autism, with all but one reporting benefits. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the biochemical basis for vitamin B6 therapy by measuring the level of total vitamin B6 in the plasma of unsupplemented children with autism spectrum disorder compared to unsupplemented control subjects. PARTICIPANTS: Children with autism spectrum disorders (n = 35, age 3-9 years) and unrelated typical children (n = 11, age 6-9 years), all from Arizona, were studied. (This includes the data from 24 children with autism from our previous study.) METHODOLOGY: A microbiologic assay was used to measure the level of total vitamin B6 (including phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms), in a blinded fashion. RESULTS: Children with autism had a 75% higher level of total vitamin B6 than the controls (medians of 56 versus 32 ng/mL, respectively, p = 0.00002). Most of the autistic children (77%) had levels that were more than 2 standard deviations above the median value of the controls. The autistic girls (n = 5) also had elevated levels (mean of 54.6 ng/mL, median of 60 ng/mL). DISCUSSION: These results are consistent with previous studies that found that: (1) pyridoxal kinase had a very low activity in children with autism and (2) pyridoxal 5 phosphate (PLP) levels are unusually low in children with autism. Thus, it appears that the low conversion of pyridoxal and pyridoxine to PLP results in low levels of PLP, which is the active cofactor for 113 known enzymatic reactions, including the formation of many key neurotransmitters. CONCLUSIONS: Total vitamin B6 is abnormally high in autism, consistent with previous reports of an impaired pyridoxal kinase for the conversion of pyridoxine and pyridoxal to PLP. This may explain the many published studies of benefits of high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation in some children and adults with autism.

10752671|t|Evaluation of flutamide genotoxicity in rats and in primary human hepatocytes.
10752671|a|Flutamide, an effective competitive inhibitor of the androgen receptor used orally for palliative treatment of prostatic carcinoma and regulation of prostatic hyperplasia was evaluated for its genotoxic effects in the intact rat and in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Negative responses were obtained in all the in vivo assays as well as in the in vitro assay. In rats given a single oral dose of 500 mg/kg flutamide, fragmentation and repair of liver DNA were absent, and no increase was observed in the frequency of micronucleated hepatocytes. In the liver of rats given flutamide as initiating agent at the dose of 500 mg/kg/week for 6 successive weeks, gamma-glutamyltraspeptidase-positive foci were detected only in 3 of 10 rats. There was no evidence of a promoting effect on the development of aberrant crypt foci in rats given 100 mg/kg flutamide on alternate days for 8 successive weeks. In primary cultures of human hepatocytes from one male and one female donor DNA fragmentation as measured by the Comet assays, and DNA repair synthesis as revealed by quantitative autoradiography, were absent after a 20 hr exposure to flutamide concentrations ranging from 18 to 56 microM. Taken as a whole, our results seem to indicate that flutamide is a non-genotoxic drug.

16972995|t|Brugada syndrome.
16972995|a|A novel clinical entity characterized by ST segment elevation in right precordial leads (V1 to V3), incomplete or complete right bundle branch block, and susceptibility to ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death has been described by Brugada et al. in 1992. This disease is now frequently called "Brugada syndrome" (BrS). The prevalence of BrS in the general population is unknown. The suggested prevalence ranges from 5/1,000 (Caucasians) to 14/1,000 (Japanese). Syncope, typically occurring at rest or during sleep (in individuals in their third or fourth decades of life) is a common presentation of BrS. In some cases, tachycardia does not terminate spontaneously and it may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and lead to sudden death. Both sporadic and familial cases have been reported and pedigree analysis suggests an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. In approximately 20% of the cases BrS is caused by mutations in the SCN5A gene on chromosome 3p21-23, encoding the cardiac sodium channel, a protein involved in the control of myocardial excitability. Since the use of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the only therapeutic option of proven efficacy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of cardiac arrest, the identification of high-risk subjects is one of the major goals in the clinical decision-making process. Quinidine may be regarded as an adjunctive therapy for patients at higher risk and may reduce the number of cases of ICD shock in patients with multiple recurrences.

8925876|t|In functional experiments, risperidone is selective, not for the B, but for the A subtype of alpha 1-adrenoceptors.
8925876|a|The potency of the antipsychotic drug, risperidone, to antagonize alpha 1A-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction in rat vas deferens and vasoconstriction in rat perfused kidney, and alpha 1B-adrenoceptor-mediated contractions in spleen from guinea-pig and mouse was evaluated and compared to that of alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtype-discriminating antagonists. Prazosin was found to be unselective; 2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane (WB 4101), 5-methyl-urapidil, indoramin and (+)-niguldipine were confirmed as selective for the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor, whereas spiperone was weakly alpha 1B-selective. Risperidone was equipotent to prazosin at alpha 1A-adrenoceptors in rat vas deferens and kidney. However, at guinea-pig and mouse splenic alpha 1B-adrenoceptors, the affinity values of risperidone were 10-fold lower than those of prazosin. Thus, in functional experiments the presumed high selectivity of risperidone for the B subtype of alpha 1-adrenoceptors could not be confirmed, the drug instead appears to be moderately selective (10-fold) for the A subtype.

23123662|t|Contributions of rat Ctr1 to the uptake and toxicity of copper and platinum anticancer drugs in dorsal root ganglion neurons.
23123662|a|Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are affected by platinum-induced neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative processes associated with disturbed copper homeostasis and transport. This study aimed to understand the role of copper transporter 1 (Ctr1) in the uptake and toxicity of copper and platinum drugs in cultured rat DRG neurons, and the functional activities of rat Ctr1 (rCtr1) as a membrane transporter of copper and platinum drugs. Heterologous expression of rCtr1 in HEK293 cells (HEK/rCtr1 cells) increased the uptake and cytotoxicity of copper, oxaliplatin, cisplatin and carboplatin, in comparison to isogenic vector-transfected control cells. Cultured rat DRG neurons endogenously expressed rCtr1 protein on their neuronal cell body plasma membranes and cytoplasm, and displayed substantial capacity for taking up copper, but were resistant to copper toxicity. The uptake of copper by both cultured rat DRG neurons and HEK/rCtr1 cells was saturable and inhibited by cold temperature, silver and zinc, consistent with it being mediated by rCtr1. Cultured rat DRG neurons accumulated platinum during their exposure to oxaliplatin and were sensitive to oxaliplatin cytotoxicity. The accumulation of platinum by both cultured rat DRG neurons and HEK/rCtr1 cells, during oxaliplatin exposure, was saturable and temperature dependent, but was inhibited by copper only in HEK/rCtr1 cells. In conclusion, rCtr1 can transport copper and platinum drugs, and sensitizes cells to their cytotoxicities. DRG neurons display substantial capacity for accumulating copper via a transport process mediated by rCtr1, but appear able to resist copper toxicity and use alternative mechanisms to take up oxaliplatin.

1356794|t|Evidence that an alpha 2A-adrenoceptor subtype mediates antinociception in mice.
1356794|a|In the hot-plate test in mice, the antinociceptive action of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, UK 14,304, was abolished by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan, the potent alpha 2A-adrenoceptor antagonist, RX 821002 and the preferential alpha 2A-adrenoceptor antagonist, BRL 44408. In contrast, the preferential alpha 2B- (and alpha 2C)-adrenoceptor ligands ('antagonists'), ARC-239, BRL 41992 and prazosin were inactive. The preferential alpha 2A-adrenoceptor partial agonist, guanfacine, partially inhibited UK 14,304-induced antinociception. Further, guanfacine BRL 44408 reversibly elicited submaximal antinociception. It is concluded that alpha 2A-adrenoceptors mediate antinociception in mice.

8636122|t|Structural features of the central cannabinoid CB1 receptor involved in the binding of the specific CB1 antagonist SR 141716A.
8636122|a|The antagonist SR 141716A has a high specificity for the central CB1 cannabinoid receptor and negligeable affinity for the peripheral CB2 receptor, making it an excellent tool for probing receptor structure-activity relationships. From binding experiments with mutated CB1 and with chimeric CB1/CB2 receptors we have begun to identify the domains of CB1 implicated in the recognition of SR 141716A. Receptors were transiently expressed in COS-3 cells, and their binding characteristics were studied with SR 141716A and with CP 55,940, an agonist recognized equally well by the two receptors. The region delineated by the fourth and fifth transmembrane helices of CB1 proved to be crucial for high affinity binding of SR 141716A. The CB1 and CB2 second extracellular loops, e2, were exchanged, modifications that had no effect on SR 141716A binding in the CB1 variant but that eliminated CP 55,940 binding in both mutants. The replacement of the conserved cysteine residues in e2 of CB2 by serine also eliminated CP 55,940 binding, but replacement of those in CB1 resulted in the sequestration of the mutated receptors in the cell cytoplasm. The e2 domain thus plays some role in CP 55,940 binding but none in SR 141716A recognition, binding of the latter clearly implicating residues in the adjoining transmembrane helices.

9596079|t|Peripheral blood mononuclear cells express mutated NCCT mRNA in Gitelman's syndrome: evidence for abnormal thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransport.
9596079|a|Genetic analysis has demonstrated complete linkage between the human thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter gene (NCCT or TSC) and Gitelman's syndrome (GS). Several genomic NCCT mutations have been reported. This study was performed to determine whether peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) express NCCT mRNA and whether defective PBMC NaCl cotransport could be demonstrated in GS. PBMC were isolated from two brothers with GS, their parents, and healthy control subjects. Northern analysis revealed that NCCT mRNA is expressed in PBMC. The sequence of full-length NCCT cDNA amplified from normal PBMC was identical to human renal NCCT cDNA. Two different mutations were detected in the patients' NCCT cDNA (compound heterozygote). In cDNA derived from the patient's maternal allele, exon 24 was deleted, resulting in a premature stop codon (after amino acid 920). cDNA derived from the patient's paternal allele had an additional 119-bp insertion between exons 3 and 4, generating a premature stop codon (after amino acid 187). The patient's genomic DNA had a previously described 5' splice site mutation in intron 24, GGT --> GTT (maternal allele), and a new 3' splice site mutation in intron 3, CAG --> CAA (paternal allele), which resulted in the activation of a nearby cryptic splice site in intron 3. The latter mutation was not present in 300 normal chromosomes. To determine the functional significance of these findings, chlorothiazide-inhibitable 22Na uptake was measured in PBMC from control subjects, the parents, and the patients with GS in the presence of bumetanide. In control PBMC, chlorothiazide inhibited 22Na uptake by approximately 9%. PBMC from the two patients with GS failed to respond to chlorothiazide. These results demonstrate that PBMC can be used for mutational analysis of NCCT mRNA in patients with GS. Furthermore, functional evidence is provided that the underlying cause of GS is defective NCCT NaCl cotransport.

15795320|t|Cellular and pharmacogenetics foundation of synergistic interaction of pemetrexed and gemcitabine in human non-small-cell lung cancer cells.
15795320|a|Gemcitabine and pemetrexed are effective agents in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the present study investigates cellular and genetic aspects of their interaction against A549, Calu-1, and Calu-6 cells. Cells were treated with pemetrexed and gemcitabine, and their interaction was assessed using the combination index. The role of drug metabolism in gemcitabine cytotoxicity was examined with inhibitors of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), 5'-nucleotidase, and cytidine deaminase, whereas the role of pemetrexed targets, thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT) in drug chemosensitivity was analyzed in cytotoxicity rescue studies. The effect of gemcitabine and pemetrexed on Akt phosphorylation was investigated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to study target gene-expression profiles and its modulation by each drug. Synergistic cytotoxicity was demonstrated, and pemetrexed significantly decreased the amount of phosphorylated Akt, enhanced apoptosis, and increased the expression of dCK in A549 and Calu-6 cells, as well as the expression of the human nucleoside equilibrative transporter 1 (hENT1) in all cell lines. PCR demonstrated a correlation between dCK expression and gemcitabine sensitivity, whereas expression of TS, DHFR, and GARFT was predictive of pemetrexed chemosensitivity. These data demonstrated that 1) gemcitabine and pemetrexed synergistically interact against NSCLC cells through the suppression of Akt phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis; 2) the gene expression profile of critical genes may predict for drug chemosensitivity; and 3) pemetrexed enhances dCK and hENT1 expression, thus suggesting the role of gene-expression modulation for rational development of chemotherapy combinations.

23182946|t|Disrupted cytoskeletal homeostasis, astrogliosis and apoptotic cell death in the cerebellum of preweaning rats injected with diphenyl ditelluride.
23182946|a|In the present report 15 day-old rats were injected with 0.3umol of diphenyl ditelluride (PhTe)(2)/kg body weight and parameters of neurodegeneration were analyzed in slices from cerebellum 3 and 6 days afterwards. The earlier responses, at day 3 after injection, included hyperphosphorylation of intermediate filament (IF) proteins from astrocyte (glial fibrillary acidic protein - GFAP - and vimentin) and neuron (low-, medium- and high molecular weight neurofilament subunits: NF-L, NF-M and NF-H); increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Erk and p38MAPK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activities. Also, reactive astrogliosis takes part of the early responses to the insult with (PhTe)(2), evidenced by upregulated GFAP in Western blot, PCR and immunofluorescence analysis. Six days after (PhTe)(2) injection we found persistent astrogliosis, increased propidium iodide (PI) positive cells in NeuN positive population evidenced by flow cytometry and reduced immunofluorescence for NeuN, suggesting that the in vivo exposure to (PhTe)(2) progressed to neuronal death. Moreover, activated caspase 3 suggested apoptotic neuronal death. Neurodegeneration was related with decreased [(3)H]glutamate uptake and decreased Akt immunoreactivity, however phospho-GSK-3-b (Ser9) was not altered in (PhTe)(2) injected rat. Therefore, the present results show that the earlier cerebellar responses to (PhTe)(2) include disruption of cytoskeletal homeostasis that could be related with MAPK and PKA activation and reactive astrogliosis. Akt inhibition observed at this time could also play a role in the neuronal death evidenced afterwards. The later events of the neurodegenerative process are characterized by persistent astrogliosis and activation of apoptotic neuronal death through caspase 3 mediated mechanisms, which could be related with glutamate excitotoxicity. The progression of these responses are therefore likely to be critical for the outcome of the neurodegeneration provoked by (PhTe)(2) in rat cerebellum.

22835278|t|Leydig cell hyperplasia and Leydig cell tumour in postmenopausal women: report of two cases.
22835278|a|Leydig cell hyperplasia and Leydig cell tumours of the ovary are rare. We present two cases in which patients had increased blood levels of testosterone and frank hirsutism. Imaging showed minimal abnormalities. After adrenal disease had been ruled out, they underwent a bilateral oophorectomy. One case showed a Leydig cell hyperplasia, the other a Leydig cell tumour. An androgen producing tumour should be excluded in every woman with evidence of hirsutism or frank virilization and markedly elevated testosterone levels. Adrenal disease with androgen hypersecretion can be suspected by detailed clinical, laboratory and radiologic imaging. Although DHEAS has a good sensitivity in the detection of adrenal origin of hyperandrogenism (and hence a good negative predictive value) it is not specific (specificity ranging from 85 to 98%). Imaging of the ovaries can be helpful but does not rule out ovarian disease if normal. Indeed, diffuse stromal Leydig cell hyperplasia and Leydig cell tumours (usually small) may escape imaging and in some cases diagnosis can only be made on pathology. As these clinical entities represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, oophorectomy should be considered in postmenopausal women with hirsutism and elevated testosterone levels, after the exclusion of adrenal causes. The procedure is relatively safe and effective. Follow-up remains indicated.

23583806|t|Short-term heating reduces the anti-inflammatory effects of fresh raw garlic extracts on the LPS-induced production of NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines by downregulating allicin activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages.
23583806|a|Garlic has a variety of biologic activities, including anti-inflammatory properties. Although garlic has several biologic activities, some people dislike eating fresh raw garlic because of its strong taste and smell. Therefore, garlic formulations involving heating procedures have been developed. In this study, we investigated whether short-term heating affects the anti-inflammatory properties of garlic. Fresh and heated raw garlic extracts (FRGE and HRGE) were prepared with incubation at 25oC and 95oC, respectively, for 2h. Treatment with FRGE and HRGE significantly reduced the LPS-induced increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration (TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6) and NO through HO-1 upregulation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The anti-inflammatory effect was greater in FRGE than in HRGE. The allicin concentration was higher in FRGE than in HRGE. Allicin treatment showed reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO and increased HO-1 activity. The results show that the decrease in LPS-induced NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines in RAW 264.7 macrophages through HO-1 induction was greater for FRGE compared with HRGE. Additionally, the results indicate that allicin is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of FRGE. Our results suggest a potential therapeutic use of allicin in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.

23443810|t|Effect of miR-21 on Renal Fibrosis by Regulating MMP-9 and TIMP1 in kk-ay Diabetic Nephropathy Mice.
23443810|a|MicroRNAs (miRs) play important roles in initiation and progression of many pathologic processes. However, the roles of miRs in diabetic nephropathy remain unclear. This study was to determine whether miR-21 was involved in diabetic nephropathy and to explore the relationship between miR-21 and MMP9/TIMP1 expression in diabetic nephropathy. In situ hybridization studies showed that miR-21 was primarily localized and distributed in cortical glomerular and renal tubular cells in diabetic kk-ay kidney. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that the expression of miR-21 was significantly increased in kk-ay mice, compared with control C57BL mice. Interestingly, miR-21 expression positively correlated with urine albumin creatine ratio (ACR), TIMP1, collagen IV (ColIV), and fibronectin (FN); while negatively correlated with creatine clearance ratio (Ccr) and MMP-9 protein. Importantly, antagomir-21 not only ameliorated Ccr and ACR but also decreased TIMP1, ColIV, and FN proteins. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that miR-21 contributes to renal fibrosis by mediating MMP9/TIMP1 and that inhibition of miR-21 may be a novel target for diabetic nephropathy.

17216302|t|Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate may be curative in early-onset epileptic encephalopathy.
17216302|a|Neonatal epileptic encephalopathy can be caused by inborn errors of metabolism. These conditions are often unresponsive to treatment with conventional antiepileptic drugs. Six children with pyridox(am)ine-5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deficiency presented with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy. Two were treated with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) within the first month of life and showed normal development or moderate psychomotor retardation thereafter. Four children with late or no treatment died or showed severe mental handicap. All of the children showed atypical biochemical findings. Prompt treatment with PLP in all neonates and infants with epileptic encephalopathy should become mandatory, permitting normal development in at least some of those affected with PNPO deficiency.

16782282|t|Regulation of retinoic acid receptors alpha, beta and retinoid X receptor alpha after sciatic nerve injury.
16782282|a|Cell culture experiments indicated that activation of the retinoic acid signaling system is involved in axonal regeneration. This hypothesis was tested with sciatic nerve injury in the rat. Since the effect of retinoic acid is mediated via retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors, we investigated mRNA and protein expression of these receptors during injury-induced degeneration and regeneration. Seven days after crush injury, transcript concentrations of all retinoic acid receptors and of retinoid X receptor alpha were significantly higher than in non-lesioned nerves. Protein levels of retinoic acid receptor alpha, retinoic acid receptor beta and retinoid X receptor alpha were upregulated 4, 7 and 14 days after injury. In degenerating nerves a significant increase of retinoic acid receptor alpha was detected 7 and 14 days, and of retinoic acid receptor beta 14 and 21 days after complete transection. Immunohistochemical staining of retinoid receptors revealed their expression in Schwann cells and macrophages. In addition, we observed that retinoic acid receptor alpha and retinoid X receptor alpha appeared in the cell nuclei of macrophages during the lesion-induced inflammatory reaction, and that retinoid X receptor alpha-staining co-localized with some regenerating axons. Experiments with Schwann cell primary cultures revealed an effect of retinoic acid on the expression of the neuregulin receptor ErbB3, suggesting that one function of retinoic acid consists in the regulation of neuroglial interactions after peripheral nerve injury.

7711211|t|Norethisterone metabolites modulate the uteroglobin and progesterone receptor gene expression in prepubertal rabbits.
7711211|a|Norethisterone (NET) is a synthetic progestin, used as a contraceptive agent, that is biotransformed at target tissues into 5 alpha-NET and 3 beta,5 alpha-NET, which possess different pharmacological properties. The effects of these metabolites on the expression of uteroglobin (UG) and progesterone receptor (PR) genes, both regulated by progesterone (P4), were evaluated in the uterus of prepubertal female rabbits that were simultaneously treated with P4 (1.0 mg) for 5 consecutive days. As determined by Western and Northern blot analyses, 5 alpha-NET inhibited the P4-induced UG gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. A similar inhibition was observed with the administration of RU-486. The estrogenic agent 3 beta,5 alpha-NET and estradiol at a dose of 1.0 mg also inhibited the UG gene expression induced by P4. Both 5 alpha-NET and 3 beta,5 alpha-NET blocked the PR down-regulation induced by P4 as assessed by Western and Northern blot methods. The inhibition of UG synthesis and PR down-regulation by 5 alpha-NET and 3 beta,5 alpha-NET indicates that these NET metabolites possess antiprogestational properties.

23327993|t|Thioredoxin-mimetic peptides (TXM) reverse auranofin induced apoptosis and restore insulin secretion in insulinoma cells.
23327993|a|The thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system (TrxR/Trx1) plays a major role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Disruption of the TrxR-Trx1 system keeps Trx1 in the oxidized state leading to cell death through activation of the ASK1-Trx1 apoptotic pathway. The potential mechanism and ability of tri- and tetra-oligopeptides derived from the canonical -CxxC- motif of the Trx1-active site to mimic and enhance Trx1 cellular activity was examined. The Trx mimetics peptides (TXM) protected insulinoma INS 832/13 cells from oxidative stress induced by selectively inhibiting TrxR with auranofin (AuF). TXM reversed the AuF-effects preventing apoptosis, and increasing cell-viability. The TXM peptides were effective in inhibiting AuF-induced MAPK, JNK and p38(MAPK) phosphorylation, in correlation with preventing caspase-3 cleavage and thereby PARP-1 dissociation. The ability to form a disulfide-bridge-like conformation was estimated from molecular dynamics simulations. The TXM peptides restored insulin secretion and displayed Trx1 denitrosylase activity. Their potency was 10-100-fold higher than redox reagents like NAC, AD4, or ascorbic acid. Unable to reverse ERK1/2 phosphorylation, TXM-CB3 (NAc-Cys-Pro-Cys amide) appeared to function in part, through inhibiting ASK1-Trx dissociation. These highly effective anti-apoptotic effects of Trx1 mimetic peptides exhibited in INS 832/13 cells could become valuable in treating adverse oxidative-stress related disorders such as diabetes.

1322047|t|Anabolic effects of clenbuterol on skeletal muscle are mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptor activation.
1322047|a|The potent anabolic effects of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol on skeletal muscle have been reported to be independent of actions on beta-adrenoceptors. In the present study clenbuterol, presented to rats in the diet (4 mg/kg), caused significant increases in gastrocnemius muscle mass, protein, and RNA content and a decrease in epididymal fat pad mass. These effects were not mimicked by oral administration of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol even at high dose (52 mg/kg diet), and the effects of clenbuterol were not inhibited by addition of DL-propranolol (200 mg/kg diet). However, the selective beta 2-antagonist ICI-118,551 (200 mg/kg diet) reversed the anabolic effects of clenbuterol, and a high dose of DL-propranolol (1,000 mg/kg diet) also inhibited these actions of clenbuterol. Furthermore, continuous infusion of salbutamol (1.15 mg.kg body wt-1.day-1) via miniosmotic pumps did cause significant increases in muscle mass, protein, and RNA content. These results indicate that the anabolic effects of clenbuterol are dependent on interaction with the beta 2-adrenoceptor. However, a long duration of action appears to be required to induce the anabolic effects of beta 2-agonists.

15932636|t|Diethylcarbamazine activity against Brugia malayi microfilariae is dependent on inducible nitric-oxide synthase and the cyclooxygenase pathway.
15932636|a|BACKGROUND: Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) has been used for many years in the treatment of human lymphatic filariasis. Its mode of action is not well understood, but it is known to interact with the arachidonic acid pathway. Here we have investigated the contribution of the nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways to the activity of DEC against B. malayi microfilariae in mice. METHODS: B. malayi microfilariae were injected intravenously into mice and parasitaemia was measured 24 hours later. DEC was then administered to BALB/c mice with and without pre-treatment with indomethacin or dexamethasone and the parasitaemia monitored. To investigate a role for inducible nitric oxide in DEC's activity, DEC and ivermectin were administered to microfilaraemic iNOS-/- mice and their background strain (129/SV). Western blot analysis was used to determine any effect of DEC on the production of COX and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) proteins. RESULTS: DEC administered alone to BALB/c mice resulted in a rapid and profound reduction in circulating microfilariae within five minutes of treatment. Microfilarial levels began to recover after 24 hours and returned to near pre-treatment levels two weeks later, suggesting that the sequestration of microfilariae occurs independently of parasite killing. Pre-treatment of animals with dexamethasone or indomethacin reduced DEC's efficacy by almost 90% or 56%, respectively, supporting a role for the arachidonic acid and cyclooxygenase pathways in vivo. Furthermore, experiments showed that treatment with DEC results in a reduction in the amount of COX-1 protein in peritoneal exudate cells. Additionally, in iNOS-/- mice infected with B. malayi microfilariae, DEC showed no activity, whereas the efficacy of another antifilarial drug, ivermectin, was unaffected. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the important role of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway in DEC's mechanism of action in vivo and show that in addition to its effects on the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, it targets the cyclooxygenase pathway and COX-1. Moreover, we show for the first time that inducible nitric oxide is essential for the rapid sequestration of microfilariae by DEC.

1375507|t|Prostacyclin analogues inhibit tissue factor expression in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 via a cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism.
1375507|a|Increased expression of tissue factor procoagulant by peripheral blood monocytes has been implicated in a number of thrombotic disorders. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether stable analogues of prostacyclin, a potent endothelium-derived platelet inhibitor and vasodilator, could inhibit tissue factor expression by human monocytic cells. Exposure of monocytic tumor THP-1 cells to 100 ng/ml endotoxin, 2 units/ml interleukin-1 beta, or 5 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-alpha for 4 hours led to increased tissue factor procoagulant activity. Preincubation for 30 minutes with iloprost, ciprostene, and carbacyclin led to a dose-dependent inhibition of tissue factor expression induced by all three challenging agents. Iloprost was the most potent: 50% inhibition occurred at 5 nM, a concentration close to the reported dissociation constant for iloprost binding to the platelet prostacyclin receptor. An orally active analogue, cicaprost, was equally effective against endotoxin-induced tissue factor expression. Carbacyclin and ciprostene were 100 times less potent. Iloprost prevented the endotoxin-induced expression of tissue factor antigen on the surface of THP-1 cells, as determined by flow cytometry. Iloprost (500 pM-50 nM) increased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP. This effect was potentiated by isobutylmethylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. The inhibitory effects of iloprost on tissue factor expression were also potentiated by isobutylmethylxanthine and mimicked by forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP but not dibutyryl cyclic GMP. These results suggest that prostacyclin may play a role in downregulating tissue factor expression in monocytes, at least in part via elevation of intracellular levels of cyclic AMP.

12093311|t|Renal failure associated with the use of celecoxib and rofecoxib.
12093311|a|OBJECTIVE: Celecoxib and rofecoxib are two relatively new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that selectively inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzyme at therapeutic concentrations. The nephrotoxic potential of selective COX-2 inhibitors has not been clearly established. This study was conducted in order to understand the association between acute renal failure and the two COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib. METHODS: A search was performed in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) to identify cases of renal failure submitted to the FDA. A MEDLINE search of the English language literature was also performed to identify published cases of renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two and 142 domestic US cases of celecoxib and rofecoxib-associated renal failure, respectively, were identified in the AERS database. The literature search identified 19 cases of acute renal impairment in association with celecoxib and rofecoxib. In addition, drug regulatory authorities in the UK, Canada, and Australia have received about 50 reports of renal failure with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Descriptive statistics of the AERS cases have been summarised in this report. CONCLUSIONS: Data from AERS and published case reports suggest that use of both these drugs is associated with renal effects similar to that of conventional nonselective NSAIDs. Physicians should be aware that serious or life-threatening renal failure has been reported in patients with normal or impaired renal function after short-term therapy with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Patients at greatest risk for renal injury are those with pre-existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and/or ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Kidney function should be monitored closely for any signs of potential renal injuries soon after initiating treatment with these agents, especially in high-risk populations. In addition, healthcare practitioners should adequately warn patients of the signs and symptoms of serious renal toxicity, and of the need for them to see their physician promptly if they occur. Celecoxib and rofecoxib are not recommended for use in patients with advanced renal disease.

2569356|t|The effect of histamine-H1 receptor antagonism with terfenadine on concentration-related AMP-induced bronchoconstriction in asthma.
2569356|a|Selective histamine-H1 receptor antagonists inhibit adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-induced bronchoconstriction by greater than 80% when expressed as a percentage inhibition of the FEV1 time-response curve following inhalation of the provocation concentration of AMP required to produce a 20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline (PC20). To investigate this further we have determined that, in eight mild atopic asthmatic subjects, terfenadine (180 mg), administered 3 hr pre-challenge, increases the geometric mean PC20 for histamine from 0.4 (range 0.03-3) mg/ml after placebo, to 20.2 (range 0.6-64) mg/ml following active treatment (P less than 0.0001). For AMP, the PC20 increased from 9.3 (range 1.0-113.3) mg/ml after placebo, to 150.2 (range 32.1-1177.7) mg/ml with terfenadine (P less than 0.0001). This 16.2-fold (range, 5.5-47.9) displacement to the right of the AMP concentration-response curve by a selective histamine-H1 receptor antagonist emphasizes the central role of histamine in the airways response to this nucleotide.

23024204|t|Metabolism of triethylenetetramine and 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane by the spermidine/spermine-N(1)-acetyltransferase and thialysine acetyltransferase.
23024204|a|Triethylenetetramine (TETA; Syprine; Merck Rahway, NJ), a drug for Wilson's disease, is a copper chelator and a charge-deficient analog of polyamine spermidine. We recently showed that TETA is metabolized in vitro by polyamine catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine-N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) and by thialysine acetyltransferase (SSAT2) to its monoacetylated derivative (MAT). The acetylation of TETA is increased in SSAT1-overexpressing mice compared with wild-type mice. However, SSAT1-deficient mice metabolize TETA at the same rate as the wild-type mice, indicating the existence of another N-acetylase respons 2ible for its metabolism in mice. Here, we show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of SSAT2 in HEPG2 cells and in primary hepatocytes from the SSAT1-deficient or wild-type mice reduced the metabolism of TETA to MAT. By contrast, 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane(SpmTrien), a charge-deficient spermine analog, was an extremely poor substrate of human recombinant SSAT2 and was metabolized by SSAT1 in HEPG2 cells and in wild-type primary hepatocytes. Thus, despite the similar structures of TETA and SpmTrien, SSAT2 is the main acetylator of TETA, whereas SpmTrien is primarily acetylated by SSAT1.

15665864|t|Effects of minocycline on Fas-mediated fulminant hepatitis in mice.
15665864|a|1. Minocycline has anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects on cartilage, neurons and periodontal tissues, and both properties are central to the pharmaceutical treatment of liver diseases. We investigated the effects of minocycline on fulminant hepatitis in C57BL/6J mice induced by lethal challenge of the activating anti-Fas antibody, Jo2. 2. Intraperitoneal injection of Jo2 (0.6 microg g(-1)) to mice resulted in fulminant hepatitis, as evidenced by increase of serum alanine/aspartate transaminase activities and histopathological alterations in liver sections, as well as animal death. Nevertheless, mice pretreated with three doses of minocycline (5 mg kg(-1)) resisted this lethal effect significantly. Minocycline treatment improved the survival kinetics, although to a lesser extent, when mice were challenged simultaneously with Jo2 or even treated 30 min after the lethal challenge. 3. Jo2-induced activation of caspase-3 or -9 in liver tissues was inhibited by minocycline pretreatment, and yet the direct addition of minocycline to liver extracts from Jo2-challenged mice failed to block caspase activation in vitro. Moreover, minocycline efficiently suppressed the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria of the liver tissues from Jo2-challenged mice. In contrast, caspase-8 activation and Bid truncation triggered by Jo2 were not diminished by minocycline pretreatment in mouse livers. 4. Our results suggest that easing of Fas-triggered fulminant hepatitis by minocycline may involve a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, probably through preventing cytochrome c release and thereby blocking downstream caspase activation.

23614643|t|Dimerized Glycosaminoglycan Chains Increase FGF Signaling during Zebrafish Development.
23614643|a|Proteoglycans (PGs) modulate numerous signaling pathways during development through binding of their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains to various signaling molecules, including fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). A majority of PGs possess two or more GAG side chains, suggesting that GAG multivalency is imperative for biological functions in vivo. However, only a few studies have examined the biological significance of GAG multivalency. In this report, we utilized a library of bis- and tris-xylosides that produce two and three GAG chains on the same scaffold, respectively, thus mimicking PGs, to examine the importance of GAG valency and chain type in regulating FGF/FGFR interactions in vivo in zebrafish. A number of bis- and tris-xylosides, but not mono-xylosides, caused an elongation phenotype upon their injection into embryos. In situ hybridization showed that elongated embryos have elevated expression of the FGF target gene mkp3 but unchanged expression of reporters for other pathways, indicating that FGF/FGFR signaling was specifically hyperactivated. In support of this observation, elongation can be reversed by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU5402, mRNA for the FGFR antagonist sprouty4, or FGF8 morpholino. Endogenous GAGs seem to be unaffected after xyloside treatment, suggesting that this is a gain-of-function phenotype. Furthermore, expression of a multivalent but not a monovalent GAG containing syndecan-1 proteoglycan recapitulates the elongation phenotype observed with the bivalent xylosides. On the basis of these in vivo findings, we propose a new model for GAG/FGF/FGFR interactions in which dimerized GAG chains can activate FGF-mediated signal transduction pathways.

20135071|t|Comparative efficacy and safety of the novel oral anticoagulants dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban in preclinical and clinical development.
20135071|a|Therapeutic oral anticoagulation is still commonly achieved by administration of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists that are associated with an untoward pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile leading to a high incidence of bleeding complications or therapeutic failure. Hence, there is an unmet medical need of novel easy-to-use oral anticoagulants with improved efficacy and safety. Recent developments include the identification of non-peptidic small-molecules that selectively inhibit certain serine proteases within the coagulation cascade. Of these, the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban have recently been licensed for thromboprophylaxis after orthopaedic surgery mainly in Europe. In addition, the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban is in late-stage clinical development. Each drug is prescribed at fixed doses without the need of anticoagulant monitoring. Phase III trials in orthopaedic patients essentially resulted in non-inferior efficacy of dabigatran and superior efficacy of rivaroxaban over enoxaparin without any marked differences of drug safety, while apixaban data is still controversial. However, alterations of rivaroxaban and apixaban pharmacokinetics upon interactions with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein may complicate the use of these compounds in daily practice, whereas dabigatran elimination largely depends on renal function. Hence, this review reports PK/PD, efficacy and safety data of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban throughout preclinical and clinical development.

15937104|t|Activator of G protein signaling 3 regulates opiate activation of protein kinase A signaling and relapse of heroin-seeking behavior.
15937104|a|The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is central to heroin addiction. Activation of opiate receptors in the NAc dissociates G(i/o) into alpha and betagamma subunits. Galpha(i) inhibits cAMP production, but betagamma regulates several molecular pathways, including protein kinase A (PKA). We show in NAc/striatal neurons that opiates paradoxically activate PKA signaling by means of betagamma dimers. Activation requires Galpha(i3) and an activator of G protein signaling 3 (AGS3). AGS3 competes with betagamma for binding to Galpha(i3)-GDP and enhances the action of unbound betagamma. AGS3 and Galpha(i3) knockdown prevents opiate activation of PKA signaling. In rats self-administering heroin, AGS3 antisense in the NAc core, but not shell, eliminates reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior, a model of human relapse. Thus, Galpha(i3)/betagamma/AGS3 appears to mediate mu opiate receptor activation of PKA signaling as well as heroin-seeking behavior.

10800083|t|Molecular characterization of the surface of apoptotic neutrophils: implications for functional downregulation and recognition by phagocytes.
10800083|a|We have used a panel of monoclonal antibodies and lectins to examine the profile of surface molecule expression on human neutrophils that have undergone spontaneous apoptosis during in vitro culture. Neutrophil apoptosis was found to be accompanied by down-regulation of the immunoglobulin superfamily members PECAM-1 (CD31), ICAM-3 (CD50), CD66acde, and CD66b and the integrin-associated proteins CD63 and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (CD87) that may alter the potential for adhesive interactions. Cellular interactions may be further influenced by the reduction of the expression of surface carbohydrate moieties, including sialic acid. Reduced expression of FcgammaRII (CD32), complement receptor type 1 (CD35) and receptors for pro-inflammatory mediators C5a (CD88) and TNFalpha (CD120b) associated with apoptosis might limit neutrophil responsiveness to stimuli that trigger degranulation responses. Although many of the receptors we have examined are expressed at reduced levels on apoptotic neutrophils, we found that there was differential loss of certain receptors (e.g. CD16, CD15 and CD120b) and increased expression of aminopeptidase-N (CD13). Together with our previous data showing that expression of certain molecules e.g. LFA-3 (CD58) is not altered during neutrophil apoptosis, these data are suggestive of specific changes in receptor mobilisation and shedding associated with apoptosis. Although reduced expression of CD63 (azurophilic granules) and CR1 (specific granules) indicates that granule mobilisation does not accompany apoptosis, a monoclonal antibody (BOB78), that recognises a 90 kDa antigen localised in intracellular granules, defines a subpopulation of apoptotic neutrophils that exhibit nuclear degradation yet retain intact plasma membranes. BOB78 positive neutrophils were found to bind biotinylated thrombospondin, suggesting that this mAb defines surface molecular changes associated with exposure of thrombospondin binding moieties.

23090712|t|Lanthanum (III) regulates the nitrogen assimilation in soybean seedlings under ultraviolet-B radiation.
23090712|a|Ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-320 nm) radiation has seriously affected the growth of plants. Finding the technology/method to alleviate the damage of UV-B radiation has become a frontal topic in the field of environmental science. The pretreatment with rare earth elements (REEs) is an effective method, but the regulation mechanism of REEs is unknown. Here, the regulation effects of lanthanum (La(III)) on nitrogen assimilation in soybean seedlings (Glycine max L.) under ultraviolet-B radiation were investigated to elucidate the regulation mechanism of REEs on plants under UV-B radiation. UV-B radiation led to the inhibition in the activities of the key enzymes (nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase) in the nitrogen assimilation, the decrease in the contents of nitrate and soluble proteins, as well as the increase in the content of amino acid in soybean seedlings. The change degree of UV-B radiation at the high level (0.45 W m(-2)) was higher than that of UV-B radiation at the low level (0.15 W m(-2)). The pretreatment with 20 mg L(-1) La(III) could alleviate the effects of UV-B radiation on the activities of nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase, and glutamate dehydrogenase, promoting amino acid conversion and protein synthesis in soybean seedlings. The regulation effect of La(III) under UV-B radiation at the low level was better than that of UV-B radiation at the high level. The results indicated that the pretreatment with 20 mg L(-1) La(III) could alleviate the inhibition of UV-B radiation on nitrogen assimilation in soybean seedlings.

20448797|t|New standards in hypertension and cardiovascular risk management: focus on telmisartan.
20448797|a|Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is an important approach in managing high blood pressure, and has increasingly been shown to affect cardiovascular disease processes mediated by angiotensin II throughout the cardiovascular and renal continua. Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) displaying unique pharmacologic properties, including a longer half life than any other ARB, that result in large and sustained reductions of blood pressure. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, telmisartan has proved superior to other antihypertensive agents (valsartan, losartan, ramipril, perindopril, and atenolol) in controlling blood pressure particularly towards the end of the dosing interval. There is also clinical evidence that telmisartan reduces left ventricular hypertrophy, reduces arterial stiffness and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, and confers renoprotection. The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) study has demonstrated that telmisartan has similar cardiovascular protective effects to ramipril in a large, high-risk patient population but was better tolerated. The powerful and sustained blood pressure control apparent in clinical trials, together with cardiovascular protection and tolerability demonstrated in ONTARGET means that telmisartan may be a preferred option for patients with hypertension.

23543413|t|A Re-evaluation of the Role of hCTR1, the Human High Affinity Cu Transporter in Pt-Drug Entry into Human Cells.
23543413|a|Cisplatin (cDDP) is an anti-cancer drug used in a number of malignancies including testicular, ovarian, cervical, bladder, lung, head, and neck cancers. Its use is limited by the development of resistance, often rationalized via effects on cellular uptake. It has been claimed that hCTR1, the human high affinity copper transporter, is the major entry pathway for cDDP and related drugs via a mechanism that mimics copper. This is an unexpected property of hCTR1, a highly selective copper (I) transporter. We compared the uptake rates of copper with cDDP (and several analogs) into HEK293 cells over-expressing wild-type or mutant hCTR1, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) that do or do not express CTR1, and human ovarian tumor cells, sensitive or resistant to cDDP. We have also compared the effects of extracellular copper, which causes regulatory endocytosis of hCTR1, to those of cDDP. We confirm the correlation between higher hCTR1 levels and higher Pt-drug uptake in tumor cells sensitive to the drug. However, we show that hCTR1 is not the major entry route of platinum-drugs and that the copper transporter is not internalized in response to extracellular drug. Our data suggest the major entry pathway for platinum-drugs is not saturable at relevant concentrations and not protein-mediated. Clinical trials have been initiated that depend upon regulating membrane levels of hCTR1. If reduced drug uptake is a major factor in resistance, hCTR1 is unlikely to be a productive target in attempts to enhance efficacy, although the proteins involved in copper homeostasis may play a role.

23299080|t|3D structures and ligand specificities of nuclear xenobiotic receptors CAR, PXR and VDR.
23299080|a|The nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) control a large array of genes that code for important proteins in humans including metabolic enzymes and transporters. 3D structures for the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of these receptors are abundantly available, providing valuable insights into the ligand-binding specificity as well as the activation mechanisms. The ligand-binding site of PXR is large and flexible, whereas those of CAR and VDR are compact and rigid, respectively. In general, the ligand profiles of the receptors are in agreement with the LBD structures. The crystal structures have greatly helped us to understand the promiscuity and/or specificity of CAR, PXR and VDR.

16357751|t|Selective costimulation modulators: a novel approach for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
16357751|a|T cells have a central role in the orchestration of the immune pathways that contribute to the inflammation and joint destruction characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The requirement for a dual signal for T-cell activation and the construction of a fusion protein that prevents engagement of the costimulatory molecules required for this activation has led to a new approach to RA therapy. This approach is mechanistically distinct from other currently used therapies; it targets events early rather than late in the immune cascade, and it results in immunomodulation rather than complete immunosuppression. The fusion protein abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator that avidly binds to the CD80/CD86 ligands on an antigen-presenting cell, resulting in the inability of these ligands to engage the CD28 receptor on the T cell. Abatacept dose-dependently reduces T-cell proliferation, serum concentrations of acute-phase reactants, and other markers of inflammation, including the production of rheumatoid factor by B cells. Recent studies have provided consistent evidence that treatment with abatacept results in a rapid onset of efficacy that is maintained over the course of treatment in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate and anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies. This efficacy includes patient-centered outcomes and radiographic measurement of disease progression. Abatacept has also demonstrated a very favorable safety profile to date. This article reviews the rationale for this therapeutic approach and highlights some of the recent studies that demonstrate the benefits obtained by using abatacept. This clinical experience indicates that abatacept is a significant addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of patients with RA.

23331067|t|The transcription factor Pitx3 is expressed selectively in midbrain dopaminergic neurons susceptible to neurodegenerative stress.
23331067|a|The homeodomain transcription factor Pitx3 is critical for the survival of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. Pitx3-deficient mice exhibit severe but selective developmental loss of mDA neurons, with accompanying locomotor deficits resembling those seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) models. Here, we identify specific mDA cell subpopulations that are consistently spared in adult Pitx3-hypomorphic (aphakia) mice, demonstrating that Pitx3 is not indiscriminately required by all mDA neurons for their survival. In aphakia mice, virtually all surviving mDA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the majority of neurons in the adjacent ventral tegmental area (VTA) also express calbindin-D28k, a calcium-binding protein previously associated with resistance to injury in PD and in animal models. Cell-mapping studies in wild-type mice revealed that Pitx3 is primarily expressed in the ventral SN, a region particularly susceptible to MPTP and other dopaminergic neurotoxins. Furthermore, Pitx3-expressing SN cells are preferentially lost following MPTP treatment. Finally, SN mDA neurons in Pitx3 hemizygous mice show increased sensitivity when exposed to MPTP. Thus, SN mDA neurons are represented by at least two distinct subpopulations including MPTP-resistant Pitx3-autonomous, calbindin-positive neurons, and calbindin-negative Pitx-3-dependent cells that display elevated vulnerability to toxic injury, and probably correspond to the subpopulation that degenerates in PD. Impairment of Pitx3-dependent pathways therefore increases vulnerability of mDA neurons to toxic injury. Together, these data suggest a novel link between Pitx3 function and the selective pattern of mDA cell loss observed in PD.

11588409|t|Advances in antihypertensive combination therapy: benefits of low-dose thiazide diuretics in conjunction with omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor.
11588409|a|The preferred initial agents for the treatment of high blood pressure are low-dose thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In high-risk patients, including those with diabetes, renal insufficiency, left ventricular dysfunction, and atherosclerosis, ACE inhibitors may have specific benefit in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Omapatrilat, the prototypical vasopeptidase inhibitor, inhibits not only ACE but also neutral endopeptidase. Like conventional ACE inhibitors, omapatrilat causes extracellular volume reduction and vasodilatation; moreover, it increases levels of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides and bradykinin. Effective blood pressure control, especially in the high-risk patient, usually necessitates combination therapy. A recent study randomized 274 subjects with mild to severe hypertension (stages 1-3 diastolic blood pressure elevation) and confirmed the benefits of omapatrilat combined with hydrochlorothiazide in patients not controlled on hydrochlorothiazide alone. The frequencies of adverse events, serious adverse events, and discontinuation attributed to adverse events were similar for omapatrilat and placebo. Furthermore, there were no clinically significant changes in serum creatinine, potassium, or other laboratory parameters. Adding omapatrilat to the background of hydrochlorothiazide treatment produced statistically significant additional reductions in trough diastolic and systolic blood pressures at weeks 4 and 8.

9890894|t|Common and specific determinants for fibroblast growth factors in the ectodomain of the receptor kinase complex.
9890894|a|The assembly and activation of oligomeric complexes of FGF, the transmembrane receptor kinase (FGFR), and heparan sulfate transmit intracellular signals regulating growth and function of cells. An understanding of the structural relationships between the three subunits and their redundancy and specificity is essential for understanding the ubiquitous FGF signaling system in health and disease. Previously, we reported that a primary heparin or heparan sulfate binding site resides in a distinct sequence in immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II of the three modules of FGFR. Here we report that in the absence of flanking sequences, isolated Ig module II of FGFR1 supports the binding of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7 in respective order of affinity. None of the three FGFs detectably bind Ig module I or the IIIb and IIIc splice variants of Ig module III in the absence of flanking sequences. Ig module I and the C-terminus of Ig module III are dispensable for high-affinity binding of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7. Alterations in highly conserved Ig module II in the heparin binding domain and substitution of individual sequence domains spanning the entire sequence of Ig module II with those from Ig module I obliterated FGF binding. Addition of a specific number of FGFR sequences to the C-terminus of Ig module II resulted in a gain in affinity for FGF-7. Several site-specific alterations in the C-terminus of full-length FGFR1IIIc, an isoform that otherwise absolutely rejects FGF-7, resulted in gain of FGF-7 binding. These results suggest that a complex of Ig module II and heparan sulfate is the base common active core of the FGFR ectodomain and that flanking structural domains modify FGF affinity and determine specificity.

23091188|t|Combination lopinavir and ritonavir alter exogenous and endogenous bile acid disposition in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes.
23091188|a|Inhibition of the bile salt export pump (BSEP) can cause intracellular accumulation of bile acids and is a risk factor for drug-induced liver injury in humans. Antiretroviral protease inhibitors lopinavir (LPV) and ritonavir (RTV) are reported BSEP inhibitors. However, the consequences of LPV and RTV, alone and combined (LPV/r), on hepatocyte viability, bile acid transport, and endogenous bile acid disposition in rat hepatocytes have not been examined. The effect of LPV, RTV, and LPV/r on cellular viability and the disposition of [(3)H]taurocholic acid (TCA) and [(14)C]chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was determined in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes (SCRH) and suspended rat hepatocytes. Lactate dehydrogenase and ATP assays revealed a concentration-dependent effect of LPV and RTV on cellular viability. LPV (5 uM), alone and combined with 5 uM RTV, significantly decreased [(3)H]TCA accumulation in cells + bile of SCRHs compared with control. LPV/r significantly increased [(3)H]TCA cellular accumulation (7.7 + 0.1 pmol/mg of protein) compared with vehicle and 5 uM LPV alone (5.1 + 0.7 and 5.0 + 0.5 pmol/mg of protein). The [(3)H]TCA biliary clearance was reduced significantly by LPV and RTV and further reduced by LPV/r. LPV and RTV did not affect the initial uptake rates of [(3)H]TCA or [(14)C]CDCA in suspended rat hepatocytes. LPV (50 uM), RTV (5 uM), and LPV/r (5 and 50 uM/5 uM) significantly decreased the accumulation of total measured endogenous bile acids (TCA, glycocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, and a/b-tauromuricholic acid) in SCRH. Quantification of endogenous bile acids in SCRH may reveal important adaptive responses associated with exposure to known BSEP inhibitors.

23439561|t|NADPH Oxidase NOX5-S and Nuclear Factor kB1 Mediate Acid-Induced Microsomal Prostaglandin E Synthase-1 Expression in Barrett's Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Cells.
23439561|a|The mechanisms of progression from Barrett's esophagus (BE) to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) are not known. Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to be important in esophageal tumorigenesis. We have shown that COX-2 mediates acid-induced PGE2 production. The prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) responsible for acid-induced PGE2 production in BE, however, is not known. We found that microsomal PGES1 (mPGES1), mPGES2, and cytosolic PGES (cPGES) were present in FLO EA cells. Pulsed acid treatment significantly increased mPGES1 mRNA and protein levels but had little or no effect on mPGES2 or cPGES mRNA. Knockdown of mPGES1 by mPGES1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked acid-induced increase in PGE2 production and thymidine incorporation. Knockdown of NADPH oxidase, NOX5-S, a variant lacking calcium-binding domains, by NOX5 siRNA significantly inhibited acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, thymidine incorporation, and PGE2 production. Overexpression of NOX5-S significantly increased the luciferase activity in FLO cells transfected with a nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) in vivo activation reporter plasmid pNF-kB-Luc. Knockdown of NF-kB1 p50 by p50 siRNA significantly decreased acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, thymidine incorporation, and PGE2 production. Two novel NF-kB binding elements, GGAGTCTCCC and CGGGACACCC, were identified in the mPGES1 gene promoter. We conclude that mPGES1 mediates acid-induced increase in PGE2 production and cell proliferation. Acid-induced mPGES1 expression depends on activation of NOX5-S and NF-kB1 p50. Microsomal PGES1 may be a potential target to prevent or treat EA.

22469981|t|In vivo and in vitro models for the therapeutic targeting of Wnt signaling using a Tet-ODN89b-catenin system.
22469981|a|Although significant progress has been made in understanding the importance of Wnt signaling in the initiation of colorectal cancer, less is known about responses that accompany the reversal of oncogenic Wnt signaling. The aim of this study was to analyze in vivo and in vitro responses to an 'ideal' Wnt pathway inhibitor as a model for the therapeutic targeting of the pathway. A tetracycline-inducible transgenic mouse model expressing truncated b-catenin (DN89b-catenin) that exhibited a strong intestinal hyperplasia was analyzed during the removal of oncogenic b-catenin expression both in 3D 'crypt culture' and in vivo. Oncogenic Wnt signaling was rapidly and completely reversed. The strongest inhibition of Wnt target gene expression occurred within 24 h of doxycycline removal at which time the target genes Ascl2, Axin2 and C-myc were downregulated to levels below that in the control intestine. In vitro, the small molecule Wnt inhibitor CCT036477 induced a response within 4 h of treatment. By 7 days following doxycycline withdrawal, gene expression, cell proliferation and tissue morphology were undistinguishable from control animals.In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the reversal of Wnt signaling by inhibitors should ideally be studied within hours of treatment. The reversible system described, involving medium throughput in vitro approaches and rapid in vivo responses, should allow the rapid advance of early stage compounds into efficacy models that are more usually considered later in the drug discovery pipeline.

23523949|t|Protective effect of crocin on diazinon induced cardiotoxicity in rats in subchronic exposure.
23523949|a|This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of crocin, main component of Crocus sativus L. (Saffron) against subchronic diazinon (DZN) induced cardiotoxicity in rats. METHODS: Rats were divided into 7 groups; control (corn oil, gavage), DZN (15mg/kg/day, gavage,), crocin (12.5, 25 or 50mg/kg/day, i.p) plus DZN, vitamin E (200IU/kg, i.p, three times per week) plus DZN and crocin (50mg/kg/day, i.p) groups. Treatments were continued for 4weeks. Creatine phosphokinase MB (CK-MB), malondealdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were evaluated in heart tissue at the end of treatments. Levels of apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl2, caspase 3) and cytosolic cytochrome c were analyzed by Western blotting. Transcript levels of Bax and Bcl2 were also determined using qRT PCR. RESULTS: DZN induced histophatological damages and elevated the level of cardiac marker CK-MB. These effects were associated with increased MDA level, lower level of reduced GSH and induction of apoptosis through elevation of Bax/Bcl2 ratio (both protein and mRNA levels), cytochrome c release to the cytosol and activation caspase 3 in cardiac tissue. Crocin (25 and 50mg/kg) or vitamin E improved histopathological damages, decreased MDA and CK-MB, increased GSH content and attenuated the increase of Bax/Bcl2 ratio, activation of caspase 3 and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol induced by DZN. In summary, DZN induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in heart tissue of rat following subchronic exposure. Crocin, as an antioxidant, showed protective effects against DZN cardiotoxicity by reducing lipid peroxidation and alleviating apoptosis.

17593236|t|Efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on glimepiride alone or on glimepiride and metformin.
17593236|a|AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with sitagliptin, a highly selective once-daily oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control [glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) >or=7.5% and <or=10.5%] while on glimepiride alone or in combination with metformin. METHODS: After a screening, diet/exercise run-in and drug wash-off period, a glimepiride +/- metformin dose titration/stabilization period and a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in, 441 patients (of ages 18-75 years) were randomized to receive the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo in a 1 : 1 ratio for 24 weeks. Of these patients, 212 were on glimepiride (>or=4 mg/day) monotherapy and 229 were on glimepiride (>or=4 mg/day) plus metformin (>or=1,500 mg/day) combination therapy. Patients exceeding pre-specified glycaemic thresholds during the double-blind treatment period were provided open-label rescue therapy (pioglitazone) until study end. The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the change in HbA(1c) from baseline to Week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h post-meal glucose and lipid measurements. RESULTS: Mean baseline HbA(1c) was 8.34% in the sitagliptin and placebo groups. After 24 weeks, sitagliptin reduced HbA(1c) by 0.74% (p < 0.001) relative to placebo. In the subset of patients on glimepiride plus metformin, sitagliptin reduced HbA(1c) by 0.89% relative to placebo, compared with a reduction of 0.57% in the subset of patients on glimepiride alone. The addition of sitagliptin reduced FPG by 20.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) and increased homeostasis model assessment-beta, a marker of beta-cell function, by 12% (p < 0.05) relative to placebo. In patients who underwent a meal tolerance test (n = 134), sitagliptin decreased 2-h post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 36.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) relative to placebo. The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, although there was a higher incidence of overall (60 vs. 47%) and drug-related adverse experiences (AEs) (15 vs. 7%) in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group. This was largely because of a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia AEs (12 vs. 2%, respectively) in the sitagliptin group compared with the placebo group. Body weight modestly increased with sitagliptin relative to placebo (+0.8 vs. -0.4 kg; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sitagliptin 100 mg once daily significantly improved glycaemic control and beta-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with glimepiride or glimepiride plus metformin therapy. The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with a modest increase in hypoglycaemia and body weight, consistent with glimepiride therapy and the observed degree of glycaemic improvement.

23454835|t|Alternariol induces abnormal nuclear morphology and cell cycle arrest in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages.
23454835|a|The mycotoxin alternariol (AOH), a frequent contaminant in fruit and cereal products, is known to induce DNA damage with subsequent cell cycle arrest. Here we elucidated the effects of AOH on stages of cell cycle progression using the RAW 264.7 macrophage model. AOH resulted in an accumulation of cells in the G2/M-phase (4N). Most cells exhibited a large G2 nucleus whereas numbers of true mitotic cells were reduced relative to control. Both cyclin B1 and p-cdc2 levels increased, while cyclin B1 remained in the cytoplasm; suggesting arrest in the G2/M transition point. Remarkably, after exposure to AOH for 24h, most of the cells exhibited abnormally shaped nuclei, as evidenced by partly divided nuclei, nuclear blebs, polyploidy and micronuclei (MN). AOH treatment also induced abnormal Aurora B bridges, suggesting that cytokinesis was interfered within cells undergoing karyokinesis. A minor part of the resultant G1 tetraploid (4N) cells re-entered the S-phase and progressed to 8N cells.

23435942|t|A review on cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease.
23435942|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the deficits in the cholinergic system and deposition of beta amyloid (Ab) in the form of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. Since the cholinergic system plays an important role in the regulation of learning and memory processes, it has been targetted for the design of anti-Alzheimer's drugs. Cholinesterase inhibitors enhance cholinergic transmission directly by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which hydrolyses acetylcholine. Furthermore, it has been also demonstrated that both acetylcholinesterase and butrylcholinesterase (BuChE) play an important role in Ab-aggregation during the early stages of senile plaque formation. Therefore, AChE and BuChE inhibition have been documented as critical targets for the effective management of AD by an increase in the availability of acetylcholine in the brain regions and decrease in the Ab deposition. This review discusses the different classes of cholinesterase inhibitors including tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, xanthostigmine, para-aminobenzoic acid, coumarin, flavonoid, and pyrrolo-isoxazole analogues developed for the treatment of AD.

12046981|t|Pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and clinical properties of olopatadine hydrochloride, a new antiallergic drug.
12046981|a|Olopatadine hydrochloride (olopatadine, 11-[(Z)-3-(dimethylamino)propylidene]-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid monohydrochloride) is a novel antiallergic/histamine H1-receptor antagonistic drug that was synthesized and evaluated in our laboratories. Oral administration of olopatadine at doses of 0.03 mg/kg or higher inhibited the symptoms of experimental allergic skin responses, rhinoconjunctivitis and bronchial asthma in sensitized guinea pigs and rats. Olopatadine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist possessing inhibitory effects on the release of inflammatory lipid mediators such as leukotriene and thromboxane from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils. Olopatadine also inhibited the tachykininergic contraction in the guinea pig bronchi by prejunctional inhibition of peripheral sensory nerves. Olopatadine exerted no significant effects on action potential duration in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, myocardium and human ether-a-go-go-related gene channel. Olopatadine was highly and rapidly absorbed in healthy human volunteers. The urinary excretion of olopatadine accounted for not less than 58% and the contribution of metabolism was considerably low in the clearance of olopatadine in humans. Olopatadine is one of the few renal clearance drugs in antiallergic drugs. Olopatadine was shown to be useful for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria in double-blind clinical trials. Olopatadine was approved in Japan for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria, eczema dermatitis, prurigo, pruritus cutaneous, psoriasis vulgaris and erythema exsudativum multiforme in December, 2000. Ophthalmic solution of olopatadine was also approved in the United States for the treatment of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis in December, 1996 (Appendix: also in the European Union, it was approved in February 2002).

16920841|t|Liver choline dehydrogenase and kidney betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase expression are not affected by methionine or choline intake in growing rats.
16920841|a|Choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) are 2 enzymes involved in choline oxidation. BHMT is expressed at high levels in rat liver and its expression is regulated by dietary Met and choline. BHMT is also found in rat kidney, albeit in substantially lower amounts, but it is not known whether kidney BHMT expression is regulated by dietary Met or choline. Similarly, CHDH activity is highest in the liver and kidney, but the regulation of its expression by diet has not been thoroughly investigated. Sprague Dawley rats ( approximately 50 g) were fed, for 9 d in 2 x 3 factorial design (n = 8), an l-amino acid-defined diet varying in l-Met (0.125, 0.3, or 0.8%) and choline (0 or 25 mmol/kg diet). Liver and kidney BHMT and CHDH were assessed using enzymatic, Western blot, and real-time PCR analyses. Liver samples were also fixed for histological analysis. Liver BHMT activity was 1.3-fold higher in rats fed the Met deficient diet containing choline, which was reflected in corresponding increases in mRNA content and immunodetectable protein. Independent of dietary choline, supplemental Met increased hepatic BHMT activity approximately 30%. Kidney BHMT and liver CHDH expression were refractory to these diets. Some degree of fatty liver developed in all rats fed a choline-devoid diet, indicating that supplemental Met cannot completely compensate for the lack of dietary choline in growing rats.

23220644|t|Optimization of 5-hydroxytryptamines as dual function inhibitors targeting phospholipase A2 and leukotriene A4 hydrolase.
23220644|a|Dual function inhibitors targeting phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and leukotriene A(4) hydrolase (LTA(4)H) may balance the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic network and be used as new anti-inflammatory drugs. In previous study, we discovered multi-target drugs towards the AA metabolic network, among which a dual-target inhibitor (JMC08-4) for human nonpancreatic secretory phospholipase A(2) (hnps-PLA(2)) and human leukotriene A(4) hydrolase (LTA(4)H-h) was found. Based on the structure of compound JMC08-4, new dual-target inhibitors were designed assisted by molecular docking. In this report, a series of 5-hydroxytryptamine compounds were synthesized; and most of these title compounds showed more potent inhibitory activity than compound JMC08-4 in the in vitro bioassay against these two enzymes. The best one inhibited hnps-PLA(2) and LTA(4)H-h with IC(50) values of 9.2 + 0.5 uM and 2.4 + 1.4 uM, respectively.

15563928|t|Preferential and non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors reduce inflammation during lipopolysaccharide-induced synovitis.
15563928|a|Synovitis in horses is frequently treated by administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit cyclooxygenase isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2). Constitutively expressed COX-1 is involved in physiologic functions such as maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity, whereas COX-2 is up-regulated at sites of inflammation. Thus, COX-2 inhibitors reduce inflammation with reduced gastrointestinal side effects as compared to non-selective COX inhibitors. The objective of the present study was to compare the anti-inflammatory effects of the preferential COX-2 inhibitor etodolac with the non-selective COX inhibitor phenylbutazone in horses with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced synovitis. Three groups of horses (n=6) received no treatment, phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg, IV, q12h), or etodolac (23 mg/kg, IV, q12h), respectively, 2-h following injection of LPS into one middle carpal joint. Synovial fluid was analyzed for white blood cell (WBC) count, and TXB2 and PGE2 levels. Phenylbutazone and etodolac significantly reduced WBC count 6 and 24-h following injection of LPS compared to untreated horses. In addition, both drugs significantly reduced PGE2 levels (P<0.05) 6-h following LPS injection, whereas the probable COX-1 prostanoid TXB2 was significantly reduced by phenylbutazone (P<0.05), but not etodolac. Etodolac may serve as a more selective anti-inflammatory agent than phenylbutazone for treatment of equine synovitis.

23628454|t|Scientific evidence for traditional claim of antiobesity activity of Tecomella undulata bark.
23628454|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The bark of Tecomella undulata is traditionally claimed in the treatment of various disease ailments including obesity and cancer. Till now there are no studies about anti obesity activity of Tecomella undulata bark. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was aimed to establish a scientific evidence for anti obesity efficiency of ethyl acetate extract of Tecomella undulata bark (EATUB). Further to standardize the active fractions of EATUB using different biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated activity of EATUB fractions (F1-F7) using 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. Further, F1-mediated effects were characterized by determining mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1, one of the key targets for the treatment of obesity, using semi quantitative RT-PCR (sqRT-PCR) and western blot analysis. The consequences of modulation of SIRT1 on mRNA and protein levels of various adipogenesis mediators like PPARg, C/EBPa, E2F1, leptin, adiponectin and LPL were also studied. In-vivo studies were performed using High Fat Diet (HFD) obese mice. RESULTS: Our data showed that compared to controls, preadipocytes and adipocytes incubated with F1 exhibited a significant decrease in adipogenesis and lipogenesis. In addition, sqRT-PCR and western blot analysis showed significant increase in SIRT1 and adiponectin levels and decrease in PPARg, C/EBPa, E2F1, leptin and LPL levels in preadipocytes and adipocytes. In-vivo studies of F1 in HFD induced obese mice showed significant improvement in lipid profile and glucose levels. The bioactive fraction (F1) was determined to possess 4.95% of ferulic acid. CONCLUSION: Thus, our findings signified the beneficial effects of Tecomella undulata bark in pharmacologic interventions related to obesity and metabolic disorders. Ferulic acid and rutin are being reported and quantified for the first time from the bark of Tecomella undulata.

17597612|t|Impaired antibody synthesis after spinal cord injury is level dependent and is due to sympathetic nervous system dysregulation.
17597612|a|Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are highly susceptible to infection. This post-traumatic immune suppression is thought to occur via alterations in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Normally, the HPA axis and SNS help coordinate proper immune function. After SCI, the HPA axis becomes activated and descending input to sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) is impaired. Because lymphoid organs are innervated by SPNs distributed throughout the thoracolumbar spinal cord, we predicted level-dependent immune suppression after SCI due to activation of the HPA axis and loss of descending input to SPNs. We tested this hypothesis by measuring indices of HPA (circulating corticosterone; CORT) and SNS function (norepinephrine (NE) in spleen) as well as antigen-specific antibody synthesis against an exogenous non-self protein following high- or low-level SCI. Using a mid-thoracic (T9) spinal contusion injury model, we found that CORT was elevated after SCI with aberrant patterns of diurnal CORT synthesis evident through at least the first 24 h post-injury. However, splenic NE and antibody synthesis were similar to uninjured controls. Injury severity did not change these parameters. Indeed, CORT, NE and antibody synthesis were similar after T9 contusion or transection SCI. In contrast, high-level SCI (T3) caused sustained increases in CORT and splenic NE along with impaired antibody synthesis and elevated splenocyte apoptosis. The immunosuppressive effects of T3 SCI were caused by NE acting at beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2AR) and could be reversed using beta2AR blockers. Interestingly, impaired antibody after T3 SCI could be mimicked after T9 SCI with a beta2AR agonist. These data illustrate the immunosuppressive effects of the SNS after high-level SCI and indicate that immune deficits may be overcome using beta-blockers.

23552263|t|Lipoxygenase and urease inhibition of the aerial parts of the Polygonatum verticillatum.
23552263|a|Over expression of lipoxygenase (LOX) and urease has already contributed to the pathology of different human disease. Targeting the inhibition of these enzymes has proved great clinical utility. The aim of the present study was to scrutinised the inhibitory profile of the aerial parts of the Polygonatum verticillatum enzyme against LOX, urease, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) using standard experimental protocols. When checked against lipoxygenase, the extracts revealed significant attenuation. Of the tested extracts, the ethyl acetate fraction was the most potent (half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50): 97 ug/mL) followed by aqueous fraction IC50: 109 ug/mL). Regarding urease inhibition, n-butanol was the most potent fraction (IC50: 97 ug/mL). However, the extracts did not show significant inhibition on AChE and BChE. In the preliminary phytochemical tests, the aerial parts of the plant showed the presence of saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, tannins and terpenoids. The current findings could be attributed to these groups of compounds.

12392782|t|Cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors protect against mononuclear phagocyte neurotoxicity.
12392782|a|Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are believed to be contributing factors to neurodegeneration in normal aging, as well as in age-related neurological disorders. Reactive microglia are found in increased numbers in aging brain and are prominently associated with lesions in such age-related degenerative conditions as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In vitro, stimulated microglia or microglial-like cells secrete neurotoxic materials and are generators of free radicals through their respiratory burst system. Agents that suppress microglial activation are therefore candidates for neuroprotection. We have developed quantitative in vitro assays for measuring neurotoxicity of microglia or other mononuclear phagocytes. Neuronal like SH-SY5Y cells are cultured in supernatants from activated cells of the human monocytic THP-1 line and their survival is followed. Respiratory burst is directly measured on the activated cells. We tested inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase (COX) or the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathways as possible neuroprotective agents. The COX pathway generates inflammatory prostaglandins, while the 5-LOX pathway generates inflammatory leukotrienes. We found that inhibitors of both these pathways suppressed neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion. They included the COX-1 inhibitor indomethacin; the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398; the mixed COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor ibuprofen; the nitric oxide (NO) derivatives of indomethacin, ibuprofen and flurbiprofen; the 5-LOX inhibitor REV 5901; and the 5-LOX activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor MK-886. The FLAP inhibitor also reduced respiratory burst activity in a more potent manner than indomethacin. Combinations of COX and 5-LOX inhibitors were more effective than single inhibitors. The data suggest that both COX inhibitors and 5-LOX inhibitors may be neuroprotective in vivo by suppressing toxic actions of microglia/macrophages, and that combinations of the two might have greater therapeutic potential than single inhibitors of either class.

23641914|t|Copolymerization of 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane and glycidyl methacrylate, a well-defined and efficient process for achieving functionalized polyesters for covalent binding of bioactive molecules.
23641914|a|The understanding of cell-material interactions is important for creating personalized implants for tissue engineering. This has resulted in an interest in developing polymers with functional groups with the possibility of controlling the macromolecular surface. We have in a one-pot reaction synthesized a series of amorphous and degradable polyester-based copolymers with active functional groups by copolymerization of 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane and glycidyl methacrylate. The properties of the final polymers were varied by varying the feed ratios of the monomers and it was seen that it was possible to control the amount of active functional groups. The resulting epoxy-functionalized polyester was further modified by covalent immobilization of heparin. The heparinization was done in order, in a future aspect, to enhance the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Heparin binds directly with the growth factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 and helps to retain its activity. The molecular structure of the copolymers was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, size exclusion chromatography, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry and tensile testing showed that the monomer feed ratio had a great influence on the properties of the final polymer and that it thus was possible to control the mechanical properties to suit an intended application. The presence of heparin was verified by toluidine blue staining and all the films tested showed positive signals for heparin.

12112047|t|Minocycline markedly protects the neonatal brain against hypoxic-ischemic injury.
12112047|a|Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the perinatal period is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Presently, there are no proven effective therapies with which to safeguard the human neonatal brain against this type of injury. Minocycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline, has been shown to be neuroprotective in certain adult ischemic injury/stroke and neurodegenerative disease models. However, minocycline's neuroprotective effects have not been assessed after insults to the neonatal brain. We now report that minocycline administered either immediately before or immediately after a hypoxic-ischemic insult substantially blocks tissue damage in a rodent model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Minocycline treatment prevents the formation of activated caspase-3, a known effector of apoptosis, as well as the appearance of a calpain cleaved substrate, a marker of excitotoxic/necrotic cell death. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a systemic treatment that can be administered after a hypoxic-ischemic insult, which provides robust, nearly complete neuroprotection to the developing brain. Our data suggest that minocycline or a related neuroprotective tetracycline may be a candidate to consider in human clinical trials to protect the developing brain against hypoxic-ischemic-induced damage.

23409765|t|Impact of quaternary structure dynamics on allosteric drug discovery.
23409765|a|The morpheein model of allosteric regulation draws attention to proteins that can exist as an equilibrium of functionally distinct assemblies where: one subunit conformation assembles into one multimer; a different subunit conformation assembles into a different multimer; and the various multimers are in a dynamic equilibrium whose position can be modulated by ligands that bind to a multimer-specific ligand binding site. The case study of porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) illustrates how such an equilibrium holds lessons for disease mechanisms, drug discovery, understanding drug side effects, and identifying proteins wherein drug discovery efforts might focus on quaternary structure dynamics. The morpheein model of allostery has been proposed as applicable for a wide assortment of disease-associated proteins (Selwood, T., Jaffe, E., (2012) Arch. Bioch. Biophys, 519:131-143). Herein we discuss quaternary structure dynamics aspects to drug discovery for the disease-associated putative morpheeins phenylalanine hydroxylase, HIV integrase, pyruvate kinase, and tumor necrosis factor a. Also highlighted is the quaternary structure equilibrium of transthyretin and successful drug discovery efforts focused on controlling its quaternary structure dynamics.

12699699|a|The YLR205c gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not show significant sequence identity to any known gene, except for heme oxygenase (22% to human HO-1). The YLR205 ORF was cloned and overexpressed in both Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae. Both expression systems yielded proteins that bound heme tightly. The isolated YLR205c protein underwent reduction in the presence of either NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase or NADH-putidaredoxin-putidaredoxin reductase but did not exhibit heme oxygenase activity. The protein exhibited modest H(2)O(2)-dependent peroxidase activities with guaiacol, potassium iodide, and 2,2(')-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS). Thus, YLR205c codes for a hemoprotein of unknown physiological function that exhibits peroxidase activity.

17658513|t|Expressions and mechanical functions of alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes in hamster ureter.
17658513|a|We characterized the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes in hamster ureters according to gene and protein expressions and contractile function. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to determine mRNA levels and receptor protein expressions respectively, for alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors in hamster ureteral smooth muscle. alpha(1)-Adrenoceptor antagonists were tested against the phenylephrine (alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist)-induced contraction in isolated hamster ureteral preparations using a functional experimental approach. In the smooth muscle, relative mRNA expression levels for alpha(1a)-, alpha(1b)- and alpha(1d)-adrenoceptors were 10.7%, 1.2% and 88.1%, respectively, and protein expressions were identified for alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors immunohistochemically. Noradrenaline and phenylephrine (alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist) each produced a concentration-dependent tonic contraction, their pD(2) values being 6.87+/-0.08 and 6.10+/-0.05, respectively. Prazosin (nonselective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist), silodosin (selective alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonist) and BMY-7378 (8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione dihydrochloride) (selective alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist) competitively antagonized the phenylephrine-induced contraction (pA(2) values, 8.60+/-0.07, 9.44+/-0.06 and 5.75+/-0.07, respectively). Chloroethylclonidine (3x10(-6) mol/L or more) produced a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve for phenylephrine. Thus, in hamster ureters, alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors were more prevalent than the alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor, with contraction being mediated mainly via alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors. If these findings hold true for humans, alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonists could become useful medication for stone passage in urolithiasis patients.

23296837|t|Neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of a coffee component in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease.
23296837|a|Consumption of coffee is associated with reduced risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), an effect that has largely been attributed to caffeine. However, coffee contains numerous components that may also be neuroprotective. One of these compounds is eicosanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamide (EHT), which ameliorates the phenotype of a-synuclein transgenic mice associated with decreased protein aggregation and phosphorylation, improved neuronal integrity and reduced neuroinflammation. Here, we sought to investigate if EHT has an effect in the MPTP model of PD. Mice fed a diet containing EHT for four weeks exhibited dose-dependent preservation of nigral dopaminergic neurons following MPTP challenge compared to animals given control feed. Reductions in striatal dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase content were also less pronounced with EHT treatment. The neuroinflammatory response to MPTP was markedly attenuated, and indices of oxidative stress and JNK activation were significantly prevented with EHT. In cultured primary microglia and astrocytes, EHT had a direct anti-inflammatory effect demonstrated by repression of lipopolysaccharide-induced NFkB activation, iNOS induction, and nitric oxide production. EHT also exhibited a robust anti-oxidant activity in vitro. Additionally, in SH-SY5Y cells, MPP(+)-induced demethylation of phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), the master regulator of the cellular phosphoregulatory network, and cytotoxicity were ameliorated by EHT. These findings indicate that the neuroprotective effect of EHT against MPTP is through several mechanisms including its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities as well as its ability to modulate the methylation and hence activity of PP2A. Our data, therefore, reveal a strong beneficial effect of a novel component of coffee in multiple endpoints relevant to PD.

23570998|t|Assessment of the role of flavonoids for inducing osteoblast differentiation in isolated mouse bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells.
23570998|a|Quercetin and rutin are common flavonoids in fruit and vegetables, and have been reported to affect bone development. However, the effect of flavonoids on osteoblast differentiation remains a matter of controversy. In the present study, mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) were isolated and characterized for their use in osteoblast differentiation using two flavonoids, quercetin and rutin. BMMSCs were cultured in various concentrations of quercetin and rutin during the osteoblast differentiation period of 10 days. Both quercetin and rutin were found to up regulate the osteoblast differentiation in dose dependent manner, albeit to lesser extent in case of former than that of latter. Quercetin and rutin also increased alkaline phosphatase activity by about 150 and 240% and demonstrated mineralization up to 110 and 200% respectively as compared to control (which was considered as 100%). Further, both the flavonoids were also found to increase the expression of some of the prominent markers for differentiation of osteoblast like osteopontin, osterix, RunX2, osteoprotegerin and osteocalcin. The current data suggests that certain classes of flavonoids like rutin and quercetin can be used in the cure and management of osteodegenerative disorders due to their osteoblast specific differentiation activities.

23116965|t|Antiarrhythmic effects of (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate, a novel sodium channel agonist in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes.
23116965|a|(-)-Epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), a polyphenol extracted from green tea, has been proposed as an effective compound for improving cardiac contractility. However, the therapeutic potential of ECG on the treatment of arrhythmia remains unknown. We investigated the direct actions of ECG on the modulation of ion currents and cardiac cell excitability in the primary culture of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM), which is considered a hypertrophic model for analysis of myocardial arrhythmias. By using the whole-cell patch-clamp configurations, we found ECG enhanced the slowly inactivating component of voltage-gated Na(+) currents (I(Na)) in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1-100 uM) with an EC(50) value of 3.8 uM. ECG not only shifted the current-voltage relationship of peak I(Na) to the hyperpolarizing direction but also accelerated I(Na) recovery kinetics. Working at a concentration level of I(Na) enhancement, ECG has no notable effect on voltage-gated K(+) currents and L-type Ca(2+) currents. With culture time increment, the firing rate of spontaneous action potential (sAP) in NRVMs was gradually decreased until spontaneous early after-depolarization (EAD) was observed after about one week culture. ECG increased the firing rate of normal sAP about two-fold without waveform alteration. Interestingly, the bradycardia-dependent EAD could be significantly restored by ECG in fast firing rate to normal sAP waveform. The expression of dominant cardiac sodium channel subunit, Nav1.5, was consistently detected throughout the culture periods. Our results reveal how ECG, the novel I(Na) agonist, may act as a promising candidate in clinical applications on cardiac arrhythmias.

23159888|t|Analysis of mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5): characterisation of rat ADH5 with comparisons to the corresponding human variant.
23159888|a|Alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5) is a member of the mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase family of yet undefined functions. ADH5 was first identified at the DNA level in human and deer mouse. A rat alcohol dehydrogenase structure of similar type has been isolated at the cDNA level using human ADH5 as a screening probe, where the rat cDNA structure displayed several atypical properties. mRNA for rat ADH5 was found in multiple tissues, especially in the kidney. In vitro translation experiments indicated that rat ADH5 is expressed as efficiently as ADH1 and furthermore, rat ADH5 was readily expressed in COS cells fused to Green Fluorescent Protein. However, no soluble ADH5 protein could be heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli cells with expression systems successfully used for other mammalian ADHs, including fused to glutathione-S-transferase. Molecular modelling of the enzyme indicated that the protein does not fold in a productive way, which can be the explanation why no stable and active ADH5 has been isolated. These results indicate that ADH5, while readily expressed at the mRNA level, does not behave similarly to other mammalian ADHs investigated. The results, in vitro and in silico, suggest an unstable ADH5 structure, which can explain for why no active and stable protein can be isolated. Further possibilities are conceivable: the ADH5 protein may have to interact with a stabiliser, or the gene is actually a pseudogene.

19039322|t|Global target profile of the kinase inhibitor bosutinib in primary chronic myeloid leukemia cells.
19039322|a|The detailed molecular mechanism of action of second-generation BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including perturbed targets and pathways, should contribute to rationalized therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or in other affected diseases. Here, we characterized the target profile of the dual SRC/ABL inhibitor bosutinib employing a two-tiered approach using chemical proteomics to identify natural binders in whole cell lysates of primary CML and K562 cells in parallel to in vitro kinase assays against a large recombinant kinase panel. The combined strategy resulted in a global survey of bosutinib targets comprised of over 45 novel tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. We have found clear differences in the target patterns of bosutinib in primary CML cells versus the K562 cell line. A comparison of bosutinib with dasatinib across the whole kinase panel revealed overlapping, but distinct, inhibition profiles. Common among those were the SRC, ABL and TEC family kinases. Bosutinib did not inhibit KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor, but prominently targeted the apoptosis-linked STE20 kinases. Although in vivo bosutinib is inactive against ABL T315I, we found this clinically important mutant to be enzymatically inhibited in the mid-nanomolar range. Finally, bosutinib is the first kinase inhibitor shown to target CAMK2G, recently implicated in myeloid leukemia cell proliferation.

18308814|t|Asenapine: a novel psychopharmacologic agent with a unique human receptor signature.
18308814|a|Asenapine is a novel psychopharmacologic agent under development for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We determined and compared the human receptor binding affinities and functional characteristics of asenapine and several antipsychotic drugs. Compounds were tested under comparable assay conditions using cloned human receptors. In comparison with the antipsychotics, asenapine showed high affinity and a different rank order of binding affinities (pKi) for serotonin receptors (5-HT1A [8.6], 5-HT1B [8.4], 5-HT2A [10.2], 5-HT2B [9.8], 5-HT2C [10.5], 5-HT5 [8.8], 5-HT6 [9.6] and 5-HT7 [9.9]), adrenoceptors (alpha1 [8.9], alpha2A [8.9], alpha2B [9.5] and alpha2C [8.9]), dopamine receptors (D1 [8.9], D2 [8.9], D3 [9.4] and D4 [9.0]) and histamine receptors (H1 [9.0] and H2 [8.2]). It had much lower affinity (pKi<or=5) for muscarinic receptors and was the only agent with affinity for H2 receptors. Relative to its D2 receptor affinity, asenapine had a higher affinity for 5-HT2C, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT7, 5-HT6, alpha2B and D3 receptors, suggesting stronger engagement of these targets at therapeutic doses. Asenapine behaved as a potent antagonist (pKB) at 5-HT1A (7.4), 5-HT1B (8.1), 5-HT2A (9.0), 5-HT2B (9.3), 5-HT2C (9.0), 5-HT6 (8.0), 5-HT7 (8.5), D2 (9.1), D3 (9.1), alpha2A (7.3), alpha2B (8.3), alpha2C (6.8) and H1 (8.4) receptors. These functional effects differed from those of risperidone (pKB<5 for 5-HT6) and olanzapine (pKB<5 for 5-HT1A and alpha2). Our results indicate that asenapine has a unique human receptor signature, with binding affinity and antagonistic properties that differ appreciably from those of antipsychotic drugs.

17229632|t|The ability of sorafenib to inhibit oncogenic PDGFRbeta and FLT3 mutants and overcome resistance to other small molecule inhibitors.
17229632|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Activated tyrosine kinases are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute leukemia, and represent attractive targets for therapy. Sorafenib (BAY43-9006, Nexavar) is a small molecule B-RAF inhibitor that is used for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, and has been shown to have activity against receptor tyrosine kinases from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) families. We investigated the efficacy of sorafenib at inhibiting mutants of the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGFRbeta, KIT, and FLT3, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. DESIGN AND METHODS: We tested the effect of sorafenib on the proliferation of hematopoietic cells transformed by ETV6-PDGFRbeta, FLT3 with an internal tandem duplication or D835Y point mutation, and the KIT(D816V) mutant. The direct effect of sorafenib on the activity of these kinases and their downstream signaling was tested using phospho-specific antibodies. RESULTS: We show that sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of ETV6-PDGFRbeta and FLT3 mutants, including some of the mutants that confer resistance to PKC412 and other FLT3 inhibitors. Sorafenib induced a cell cycle block and apoptosis in the acute myeloid leukemia cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-13, both expressing FLT3 with an internal tandem duplication, whereas no effect was observed on four other acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. The imatinib-resistant KIT(D816V) mutant, associated with systemic mastocytosis, was found to be resistant to sorafenib. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results warrant further clinical studies of sorafenib for the treatment of myeloid malignancies expressing activated forms of PDGFRbeta and FLT3.

23506741|t|A novel benzo[d]imidazole derivate prevents the development of dextran sulfate sodium-induced murine experimental colitis via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.
23506741|a|NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported to be associated with various kinds of immunological diseases including colitis. However, there are few drug candidates targeting inflammasomes for the treatment of colitis. In the present study, we aimed at examining the effect of 1-ethyl-5-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole, a synthetic small molecular compound also named Fc11a-2, for the treatment of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in mice via targeting NLRP3 inflammasome. Treatment with Fc11a-2 dose-dependently attenuated the loss of body weight and shortening of colon length induced by DSS. In addition, the disease activity index, histopathologic scores and myeloperoxidase activity were also significantly reduced by Fc11a-2 treatment. Moreover, protein and mRNA levels of DSS-induced proinflammatory cytokines in colon, including TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-18, IL-17A and IFN-g, were markedly suppressed by Fc11a-2. Furthermore, a decreased CD11c(+) macrophage infiltration in colons and inactivation of caspase-1 in peritoneal macrophages were detected in Fc11a-2-treated mice. The mechanism of action of Fc11a-2 was related to the inhibition of the cleavage of pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1b and pro-IL-18 which in turn suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, our results demonstrate the ability of Fc11a-2 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its potential use in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.

15049511|t|Inhibitory effects of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
15049511|a|1. The inhibitory effects of tranylcypromine, a nonselective irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), on three cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, namely CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, have been evaluated in vitro. 2. The studies were conducted using cDNA-expressed human CYP enzymes and probe substrates. 3. A range of substrate concentrations was coincubated with a range of tranylcypromine concentrations in the presence of each of the CYP enzymes at 37 degrees C for a predetermined period of time. Product concentrations were quantified by HPLC with UV detection. 4. The results demonstrated that tranylcypromine is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C19 (Ki = 32 microM) and CYP2D6 (Ki = 367 microM) and a noncompetitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 (Ki = 56 microM). 5. None of these inhibitory effects are considered clinically significant at usual therapeutic doses. However, in certain situations such as high dose tranylcypromine therapy, or in poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 substrates, clinically significant interactions might occur, particularly when tranylcypromine is coadministered with drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.

23618921|t|Concurrent Regulation of the Transcription Factors Nrf2 and ATF4 Mediates the Enhancement of Glutathione Levels by the Flavonoid Fisetin.
23618921|a|Glutathione (GSH) and GSH-associated metabolism provide the major line of defense for the protection of cells from various forms of toxic stress. GSH also plays a key role in regulating the intracellular redox environment. Thus, maintenance of GSH levels is developing into an important therapeutic objective for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Among the transcription factors that play critical roles in GSH metabolism are NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Thus, compounds that can upregulate these transcription factors may be particularly useful as treatment options through their effects on GSH metabolism. We previously showed that the flavonoid fisetin not only increases basal levels of GSH but also maintains GSH levels under oxidative stress conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects have remained unknown until now. Here we show that fisetin rapidly increases the levels of both Nrf2 and ATF4 as well as Nrf2- and ATF4-dependent gene transcription via distinct mechanisms. Although fisetin greatly increases the stability of both Nrf2 and ATF4, only the effect on ATF4 is dependent on protein kinase activity. Using siRNA we found that ATF4, but not Nrf2, is important for fisetin's ability to increase GSH levels under basal conditions whereas both ATF4 and Nrf2 appear to cooperate to increase GSH levels under oxidative stress conditions. Based upon these results, we hypothesize that compounds able to increase GSH levels via multiple mechanisms, such as fisetin, will be particularly effective for maintaining GSH levels under a variety of different stresses.

11792932|t|Aromatase inhibitors for male infertility.
11792932|a|PURPOSE: Testosterone-to-estradiol ratio levels in infertile men improve during treatment with the aromatase inhibitor, testolactone, and resulting changes in semen parameters. We evaluated the effect of anastrozole, a more selective aromatase inhibitor, on the hormonal and semen profiles of infertile men with abnormal baseline testosterone-to-estradiol ratios. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 140 subfertile men with abnormal testosterone-to-estradiol ratios were treated with 100 to 200 mg. testolactone daily or 1 mg. anastrozole daily. Changes in testosterone, estradiol, testosterone-to-estradiol ratios and semen parameters were evaluated during therapy. The effect of obesity, diagnosis of the Klinefelter syndrome, and presence of varicocele and/or history of varicocele repair on treatment results was studied. RESULTS: Men treated with testolactone had an increase in testosterone-to-estradiol ratios during therapy (mean plus or minus standard error of the mean 5.3 +/- 0.2 versus 12.4 +/- 1.1, p <0.001). This change was confirmed in subgroups of men with the Klinefelter syndrome, a history of varicocele repair and those with varicocele. A total of 12 oligospermic men had semen analysis before and during testolactone treatment with an increase in sperm concentration (5.5 versus 11.2 million sperm per ml., p <0.01), motility (14.7% versus 21.0%, p <0.05), morphology (6.5% versus 12.8%, p = 0.05), and motility index (606.3 versus 1685.2 million motile sperm per ejaculate, respectively, p <0.05) appreciated. During anastrozole treatment, similar changes in the testosterone-to-estradiol ratios were seen (7.2 +/- 0.3 versus 18.1 +/- 1.0, respectively, p <0.001). This improvement of hormonal parameters was noted for all subgroups except those patients with the Klinefelter syndrome. A total of 25 oligospermic men with semen analysis before and during anastrozole treatment had an increase in semen volume (2.9 versus 3.5 ml., p <0.05), sperm concentration (5.5 versus 15.6 million sperm per ml., p <0.001) and motility index (832.8 versus 2930.8 million motile sperm per ejaculate, respectively, p <0.005). These changes were similar to those observed in men treated with testolactone. No significant difference in serum testosterone levels during treatment with testolactone and anastrozole was observed. However, the anastrozole treatment group did have a statistically better improvement of serum estradiol concentration and testosterone-to-estradiol ratios (p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Men who are infertile with a low serum testosterone-to-estradiol ratio can be treated with an aromatase inhibitor. With treatment, an increase in testosterone-to-estradiol ratio occurred in association with increased semen parameters. Anastrozole and testolactone have similar effects on hormonal profiles and semen analysis. Anastrazole appears to be at least as effective as testolactone for treating men with abnormal testosterone-to-estradiol ratios, except for the subset with the Klinefelter syndrome, who appeared to be more effectively treated with testolactone.

15177307|t|No influence of moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of lumiracoxib, an oral COX-2 selective inhibitor.
15177307|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the novel cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor lumiracoxib (Prexige), so that dose recommendations for clinical use can be provided. This was an open-label, single dose, case-controlled study in which eight subjects with liver cirrhosis classed as moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7-9) and eight demographically-matched healthy subjects received a single oral 400 mg dose of lumiracoxib. Routine safety assessments were made and blood samples were taken for determination of lumiracoxib concentrations for 96 h post dose. The ex vivo binding of lumiracoxib to plasma proteins was determined pre dose and at 2 and 12 h post dose. An analysis of variance was used to detect differences in PK parameters (AUC, Cmax and Tmax) between the treatment groups. There were no significant differences between subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency and healthy subjects in the area under the lumiracoxib plasma concentration-time curves (AUC(0-infinity)): 29.2 +/- 6.7 microg h ml(-1) versus 28.7 +/- 6.3 mircrog h ml(-1). The rate of absorption of lumiracoxib was not significantly altered by hepatic impairment based on Cmax and Tmax. The protein-bound fraction of lumiracoxib exceeded 98% both in healthy control subjects and in those with moderate hepatic insufficiency. A single dose of 400 mg lumiracoxib was well tolerated. In conclusion, no dose adjustments appear to be required when lumiracoxib is administered to patients with either mild or moderate hepatic impairment.

11351021|t|Functional consequences of the arrhythmogenic G306R KvLQT1 K+ channel mutant probed by viral gene transfer in cardiomyocytes.
11351021|a|IKs, the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, figures prominently in the repolarization of heart cells. The K+ channel gene KvLQT1 is mutated in the heritable long QT (LQT) syndrome. Heterologous coexpression of KvLQT1 and the accessory protein minK yields an IKs-like current. Nevertheless, the links between KvLQT1 and cardiac IKs are largely inferential. Since the LQT syndrome mutant KvLQT1-G306R suppresses channel activity when coexpressed with wild-type KvLQT1 in a heterologous system, overexpression of this mutant in cardiomyocytes should reduce or eliminate native IKs if KvLQT1 is indeed the major molecular component of this current. To test this idea, we created the adenovirus AdRMGI-KvLQT1-G306R, which overexpresses KvLQT1-G306R channels. In > 60 % of neonatal mouse myocytes, a sizable IKs could be measured using perforated-patch recordings (8.0 +/- 1.6 pA pF-1, n = 13). IKs was increased by forskolin and blocked by clofilium or indapamide but not by E-4031. While cells infected with a reporter virus expressing only green fluorescent protein (GFP) displayed IKs similar to that in uninfected cells, AdRMGI-KvLQT1-G306R-infected cells showed a significantly reduced IKs (2.4 +/- 1.1 pA pF-1, n = 10, P < 0.01) when measured 60-72 h after infection. Similar results were observed in adult guinea-pig myocytes (5.9 +/- 1.2 pA pF-1, n = 9, for control vs. 0.1 +/- 0.1 pA pF-1, n = 5, for AdRMGI-KvLQT1-G306R-infected cells). We conclude that KvLQT1 is the major molecular component of IKs. Our results further establish a dominant-negative mechanism for the G306R LQT syndrome mutation.

23358194|t|Transcriptome alterations following developmental atrazine exposure in zebrafish are associated with disruption of neuroendocrine and reproductive system function, cell cycle, and carcinogenesis.
23358194|a|Atrazine, a herbicide commonly applied to agricultural areas and a common contaminant of potable water supplies, is implicated as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) and potential carcinogen. Studies show that EDCs can cause irreversible changes in tissue formation, decreased reproductive potential, obesity, and cancer. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers an atrazine concentration of < 3 ppb in drinking water safe for consumption. The specific adverse human health effects associated with a developmental atrazine exposure and the underlying genetic mechanisms of these effects are not well defined. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a range of atrazine concentrations to establish toxicity. Morphological, transcriptomic, and protein alterations were then assessed at 72h postfertilization following developmental atrazine exposure at 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb. A significant increase in head length was observed in all three atrazine treatments. Transcriptomic profiles revealed 21, 62, and 64 genes with altered expression in the 0.3, 3, and 30 ppb atrazine treatments, respectively. Altered genes were associated with neuroendocrine and reproductive system development, function, and disease; cell cycle control; and carcinogenesis. There was a significant overlap (42 genes) between the 3 and 30 ppb differentially expressed gene lists, with two of these genes (CYP17A1 and SAMHD1) present in all three atrazine treatments. Increased transcript levels were translated to significant upregulation in protein expression. Overall, this study identifies genetic and molecular targets altered in response to a developmental atrazine exposure to further define the biological pathways and mechanisms of toxicity.

23389043|t|Oxidative Stress and DNA Damage in Human Gastric Carcinoma: 8-Oxo-7'8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) as a Possible Tumor Marker.
23389043|a|We characterized the oxidative stress (OS) status by the levels of reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), malondialdehyde (MDA) and the mutagenic base 8-oxo-7'8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) in human gastric carcinoma (HGC) samples and compared the results with normal tissue from the same patients. We also analyzed 8-oxo-dG in peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNC) and urine from healthy control subjects and in affected patients in the basal state and one, three, six, nine and twelve months after tumor resection. The levels of DNA repair enzyme mRNA expression (hOGG1, RAD51, MUYTH and MTH1) were determined in tumor specimens and compared with normal mucosa. Tumor specimens exhibited increased levels of MDA and 8-oxo-dG compared with normal gastric tissue. GSH levels were also increased, while GSSG levels remained stable. DNA repair enzyme mRNA expression was induced in the tumor tissues. Levels of 8-oxo-dG were significantly elevated in both urine and PMNC of gastric cancer patients compared with healthy controls. After gastrectomy, the levels of the damaged base in urine and PMNC decreased progressively to values close to those found in the healthy population. The high levels of 8-oxo-dG in urine may be related to the increased induction of DNA repair activity in tumor tissue, and the changes observed after tumor resection support its potential use as a tumor marker.

22923473|t|Liver glycogen loading dampens glycogen synthesis seen in response to either hyperinsulinemia or intraportal glucose infusion.
22923473|a|The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of liver glycogen loading on net hepatic glycogen synthesis during hyperinsulinemia or hepatic portal vein glucose infusion in vivo. Liver glycogen levels were supercompensated (SCGly) in two groups (using intraportal fructose infusion) but not in two others (Gly) during hyperglycemic-normoinsulinemia. Following a 2-h control period during which fructose infusion was stopped, there was a 2-h experimental period in which the response to hyperglycemia plus either 4x basal insulin (INS) or portal vein glucose infusion (PoG) was measured. Increased hepatic glycogen reduced the percent of glucose taken up by the liver that was deposited in glycogen (74 + 3 vs. 53 + 5% in Gly+INS and SCGly+INS, respectively, and 72 + 3 vs. 50 + 6% in Gly+PoG and SCGly+PoG, respectively). The reduction in liver glycogen synthesis in SCGly+INS was accompanied by a decrease in both insulin signaling and an increase in AMPK activation, whereas only the latter was observed in SCGly+PoG. These data indicate that liver glycogen loading impairs glycogen synthesis regardless of the signal used to stimulate it.

23296102|t|Acrolein induces Alzheimer's disease-like pathologies in vitro and in vivo.
23296102|a|The pathologic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been fully uncovered. Acrolein, a ubiquitous dietary pollutant and by-product of oxidative stress, can induce cytotoxicity in neurons, which might play an important role in the etiology of AD. Here, we examined the effects of Acrolein on the AD pathologies in vitro and in vivo. We found Acrolein induced HT22 cells death in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Interestingly, Acrolein increased proteins' levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), b-secretase (BACE-1) and the amyloid b-peptide transporter receptor for advanced glycation end products, and decreased A-disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 10 levels. In vivo, chronic oral exposure to Acrolein (2.5 mg/kg/day by intragastric gavage for 8 weeks) induced mild cognitive declination and pyknosis/atrophy of hippocampal neurons. The activity of superoxide dismutase was down-regulated while the level of malondialdehyde was up-regulated in rat brain. Moreover, Acrolein resulted in activation of astrocytes, up-regulation of BACE-1 in cortex and down-regulation of ADAM-10 in hippocampus and cortex. Taken together, our findings suggest that exposure to Acrolein induces AD-like pathology in vitro and in vivo. Scavenging Acrolein might be beneficial for the therapy of AD.

1730582|t|Mechanism of the irreversible inactivation of mouse ornithine decarboxylase by alpha-difluoromethylornithine. Characterization of sequences at the inhibitor and coenzyme binding sites.
1730582|a|Mouse ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant enzyme used for determination of the binding site for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and of the residues modified in the inactivation of the enzyme by the enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding lysine in mouse ODC was identified as lysine 69 of the mouse sequence by reduction of the purified holoenzyme form with NaB[3H]4 followed by digestion of the carboxymethylated protein with endoproteinase Lys-C, radioactive peptide mapping using reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and gas-phase peptide sequencing. This lysine is contained in the sequence PFYAVKC, which is found in all known ODCs from eukaryotes. The preceding amino acids do not conform to the consensus sequence of SXHK, which contains the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding lysine in a number of other decarboxylases including ODCs from E. coli. Using a similar procedure to analyze ODC labeled by reaction with [5-14C]DFMO, it was found that lysine 69 and cysteine 360 formed covalent adducts with the inhibitor. Cysteine 360, which was the major adduct accounting for about 90% of the total labeling, is contained within the sequence -WGPTCDGL(I)D-, which is present in all known eukaryote ODCs. These results provide strong evidence that these two peptides form essential parts of the catalytic site of ODC. Analysis by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides containing the DFMO-cysteine adduct indicated that the adduct formed in the enzyme was probably the cyclic imine S-(2-(1-pyrroline)methyl)cysteine. This is readily oxidized to S-((2-pyrrole)methyl)cysteine or converted to S-((2-pyrrolidine)methyl)cysteine by NaBH4 reduction. This adduct is consistent with spectral evidence showing that inactivation of the enzyme with DFMO does not entail the formation of a stable adduct between the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the enzyme, and the inhibitor.

23545458|t|Total saponins of Panax notoginseng enhance VEGF and relative receptors signals and promote angiogenesis derived from rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.
23545458|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Total saponins of Panax notoginseng (tPNS), main constituents extracted from Panax Notoginseng, a highly valued traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to increase protein expression and the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The effects of tPNS on angiogenesis were studied in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: rBMSCs were stimulated by tPNS of 48h. The mRNA expression levels of VEGF-A, Flt-1 and Kdr in rBMSCs were determined by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). rBMSCs were induced to differentiate into endothelial-like cells and the effects of tPNS on the angiogenesis ability of rBMSCs and rBMSCs after endothelial differentiation were assayed by a Matrigel model in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: tPNS (100ug/ml) significantly enhanced the mRNA expression level of VEGF-A and Kdr compared to the control group, while they had no obvious effect on the expression of Flt-1. tPNS (1ug/ml and 100ug/ml) significantly increased capillary network forming of rBMSCs after endothelial differentiation in Matrigel in vitro. tPNS (50ug/kg, 100ug/kg and 150ug/kg) also significantly increased angiogenesis induced by the combination with implantation of rBMSCs and Matrigel in vivo. CONCLUSION: tPNS up-regulate VEGF-A and Kdr expression, and promote angiogenesis in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.

7599160|t|The dynamics of cobalamin utilization in L-1210 mouse leukemia cells: a model of cellular cobalamin metabolism.
7599160|a|The uptake and metabolism of cobalamin (Cbl) has been studied in L-1210 murine leukemia cells propagating in vitro. Extracellular Cbl (protein bound and free) and intracellular Cbl (protein bound and free) were determined after culturing L-1210 cells in the presence of [57Co]cyanocobalamin (CN-Cbl) bound to transcobalamin II (transcobalamin, TC). The intracellular pool of free [57Co]Cbl increased during the first 24 h of culture and a substantial fraction of this free pool was effluxed from the cell to the medium. Upon depletion of extracellular TC-[57Co]CN-Cbl, the intracellular concentration of free Cbl decreased as did the efflux of Cbl to the medium. Internalized [57Co]CN-Cbl was converted to hydroxocobalamin (OH-Cbl), methylcobalamin (Me-Cbl) and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. These Cbl forms were found in both soluble (cytoplasmic) and insoluble (membrane) fractions. Intracellular protein-bound [57Co]Cbl fractionated with methionine synthase (MS) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MU) activity. The major form of Cbl associated with the two enzymes was OH-Cbl. Cells propagated in medium containing N5-methyltetrahydrofolate and homocysteine showed a substantial increase in MS activity which paralleled the increase in the intracellular concentration of Me-Cbl and the Cbl bound to the enzyme.

11861820|t|Methylenedioxymethamphetamine decreases plasmalemmal and vesicular dopamine transport: mechanisms and implications for neurotoxicity.
11861820|a|Administration of a high-dose regimen of methamphetamine (METH) rapidly and profoundly decreases plasmalemmal and vesicular dopamine (DA) transport in the striatum, as assessed in synaptosomes and purified vesicles, respectively. To determine whether these responses were common to other amphetamines of abuse, effects of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on the plasmalemmal DA transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) were assessed. Similar to effects of METH reported previously, multiple high-dose MDMA administrations rapidly (within 1 h) decreased plasmalemmal DA uptake, as assessed ex vivo in synaptosomes prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple METH injections, this deficit was reversed completely 24 h after drug treatment. Also in contrast to effects of multiple METH injections, 1) MDMA caused little or no decrease in binding of the DAT ligand WIN35428, and 2) neither prevention of hyperthermia nor prior depletion of DA prevented the MDMA-induced reduction in plasmalemmal DA transport. However, a role for phosphorylation was suggested because pretreatment with protein kinase C inhibitors attenuated the deficit caused by MDMA in an in vitro model system. In addition to affecting DAT function, MDMA rapidly decreased vesicular DA transport as assessed in striatal vesicles prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple METH injections reported previously, this decrease partially recovered by 24 h after drug treatment. Taken together, these results reveal several differences between effects of MDMA and previously reported METH on DAT and VMAT-2; differences that may underlie the dissimilar neurotoxic profile of these agents.

23537582|t|Integrated chemical and biological analysis to explain estrogenic potency in bile extracts of red mullet (Mullus barbatus).
23537582|a|A biological screening was performed to establish the total exposure to estrogenic compounds of red mullet (Mullus barbatus) collected at several sites along the Spanish Mediterranean coast by testing male fish bile extracts using the in vitro ER-LUC reporter gene assay. In addition, major metabolites were identified and measurements of OH-PAHs (1-naphthol, 9-phenantrol, 9-fluorenol, 1-pyrenol, 1OH-BaP and 3OH-BaP) and alkylphenols (4-n-nonylphenol (4-n-NP) and 4-tertoctylphenol (4-tert-OP)) in the same fish bile extracts were taken by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in electron ionization mode (GC-EI-MS). Relative in vitro estrogenic potencies of the chemically quantified compounds were also tested. The highest biliary concentrations of 1-pyrenol, 9-fluorenol and 4-n-NP were found in fish from Barcelona and from the Mar Menor coastal lagoon. However, these concentrations can be considered relatively low compared to values reported in red mullet from other polluted waters in the Mediterranean Sea. The contribution of 1-pyrenol, 4-n-NP and 4-tert-OP to the total estrogenic potency measured in male fish bile was found to be negligible, indicating the presence of other estrogenic compounds in red mullet bile. Estrogenic potency in bile from male fish was markedly elevated in Mar Menor lagoon (234.8+5.7pgE2EQ/ul), and further research will be necessary to explain whether the presence of natural and synthetic-hormones in the lagoon contributed to this finding. Values of approximately 15-16E2EQpg/mg bile can be regarded as preliminary baseline levels of bile estrogenicity in male red mullet from the western Mediterranean Sea.

23608239|t|Protective effect of ethyl acetate fraction of Acacia ferruginea DC. against ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats.
23608239|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In traditional systems of medicine, stem bark of Acacia ferruginea DC. is used for the treatment of itching, leucoderma, ulcers, stomatitis and diseases of the blood. In the present study, we determined antioxidant and anti-ulcerogenic activities of Acacia ferruginea stem bark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acetone extract and its sub-fractions of Acacia ferruginea stem bark were subjected to assess their antioxidant potential using various in vitro systems such as DPPH(.), ABTS(.+) scavenging, FRAP and phosphomolybdenum reduction activities. Based on the antioxidant potential, the ethyl acetate fraction was used to evaluate the protective effect of ethanol-induced gastric damage in rat model. Enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione, catalase and lipid peroxidation were also determined in the stomach tissues. RESULTS: Ethyl acetate fraction (AFE) of Acacia ferruginea stem bark registered higher antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities than the crude acetone extract and other fractions. In addition, AFE exhibited that the IC50 values of DPPH (2.5ug/ml) and ABTS (1.8ug/ml) were lower when compared to the standard quercetin (12.4ug/ml and 4.7ug/ml, respectively). In ethanol induced gastric ulcer, administration of AFE at doses of 10mg/kg, 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg body weight prior to ethanol ingestion significantly protected the stomach ulceration. Consequently significant changes were observed in enzyme activities such as SOD, CAT, GSH and LPO in the stomach tissues when compared with ethanol control group. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the ethyl acetate fraction of Acacia ferruginea stem bark possessed higher antioxidant and anti-ulcerogenic activities. Based on the results we suggest that Acacia ferruginea stem bark has potential to provide a therapeutic approach to ethanol mediated ulcer as an effective anti-ulcer agent.

11972613|t|Cysteinyl leukotriene-dependent interleukin-5 production leading to eosinophilia during late asthmatic response in guinea-pigs.
11972613|a|BACKGROUND: Allergic airway eosinophilia is suppressed by cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptor (CysLT1 receptor) antagonists in several species including humans and guinea-pigs, suggesting that CysLTs are directly or indirectly involved in induction of the response. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of CysLT antagonists (pranlukast and MCI-826) on antigen inhalation-induced eosinophilia in peripheral blood and lung, and on IL-5 activity in serum during late increase of airway resistance (late asthmatic response, LAR) in sensitized guinea-pigs. METHODS: Guinea-pigs inhaled ovalbumin (OVA) + Al(OH)3 and OVA mists alternately for sensitization and challenge, respectively, once every 2 weeks. At the fifth challenge, the effects of CysLT antagonists and an anti-IL-5 antibody (TRFK-5) on the occurrence of LAR, and blood and lung eosinophilia, which appeared at 5 h after challenge, were examined. The time-course of IL-5 activity in the serum after the challenge was evaluated by measuring in vitro 'eosinophil survival prolongation activity'. The influence of CysLT antagonists on IL-5 activity was assessed. RESULTS: CysLT antagonists and TRFK-5 completely abolished blood and lung eosinophilia. LAR was suppressed by both MCI-826 and TRFK-5 by 40-50%. Sera obtained from sensitized, challenged animals 3 h and 4 h after challenge induced an obvious prolongation of eosinophil survival. The activity of the sera was completely neutralized by prior exposure to TRFK-5, suggesting that it reflected IL-5 activity. Increased IL-5 activity in the serum was inhibited by both pranlukast and MCI-826 by over 90%. CONCLUSIONS: CysLTs produced after antigen provocation sequentially induced IL-5 production from some immune component cells via CysLT1 receptor activation. Thus, it is likely that CysLTs indirectly cause antigen-induced eosinophilia through IL-5 production.

16399380|t|Characterization of the omega class of glutathione transferases.
16399380|a|The Omega class of cytosolic glutathione transferases was initially recognized by bioinformatic analysis of human sequence databases, and orthologous sequences were subsequently discovered in mouse, rat, pig, Caenorhabditis elegans, Schistosoma mansoni, and Drosophila melanogaster. In humans and mice, two GSTO genes have been recognized and their genetic structures and expression patterns identified. In both species, GSTO1 mRNA is expressed in liver and heart as well as a range of other tissues. GSTO2 is expressed predominantly in the testis, although moderate levels of expression are seen in other tissues. Extensive immunohistochemistry of rat and human tissue sections has demonstrated cellular and subcellular specificity in the expression of GSTO1-1. The crystal structure of recombinant human GSTO1-1 has been determined, and it adopts the canonical GST fold. A cysteine residue in place of the catalytic tyrosine or serine residues found in other GSTs was shown to form a mixed disulfide with glutathione. Omega class GSTs have dehydroascorbate reductase and thioltransferase activities and also catalyze the reduction of monomethylarsonate, an intermediate in the pathway of arsenic biotransformation. Other diverse actions of human GSTO1-1 include modulation of ryanodine receptors and interaction with cytokine release inhibitory drugs. In addition, GSTO1 has been linked to the age at onset of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Several polymorphisms have been identified in the coding regions of the human GSTO1 and GSTO2 genes. Our laboratory has expressed recombinant human GSTO1-1 and GSTO2-2 proteins, as well as a number of polymorphic variants. The expression and purification of these proteins and determination of their enzymatic activity is described.

23099431|t|Pharmacokinetic study of Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptide 6 (GHRP-6) in nine male healthy volunteers.
23099431|a|GHRP-6 is a growth hormone secretagogue that also enhances tissue viability in different organs. In the present work, we studied the pharmacokinetics of this short therapeutic hexapeptide (His-(D-Trp)-Ala-Trp-(D-Phe)-Lys-NH(2,) MW=872.44 Da) in nine male healthy volunteers after a single intravenous bolus administration of 100, 200 and 400 ug/kg of body weight. GHRP-6 was quantified in human plasma by a specific LC-MS method, previously developed and validated following FDA guidelines, using (13)C(3)Ala-GHRP-6 as internal standard (Gil et al., 2012, J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 60, 19-25). The Lower Limit of Quantification (5 ng/mL) was reached in all subjects at 12h post-administration, which was sufficient for modeling a pharmacokinetic profile including over 85% of the Area under the Curve (AUC). Disposition of GHRP-6 best fitted a bi-exponential function with R(2) higher than 0.99, according to a mathematic modeling and confirmed by an Akaike index (AIC) lower than that of the corresponding one-compartment model for all subjects. Averaging all three dose levels, the distribution and elimination half-life of GHRP-6 were 7.6 + 1.9 min and 2.5 + 1.1h, respectively. These values are coherent with existing data for other drugs whose disposition also fits this model. Dose dependence analysis revealed a noticeable trend for AUC to increase proportionally with administered dose. Atypical GHRP-6 concentration spikes were observed during the elimination phase in four out of the nine subjects studied.

23423972|t|Absorption, distribution, and biotransformation of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine in B6C3F1 mice (Mus musculus).
23423972|a|Absorption, distribution, and biotransformation are 3 critical aspects affecting toxicant action in animals. In the present study, B6C3F1 mice (Mus musculus) were exposed for 28 d to contaminated feed that contained 1 of 5 different hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) concentrations: 0 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg. The authors quantified RDX and its reductive transformation products hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine (MNX), hexahydro-1,3-dinitroso-5-nitro-1,3,5-triazine (DNX), and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazine (TNX) in the stomach, intestine, plasma, liver, and brain of these mice. Average RDX concentrations followed a dose-dependent pattern for all matrices tested. No controls had concentrations above limits of detection. Average RDX concentrations in tissues of exposed mice ranged from 11.1 ng/mL to 182 ng/mL, 25.6 ng/g to 3319 ng/g, 123 ng/g to 233 ng/g, 144 ng/g to 35 900 ng/g, and 51.1 ng/g to 2697 ng/g in the plasma, brain, liver, stomach, and intestine, respectively. A considerable amount of RDX was present in the brain, especially in the highest-exposure group. This is consistent with the widely observed central nervous system effects caused by g-aminobutyric acid inhibition associated with RDX exposure. N-nitroso metabolites of RDX were also present in tested tissues in a dose-dependent pattern. Average MNX concentrations in the stomachs of mice exposed to RDX ranged from nondetectable in control exposures to 490 ng/g in the highest-exposure groups. In the brain, MNX accumulated at a maximum average concentration of 165.1 ng/g, suggesting the potential formation of MNX from RDX within the brain. At higher exposures, DNX and TNX were present in the stomach, plasma, and brain of mice. The presence of RDX metabolites at notable amounts in different tissues suggests that RDX can transform into its N-nitroso metabolites in vivo by an undefined mechanism.

17334708|t|Xanthurenic aciduria due to a mutation in KYNU encoding kynureninase.
17334708|a|Massive urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine and kynurenine, known as xanthurenic aciduria or hydroxykynureninuria, in a young Somali boy suggested kynureninase deficiency. Mutation analysis of KYNU encoding kynureninase of the index case revealed homozygosity for a c.593 A > G substitution leading to a threonine-to-alanine (T198A) shift. A younger brother was found to have a similar excretion pattern and the same genotype. At present, neither of the two boys has symptoms of niacin deficiency. This is the first report linking xanthurenic aciduria to a mutation in the gene encoding kynureninase.

23146664|t|Mesalamine modulates intercellular adhesion through inhibition of p-21 activated kinase-1.
23146664|a|Mesalamine (5-ASA) is widely used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, a remitting condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the colon. Knowledge about the molecular and cellular targets of 5-ASA is limited and a clear understanding of its activity in intestinal homeostasis and interference with neoplastic progression is lacking. We sought to identify molecular pathways interfered by 5-ASA, using CRC cell lines with different genetic background. Microarray was performed for gene expression profile of 5-ASA-treated and untreated cells (HCT116 and HT29). Filtering and analysis of data identified three oncogenic pathways interfered by 5-ASA: MAPK/ERK pathway, cell adhesion and b-catenin/Wnt signaling. PAK1 emerged as a consensus target of 5-ASA, orchestrating these pathways. We further investigated the effect of 5-ASA on cell adhesion. 5-ASA increased cell adhesion which was measured by cell adhesion assay and transcellular-resistance measurement. Moreover, 5-ASA treatment restored membranous expression of adhesion molecules E-cadherin and b-catenin. Role of PAK1 as a mediator of mesalamine activity was validated in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of PAK1 by RNA interference also increased cell adhesion. PAK1 expression was elevated in APC(min) polyps and 5-ASA treatment reduced its expression. Our data demonstrates novel pharmacological mechanism of mesalamine in modulation of cell adhesion and role of PAK1 in APC(min) polyposis. We propose that inhibition of PAK1 expression by 5-ASA can impede with neoplastic progression in colorectal carcinogenesis. The mechanism of PAK1 inhibition and induction of membranous translocation of adhesion proteins by 5-ASA might be independent of its known anti-inflammatory action.

19372559|t|Chromatin-associated proteins HMGB1/2 and PDIA3 trigger cellular response to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage.
19372559|a|The identification of new molecular components of the DNA damage signaling cascade opens novel avenues to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. High-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1) is a DNA damage sensor responsive to the incorporation of nonnatural nucleosides into DNA; several nuclear and cytosolic proteins are functionally integrated with HMGB1 in the context of DNA damage response. The functional role of HMGB1 and HMGB1-associated proteins (high-mobility group protein B2, HMGB2; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH; protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3, PDIA3; and heat shock 70 kDa protein 8, HSPA8) in DNA damage response was assessed in human carcinoma cells A549 and UO31 by transient knockdown with short interfering RNAs. Using the cell proliferation assay, we found that knockdown of HMGB1-associated proteins resulted in 8-fold to 50-fold decreased chemosensitivity of A549 cells to cytarabine. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent microscopy were used to evaluate genotoxic stress markers in knocked-down cancer cells after 24 to 72 hours of incubation with 1 micromol/L of cytarabine. Our results dissect the roles of HMGB1-associated proteins in DNA damage response: HMGB1 and HMGB2 facilitate p53 phosphorylation after exposure to genotoxic stress, and PDIA3 has been found essential for H2AX phosphorylation (no gamma-H2AX accumulated after 24-72 hours of incubation with 1 micromol/L of cytarabine in PDIA3 knockdown cells). We conclude that phosphorylation of p53 and phosphorylation of H2AX occur in two distinct branches of the DNA damage response. These findings identify new molecular components of the DNA damage signaling cascade and provide novel promising targets for chemotherapeutic intervention.

23625804|t|Mechanistic Aspects of hSOD1 Maturation from the Solution Structure of Cu(I) -Loaded hCCS Domain 1 and Analysis of Disulfide-Free hSOD1 Mutants.
23625804|a|Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) maturation within the cell is mainly accomplished with the SOD1-specific chaperone, CCS, a dimeric protein with three distinct domains in each monomer. We recently showed that the first domain of human CCS (hCCSD1) is responsible for copper transfer to its protein partner, human SOD1 (hSOD1). The NMR solution structure of the copper(I)-loaded form of hCCSD1 reported here contributes further to characterization of the copper-transfer mechanism to hSOD1. NMR spectroscopy was also used to examine the hSOD1 mutants C57A, C146A, and C57A/C146A, which are unable to form the structurally conserved disulfide bond in SOD1, in order to investigate the role of these cysteines during hSOD1 copper acquisition. Together, the information on both hCCS and hSOD1, along with a sequence analysis of eukaryotic CCSD1, allows us to propose important mechanistic aspects regarding the copper-transfer process from hCCS to hSOD1.

14692707|t|Serum carvedilol concentration and its relation to change in plasma brain natriuretic peptide level in the treatment of heart failure: a preliminary study.
14692707|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of carvedilol dose and concentration in serum on plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a measure of heart failure progression. METHODS: 12 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III chronic heart failure were enrolled in the study. They received carvedilol at daily doses of 1-20 mg with a 1-2 weekly adjustment. Serum carvedilol trough concentrations were measured in steady-state using a specific fluorescence HPLC method. The degree of improvement in heart failure was assessed from the ratio of change in the plasma BNP concentration, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after the commencement of carvedilol administration. RESULTS: From the pharmacokinetic aspect, there was no valid correlation between the trough serum carvedilol concentration (Cmin) and daily dose per body weight (Dd/BW), indicating that there was a wide difference in the carvedilol elimination capacity among individuals. A significant decrease in the BNP was observed at the 3rd month in patients treated with the high dose (> 750 mg/3 months). On the other hand, in patients with a mean serum carvedilol level (Cmin) of less than 2.5 nmol/l up to 2 weeks after the start ofcarvedilol therapy, the degree of reduction in the BNP value after the 3rd month was significantly larger, relative to the patient group with Cmin over 2.5 nmol/l. CONCLUSIONS: The total carvedilol dose was confirmed to be one of the determinants for improvement in heart failure, and it was suggested that the initial serum level also plays an important role in therapeutic outcome. Therefore, it may be important to monitor the serum carvedilol level at the introductory period to determine the daily dose requirements because of the wide inter-individual variability in its metabolic clearance.

23275442|t|The COP9 signalosome interacts with and regulates interferon regulatory factor 5 protein stability.
23275442|a|The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) exerts crucial functions in the regulation of host immunity against extracellular pathogens, DNA damage-induced apoptosis, death receptor signaling, and macrophage polarization. Tight regulation of IRF5 is thus warranted for an efficient response toward extracellular stressors and for limiting autoimmune and inflammatory responses. Here we report that the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a general modulator of diverse cellular and developmental processes, associates constitutively with IRF5 and promotes its protein stability. The constitutive CSN/IRF5 interaction was identified using proteomics and confirmed by endogenous immunoprecipitations. The CSN/IRF5 interaction occurred on the carboxyl and amino termini of IRF5; a single internal deletion from amino acids 455 to 466 (D455-466) was found to significantly reduce IRF5 protein stability. CSN subunit 3 (CSN3) was identified as a direct interacting partner of IRF5, and knockdown of this subunit with small interfering RNAs resulted in enhanced degradation. Degradation was further augmented by knockdown of CSN1 and CSN3 together. The ubiquitin E1 inhibitor UBEI-41 or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented IRF5 degradation, supporting the idea that its stability is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Importantly, activation of IRF5 by the death receptor ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resulted in enhanced degradation via loss of the CSN/IRF5 interaction. This study defines CSN to be a new interacting partner of IRF5 that controls its stability.

12636181|t|Butyrylcholinesterase: an important new target in Alzheimer's disease therapy.
12636181|a|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) predominates in the healthy brain, with butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) considered to play a minor role in regulating brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels. However, BuChE activity progressively increases in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), while AChE activity remains unchanged or declines. Both enzymes therefore represent legitimate therapeutic targets for ameliorating the cholinergic deficit considered to be responsible for the declines in cognitive, behavioral and global functioning characteristic of AD. The two enzymes differ in substrate specificity, kinetics and activity in different brain regions. Experimental evidence from the use of agents with enhanced selectivity for BuChE (cymserine analogues, MF-8622) and the dual inhibitor of both AChE and BuChE, rivastigmine, indicates potential therapeutic benefits of inhibiting both AChE and BuChE in AD and related dementias. Recent evidence suggests that both AChE and BuChE may have roles in the aetiology and progression of AD beyond regulation of synaptic ACh levels. The development of specific BuChE inhibitors and further experience with the dual enzyme inhibitor rivastigmine will improve understanding of the aetiology of AD and should lead to a wider variety of potent treatment options.

23250811|t|Curcumin improves TNBS-induced colitis in rats by inhibiting IL-27 expression via the TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway.
23250811|a|Curcumin is a widely used spice with anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. It has been reported to have beneficial effects in experimental colitis. This study explored whether curcumin improves colonic inflammation in a rat colitis model through inhibition of the TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway and IL-27 expression. After induction of colitis with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, rats were intragastrically administered with curcumin or sulfasalazine daily for one week. Rat intestinal mucosa was collected for evaluation of the disease activity index, colonic mucosa damage index, and histological score. Myeloperoxidase activity was detected by immunohistochemistry, and mRNA and protein expression levels of TLR4, NF-kB, and IL-27 in colonic mucosa were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Compared with the untreated colitis group, the curcumin-treated group showed significant decreases in the disease activity index, colonic mucosa damage index, histological score, myeloperoxidase activity, and expressions of NF-kB mRNA, IL-27 mRNA, TLR4 protein, NF-kB p65 protein, and IL-27 p28 protein (p < 0.05). TLR4 mRNA expression did not differ between groups. Disease activity index decreased more rapidly in the curcumin-treated group than in the sulfasalazine-treated group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in TLR4, NF-kB, and IL-27 mRNA and proteins between curcumin-treated and sulfasalazine-treated groups. Curcumin shows significant therapeutic effects on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis that are comparable to sulfasalazine. The anti-inflammatory actions of curcumin on colitis may involve inhibition of the TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway and of IL-27 expression.

7560228|t|The effect of triclosan on mediators of gingival inflammation.
7560228|a|Triclosan (2,4,4',-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenylether) is a well-known and widely used nonionic antibacterial agent which has recently been introduced in toothpastes and mouthrinses. The efficacy of triclosan-containing toothpaste and mouthrinse to reduce both plaque and gingivitis in long-term clinical trials has been well documented. Until recently, it was generally assumed that triclosan's effect on gingival inflammation was due to its antimicrobial and anti-plaque effect. It has now become apparent that triclosan may have a direct anti-inflammatory effect on the gingival tissues. Several in vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of triclosan on 4 primary enzymes of the pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism, cyclo-oxygenase 1, cyclo-oxygenase 2, 5-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase. These pathways lead to the production of known mediators of inflammation such as the prostaglandins, leukotrienes and lipoxins. Triclosan inhibited both cyclooxygenase 1 and cyclo-oxygenase 2 with IC-50 values of 43 microM and 227 microM, respectively. Triclosan also inhibited 5-lipoxygenase with an IC-50 of 43 microM. The 15-lipoxygenase was similarly inhibited by triclosan with an IC-50 of 61 microM. Hence, triclosan has the ability to inhibit both the cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism with similar efficacy. In cell culture experiments, it was found that triclosan inhibited IL-1 beta induced prostaglandin E2 production by human gingival fibroblasts in a concentration dependent manner, and at relatively low concentrations. These data, taken together, indicate that triclosan can inhibit formation of several important mediators of gingival inflammation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

23059655|t|Nano-graphene in biomedicine: theranostic applications.
23059655|a|Owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, graphene and its derivatives such as graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and GO-nanocomposites have attracted tremendous interest in many different fields including biomedicine in recent years. With every atom exposed on its surface, single-layered graphene shows ultra-high surface area available for efficient molecular loading and bioconjugation, and has been widely explored as novel nano-carriers for drug and gene delivery. Utilizing the intrinsic near-infrared (NIR) optical absorbance, in vivo graphene-based photothermal therapy has been realized, achieving excellent anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy in animal experiments. A variety of inorganic nanoparticles can be grown on the surface of nano-graphene, obtaining functional graphene-based nanocomposites with interesting optical and magnetic properties useful for multi-modal imaging and imaging-guided cancer therapy. Moreover, significant efforts have also been devoted to study the behaviors and toxicology of functionalized nano-graphene in animals. It has been uncovered that both surface chemistry and sizes play key roles in controlling the biodistribution, excretion, and toxicity of nano-graphene. Biocompatibly coated nano-graphene with ultra-small sizes can be cleared out from body after systemic administration, without rendering noticeable toxicity to the treated mice. In this review article, we will summarize the latest progress in this rapidly growing field, and discuss future prospects and challenges of using graphene-based materials for theranostic applications.

20531964|t|Everolimus: the first approved product for patients with advanced renal cell cancer after sunitinib and/or sorafenib.
20531964|a|Everolimus (RAD001, Afinitor((R)) Novartis) is the first oral inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) to reach the oncology clinic. Everolimus 10 mg daily achieves complete inhibition of its target at below the maximum tolerable dose for most patients. A phase III randomized placebo-controlled trial has examined the impact of everolimus in patients with clear cell renal cancers and progressive disease on or within 6 months of the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The primary endpoint of progression-free survival was increased from median 1.9 to 4.9 months (hazard ratio 0.33, P < 0.001) and 25% were still progression-free after 10 months of everolimus therapy. There was a delay in time to decline of performance status and trends to improvement in quality of life, disease-related symptoms, and overall survival despite crossover of the majority of patients assigned to placebo. In 2009, everolimus was approved in the US and Europe as the only validated option for this indication. Toxicities are usually mild to moderate and can be managed with dose reduction or interruption if necessary. Opportunistic infections and non-infectious pneumonitis are seen as a class effect. Management of common practical management issues are discussed. Clinical trials are in progress to examine additional roles for everolimus in renal cancer, alone and in combination with other agents.

17000933|t|Medroxyprogesterone acetate but not drospirenone ablates the protective function of 17 beta-estradiol in aldosterone salt-treated rats.
17000933|a|Controversial results obtained from human and animal studies on the prevention of heart disease by estrogens and progestins warrant a better understanding of nuclear hormone receptor function and interaction. To address this issue and taking into account that effects of synthetic progestins are not only referable to action through the progesterone receptor but may also be mediated by other steroid receptors, we characterized cardiovascular function and inflammatory gene expression in aldosterone salt-treated rats on long-term administration of 17beta-estradiol, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and drospirenone, a new progestogen exhibiting antimineralocorticoid activity. The complex pattern of cardiovascular injury in ovariectomized Wistar rats induced by chronic aldosterone infusion plus a high-salt diet was significantly attenuated in sham-ovariectomized rats and by coadministration of 17beta-estradiol in ovariectomized animals after 8 weeks of continuous treatment. The beneficial role of 17beta-estradiol on blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, vascular osteopontin expression, perivascular fibrosis, and impaired NO-dependent relaxation of isolated aortic rings was completely abrogated by coadministration of medroxyprogesterone acetate. In contrast, drospirenone was either neutral or additive to 17beta-estradiol in protecting against aldosterone salt-induced cardiovascular injury and inflammation. The current results support the hypothesis of complex interactions among estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, androgen, and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling in cardiovascular injury and inflammation. Novel progestins, such as drospirenone, confer superior effects compared with medroxyprogesterone acetate in a model of aldosterone-induced heart disease because of its antimineralocorticoid properties.

14501155|t|The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine increases plasma glucose levels of mice.
14501155|a|Effects of the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine on plasma glucose levels in mice were studied. Clomipramine at doses ranging 5 - 20 mg/kg elicited significant hyperglycemia in mice. Hyperglycemia elicited by clomipramine was not reduced by pretreatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) depleter p-chlorophenylalanine. The 5-HT(1/2/5/7)-receptor antagonist methysergide and the 5-HT(2A/2B/2C)-receptor antagonist LY 53857 enhanced clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia, while the 5-HT(1A/1B)-receptor antagonist (-)-propranolol and the 5-HT(3/4)-receptor antagonist tropisetron did not affect it. The 5-HT(2B/2C)-receptor antagonist SB 206553 facilitated hyperglycemia induced by clomipramine, although the 5-HT(2A)-receptor antagonist ketanserin was without effect. Clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia was reduced by prior adrenalectomy. These results suggest that clomipramine induces hyperglycemia in mice by blocking the 5-HT(2B )and/or 5-HT(2C) receptors, which results in facilitation of adrenaline release.

22981796|t|Validation of an in vitro exposure system for toxicity assessment of air-delivered nanomaterials.
22981796|a|To overcome the limitations of in vitro exposure of submerged lung cells to nanoparticles (NPs), we validated an integrated low flow system capable of generating and depositing airborne NPs directly onto cells at an air-liquid interface (ALI). The in vitro exposure system was shown to provide uniform and controlled dosing of particles with 70.3% efficiency to epithelial cells grown on transwells. This system delivered a continuous airborne exposure of NPs to lung cells without loss of cell viability in repeated 4h exposure periods. We sequentially exposed cells to air-delivered copper (Cu) NPs in vitro to compare toxicity results to our prior in vivo inhalation studies. The evaluation of cellular dosimetry indicated that a large amount of Cu was taken up, dissolved and released into the basolateral medium (62% of total mass). Exposure to Cu NPs decreased cell viability to 73% (p<0.01) and significantly (p<0.05) elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, intracellular reactive oxygen species and interleukin-8 that mirrored our findings from subacute in vivo inhalation studies in mice. Our results show that this exposure system is useful for screening of NP toxicity in a manner that represents cellular responses of the pulmonary epithelium in vivo.

22445601|t|Differentiating the roles of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors using LY541850, an mGlu2 agonist/mGlu3 antagonist.
22445601|a|Despite the potential therapeutic relevance of group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, there has been a lack of pharmacological tools for separating the roles of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptor subtypes. LY541850 was claimed from human mGlu receptors expressed in non-neuronal cells to be a selective orthosteric mGlu2 agonist and mGlu3 antagonist. We have verified this pharmacological profile of LY541850 in hippocampal slices. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the temporo-ammonic path (TAP) input to CA1 stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) were inhibited by LY541850 in mGlu3-/- mice (EC(50) 38 nM) and wild-type littermates (EC(50) 42 nM) to a similar extent but were not significantly affected in mGlu2-/- mice. The group II agonist, DCG-IV, inhibited the fEPSP in all three genotypes. Co-application of DCG-IV and LY541850 in mGlu3-/- and wild-type littermates resulted in an additive effect, whereas in mGlu2-/- mice, LY541850 reversed the inhibitory action of DCG-IV. These results confirm the selective mGlu2 agonist and mGlu3 antagonist actions of LY541850. A similar profile of activity was seen in medial perforant path synapse to the dentate gyrus. Systemic administration of LY541850 to wild-type mice, reduced the increase in locomotor activity following both phencyclidine and amphetamine administration. These data support the hypothesis that mGlu2 receptors mediate the antipsychotic effects of mixed group II agonists. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors'.

11166732|t|Glioma cell sensitivity to topotecan: the role of p53 and topotecan-induced DNA damage.
11166732|a|Topotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor which is currently evaluated as an adjuvant agent for malignant glioma. Here, we analysed the effects of topotecan on 12 human malignant glioma cell lines in vitro. All cell lines expressed topoisomerase I mRNA. High p53 protein levels, but not genetic or functional p53 status, were associated with increased topotecan-induced DNA/topoisomerase I complex formation. Neither functional p53 status, nor p53 protein levels, nor complex formation predicted topotecan-induced growth inhibition. We thus confirm a possible role for p53 protein in modulating topoisomerase I activity but conclude that the major molecular determinants of topotecan sensitivity in glioma cells await identification.

15898717|t|Structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic analysis of the binding of the 40 kDa PEG-interferon-alpha2a and its individual positional isomers to the extracellular domain of the receptor IFNAR2.
15898717|a|Type-I Interferons exert antiviral and antiproliferative activities through the binding to a common cell surface receptor comprising two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Human recombinant Interferon-alpha(2a) (IFNalpha(2a)) is a potent drug (Roferon-A) used to treat various cancers and viral diseases including Hepatitis B/C infections. To significantly improve the pharmacological properties of the drug, a pegylated form of IFNalpha(2a) was developed (PEGASYS). This 40 kDa PEG-conjugated IFNalpha(2a) ((40)PEG-IFNalpha(2a)) is obtained by the covalent binding of one 40 kDa branched PEG-polymer to a lysine side-chain of IFNalpha(2a). Here, we report the detailed structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic analysis of the binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor IFNAR2 of (40)PEG-IFNalpha(2a) and its isolated positional isomers modified at K31, K134, K131, K121, K164, and K70, respectively, in comparison with unmodified IFNalpha(2a). Our binding studies, using the surface plasmon resonance technique, show that the pegylation does not abolish the binding to the receptor, but significantly reduces the affinity mainly due to a change of the association rate. The results are supported by modeling and simulation of the binding, using Self-Avoiding-Walk calculations for the polymer conformations. A correlation between the structural parameters and the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the binding of the positional isomers could be established. For the Isomer-K31 and -K164, the PEG-polymer attachment point is located in proximity to the binding interface, and the isomers display affinity in the range 150-520 nM in an enthalpy-driven binding process. In contrast for the Isomer-K134, -K131, -K121, and -K70, the PEG-polymer is attached remotely from the binding interface, and the isomers exhibit a higher affinity (32-76 nM) in an entropy-driven binding process. This study constitutes an essential collection of knowledge on which the interaction of (40)PEG-IFNalpha(2a) and its positional isomers with its cellular receptors can be better understood.

3588607|t|Adenosine receptors: development of selective agonists and antagonists.
3588607|a|Adenosine modulates a variety of physiological functions through interaction with A1 and A2 adenosine receptors, where agonists mediate inhibition and stimulation, respectively, of adenylate cyclase. In the cardiovascular system, A2 receptors mediate vasodilation and reduction in blood pressure, while A1 receptors mediate cardiac depression. The involvement of adenylate cyclase in these responses remains unresolved. Adenosine analogs in particular the N6-substituted compounds are more potent at A1 receptors than at A2 receptors. The subregion of the adenosine receptor that interacts with the N6-substituent is different for A1 and A2 receptors, particularly with respect to phenyl interactions, bulk tolerance and stereoselectivity. A series of para-substituted N6-phenyladenosines have been synthesized based on a "functionalized congener" approach in which a chemically reactive group, such as an amine or carboxylic acid, is introduced at the terminus of a chain. From the "functionalized congener" are synthesized a variety of conjugates each containing a common pharmacophore. Certain of the adenosine conjugates are highly selective for A1 receptors. Xanthines are classical antagonists for adenosine receptors for many of their pharmacological actions may be due to blockade of adenosine receptors. Caffeine and theophylline are virtually non-selective for A2 and A2 receptors. Replacement of the methyl groups of theophylline with n-propyl or larger alkyl groups yields xanthines with selectivity for A1 receptors, particularly when combined with an 8-phenyl moiety. Most 1,3-dialkyl-8-phenyl xanthines are very insoluble, but incorporation of polar aryl substituents, such as sulfo or carboxy to increase solubility, results in marked reduction in potency and selectivity. A new series of more hydrophilic 1,3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthines has been synthesized using the "functionalized congener" approach. Certain conjugates of 8-[4-(carboxymethyloxy)phenyl 1]1,3-dipropylxanthine display A1 selectivity in biochemical and cardiovascular models. Certain analogs of caffeine in which the methyl group at the 1- or 7-position is replaced with a propargyl or propyl group display selectivity for A2 receptors. The profile of a series of adenosine analogs or of xanthine antagonists can be used to define the nature of adenosine receptors.

23479738|t|Multilevel regulation of 2-cys peroxiredoxin reaction cycle by s-nitrosylation.
23479738|a|S-Nitrosothiols (SNOs), formed by nitric oxide (NO)-mediated S-nitrosylation, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a prominent reactive oxygen species, are implicated in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Recent research has shown that the cellular action and metabolism of SNOs and H2O2 involve overlapping, thiol-based mechanisms, but how these reactive species may affect each other's fate and function is not well understood. In this study we investigated how NO/SNO may affect the redox cycle of mammalian peroxiredoxin-1 (Prx1), a representative of the 2-Cys Prxs, a group of thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent peroxidases. We found that, both in a cell-free system and in cells, NO/SNO donors such as S-nitrosocysteine and S-nitrosoglutathione readily induced the S-nitrosylation of Prx1, causing structural and functional alterations. In particular, nitrosylation promoted disulfide formation involving the pair of catalytic cysteines (Cys-52 and Cys-173) and disrupted the oligomeric structure of Prx1, leading to loss of peroxidase activity. A highly potent inhibition of the peroxidase catalytic reaction by NO/SNO was seen in assays employing the coupled Prx-Trx system. In this setting, S-nitrosocysteine (10 um) effectively blocked the Trx-mediated regeneration of oxidized Prx1. This effect appeared to be due to both competition between S-nitrosocysteine and Prx1 for the Trx system and direct modulation by S-nitrosocysteine of Trx reductase activity. Our findings that NO/SNO target both Prx and Trx reductase may have implications for understanding the impact of nitrosylation on cellular redox homeostasis.

23266505|t|Activation of an apoptotic signal transduction pathway involved in the upregulation of calpain and apoptosis-inducing factor in aldosterone-induced primary cultured cardiomyocytes.
23266505|a|In this study, aldosterone (ALD)-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocyte was evaluated based on the previous studies, and the roles of calpain signaling were clarified. Primary cultured rat cardiomyocytes were injured by ALD (0.01-10 uM) for varying time periods. Then, the effects of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (0.5 mM), calpeptin (2.5 uM), and spironoclactone (10 uM) were evaluated on cardiomyocytes activated by ALD. Cardiomyocytes that were injured by ALD were assayed by the MTT and LDH leakage ratio. Apoptosis was evaluated by a TUNEL assay, annexin V/PI staining, and caspase-3 activity. The expression of cleavage of Bid (tBid), calpain and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was evaluated by western blot analysis. ALD increased calpain expression and caspase-3 activity and promoted Bid cleavage. It also induced the release of AIF from mitochondria into the cytosol. The upregulation of calpain, tBid and caspase-3 activity were further inhibited by treatment with EGTA in the presence of ALD. Additionally, AIF levels in the cytosol decreased due to EGTA but not due to calpeptin. This was also accompanied by a significant decrease in apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment with spironoclactone not only attenuated the pro-apoptotic effect of ALD but reversed the ALD-induced increase of calpain and AIF levels.

In rats treated with GCs for 4 days, altered serum and bile BA levels, changed conjugation pattern, and delayed and decreased ability to conjugate/secrete exogenously administered deoxycholate, were found using HPLC-MS/MS. RT-QPCR analyses revealed that GC treatment also induced a down-regulation of liver nuclear receptors (Fxr, Gr and Shp), transporters (Ntcp, Mrp4 and Bcrp) and enzymes (Cyp7a1 and Baat), whereas Bsep, Mrp2 and Cyp27a1 were up-regulated. Human HepG2 and Alexander cell lines were used as in vitro models of liver cells with and without constitutive FXR expression, respectively. In HepG2 cells, GCs induced a decreased expression of FXR and SHP, and inhibited the regulatory effect of GW4064 on FXR-target genes. In Alexander cells, only when they were transfected with FXR+RXR, GW4064 caused up-regulation of SHP and OSTb, and a down-regulation of CYP27A1. GCs had the opposite effect on these genes, both in the absence and in the presence of FXR expression. Co-transfection of Alexander cells with IR-1-Luc and FXR+RXR revealed that GCs did not inhibit but moderately enhanced FXR activity. Moreover, GCs have a synergistic effect on GW4064-induced FXR activation, whereas chenodeoxycholate and GW4064 have an additive effect. In conclusion, GCs are able to directly or indirectly activate FXR but they also antagonize, through FXR-independent mechanisms, the expression of FXR and FXR target genes involved in the hepatic handling of BAs.

12724156|t|GluR5 kainate receptors, seizures, and the amygdala.
12724156|a|The amygdala is a critical brain region for limbic seizure activity, but the mechanisms underlying its epileptic susceptibility are obscure. Several lines of evidence implicate GluR5 (GLU(K5)) kainate receptors, a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor, in the amygdala's vulnerability to seizures and epileptogenesis. GluR5 mRNA is abundant in temporal lobe structures including the amygdala. Brain slice recordings indicate that GluR5 kainate receptors mediate a portion of the synaptic excitation of neurons in the rat basolateral amygdala. Whole-cell voltage-clamp studies demonstrate that GluR5 kainate receptor-mediated synaptic currents are inwardly rectifying and are likely to be calcium permeable. Prolonged activation of basolateral amygdala GluR5 kainate receptors results in enduring synaptic facilitation through a calcium-dependent process. The selective GluR5 kainate receptor agonist ATPA induces spontaneous epileptiform bursting that is sensitive to the GluR5 kainate receptor antagonist LY293558. Intra-amygdala infusion of ATPA in the rat induces limbic status epilepticus; in some animals, recurrent spontaneous seizures occur for months after the ATPA treatment. Together, these observations indicate that GluR5 kainate receptors have a unique role in triggering epileptiform activity in the amygdala and could participate in long-term plasticity mechanisms that underlie some forms of epileptogenesis. Accordingly, GluR5 kainate receptors represent a potential target for antiepileptic and antiepileptogenic drug treatments. Most antiepileptic drugs do not act through effects on glutamate receptors. However, topiramate at low concentrations causes slow inhibition of GluR5 kainate receptor-mediated synaptic currents in the basolateral amygdala, indicating that it may protect against seizures, at least in part, through suppression of GluR5 kainate receptor responses.

2888789|t|Bevantolol: a beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist with unique additional actions.
2888789|a|UNLABELLED: Bevantolol is a beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist that has been shown to be as effective as other beta blockers for the treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension. Some interesting additional properties, such as the absence of the side effect of cold extremities, required investigation, and a great deal of new evidence has been accumulated during the last three years. This new data is consistent with the proposal put forward a couple of years ago that bevantolol interacts with alpha-adrenoceptors. All the available evidence, published and unpublished, has been reviewed and fits into a coherent pattern, here arranged into five sections. Chemistry: affinity for alpha-adrenoceptors. Animal experiments confirm both agonist and antagonist effects on alpha-receptors, in addition to antagonist activity at beta-1 receptors. In addition, bevantolol has electrophysiologic effects, including bradycardia by a direct action on the sinus node and a class 1 antiarrhythmic action. Investigations in humans have shown that although bevantolol has a short half-life, good control of hypertension can be achieved on once-a-day dosing. SAFETY: bevantolol has remarkably few side effects, does not cause cold extremities, and does not significantly affect glomerular filtration rate in patients with renal impairment. Evidence has been obtained in man for interaction with alpha-adrenoceptors in the brain; and in the peripheral circulation bevantolol does not, as do other beta blockers, increase peripheral vascular resistance, but reduces it. It is suggested that all the additional actions of bevantolol can be attributed to a partial agonist action on alpha-adrenoceptors.

15805193|t|Genetic predictors of the maximum doses patients receive during clinical use of the anti-epileptic drugs carbamazepine and phenytoin.
15805193|a|Phenytoin and carbamazepine are effective and inexpensive anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). As with many AEDs, a broad range of doses is used, with the final "maintenance" dose normally determined by trial and error. Although many genes could influence response to these medicines, there are obvious candidates. Both drugs target the alpha-subunit of the sodium channel, encoded by the SCN family of genes. Phenytoin is principally metabolized by CYP2C9, and both are probable substrates of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein. We therefore assessed whether variation in these genes associates with the clinical use of carbamazepine and phenytoin in cohorts of 425 and 281 patients, respectively. We report that a known functional polymorphism in CYP2C9 is highly associated with the maximum dose of phenytoin (P = 0.0066). We also show that an intronic polymorphism in the SCN1A gene shows significant association with maximum doses in regular usage of both carbamazepine and phenytoin (P = 0.0051 and P = 0.014, respectively). This polymorphism disrupts the consensus sequence of the 5' splice donor site of a highly conserved alternative exon (5N), and it significantly affects the proportions of the alternative transcripts in individuals with a history of epilepsy. These results provide evidence of a drug target polymorphism associated with the clinical use of AEDs and set the stage for a prospective evaluation of how pharmacogenetic diagnostics can be used to improve dosing decisions in the use of phenytoin and carbamazepine. Although the case made here is compelling, our results cannot be considered definitive or ready for clinical application until they are confirmed by independent replication.

17352685|t|Highly selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors for the treatment of allergic skin diseases and psoriasis.
17352685|a|The phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 is the predominant cyclic AMP degrading enzyme in a variety of inflammatory cells including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, T cells and monocytes. In addition, this enzyme is expressed in non-immune cells such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Highly selective PDE4 inhibitors are currently under evaluation for the treatment of asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Due to the broad anti-inflammatory/immuno-modulatory action of PDE4 inhibitors, it has been proposed that PDE4 inhibitors might also be efficacious for skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis. Consequently, PDE4 inhibitors including cilomilast and AWD 12-281 have been tested in several models of allergic and irritant skin inflammation. These PDE4 inhibitors displayed strong anti-inflammatory action in models of allergic contact dermatitis in mice, in the arachidonic acid induced skin inflammation in mice and in ovalbumin sensitised guinea pigs. The determination of cytokines in skin homogenates revealed that both Th1 as well as Th2 cytokines are suppressed by PDE4 inhibitors, indicating an anti-inflammatory activity in both the Th2 dominated acute phase as well as the Th1 dominated chronic phase of atopic dermatitis. Due to the suppression of Th1 cytokines, activity can also be expected in psoriasis. Results of early clinical trials with both topically (cipamfylline, CP80,633) and systemically (CC-10004) active PDE4 inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in atopic dermatitis and in the case of CC-10004, also in psoriasis. AWD 12-281 (GW 842470) is currently under clinical evaluation for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis. Results concerning clinical efficacy of this potent and selective PDE4 inhibitor are anxiously awaited.

17494858|t|Distinct patterns of mutations occurring in de novo AML versus AML arising in the setting of severe congenital neutropenia.
17494858|a|Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is an inborn disorder of granulopoiesis. Like most other bone marrow failure syndromes, it is associated with a marked propensity to transform into a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia, with a cumulative rate of transformation to MDS/leukemia that exceeds 20%. The genetic (and/or epigenetic) changes that contribute to malignant transformation in SCN are largely unknown. In this study, we performed mutational profiling of 14 genes previously implicated in leukemogenesis using 14 MDS/leukemia samples from patients with SCN. We used high-throughput exon-based resequencing of whole-genome-amplified genomic DNA with a semiautomated method to detect mutations. The sensitivity and specificity of the sequencing pipeline was validated by determining the frequency of mutations in these 14 genes using 188 de novo AML samples. As expected, mutations of tyrosine kinase genes (FLT3, KIT, and JAK2) were common in de novo AML, with a cumulative frequency of 30%. In contrast, no mutations in these genes were detected in the SCN samples; instead, mutations of CSF3R, encoding the G-CSF receptor, were common. These data support the hypothesis that mutations of CSF3R may provide the "activated tyrosine kinase signal" that is thought to be important for leukemogenesis.

23418674|t|Development of a cell-based high-throughput peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) screening model and its application for evaluation of the extracts from Rhizoma Coptis.
23418674|a|To date, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are becoming the new therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. In this study, a cell-based high-throughput PPARs (PPARa/b/g) model was developed for the screening of PPARs agonists. The screening conditions were evaluated through analyzing the expression value of luciferase. Finally, 24 h of drug acting time, 5 times of the dilution factor of luciferase zymolyte, and about 2 x 10(4) cells/ well on HeLa cells in 96-well plates were used, respectively. Furthermore, the quality of high-throughput screening (HTS) in stability and reliability was evaluated by the Z'-factor. Additionally, different extracts of Rhizoma Coptis and berberine were tested by the developed method. The results suggested that both the EtOAc extract and berberine were able to activate PPARa/b/g, and Rhizoma Coptis contains potential natural agonists of PPARs besides berberine. In conclusion, the developed HTS assay is a simple, rapid, stable, and specific method for the screening of PPARs natural agonists.

16365052|t|Identification of the regulatory region of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene in mouse liver by hydrodynamics-based gene transfection.
16365052|a|Expression of L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) is upregulated in the liver by dietary carbohydrate. Previously, 3 carbohydrate/insulin response elements were identified in the 5'-flanking region of the L-PK gene up to bp -170. Studies of the 5'-flanking region beyond bp -183 in transgenic mice suggested that other regulatory elements may be present upstream of bp -183, but the positions of these elements were uncertain. In the present study, the existence of regulatory regions of the L-PK gene responding to stimulation by feeding was examined using in vivo hydrodynamics-based gene transfection (HT) in mouse liver. The firefly-luciferase (FL) gene, fused with various lengths of the 5'-flanking region of the L-PK gene, was introduced into mouse liver by HT. The mice had free access to a high-carbohydrate diet. In liver homogenate, luciferase activity of pL-PK(-1467)-FL (which included the 5'-flanking region from bp -1467 to +17), was markedly stimulated by feeding. 5'-Deletion up to bp -1065 caused only minor changes in luciferase activity, but further deletion up to bp -690 and bp -203 caused significant, gradual decreases in activity. Further analyses utilizing 5'-deletion mutants indicated the existence of positive regulatory regions that respond to stimulation by feeding between bp -1065 and -945, and between -300 and -203 on the L-PK gene. These results suggest that unidentified cis-acting DNA elements exist in the upstream region of the L-PK gene, and that HT is a useful approach for detecting regulatory regions of genes expressed in the liver.

11034389|t|Conformational epitopes on the diabetes autoantigen GAD65 identified by peptide phage display and molecular modeling.
11034389|a|The major diabetes autoantigen, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), contains a region of sequence similarity, including six identical residues PEVKEK, to the P2C protein of coxsackie B virus, suggesting that cross-reactivity between coxsackie B virus and GAD65 can initiate autoimmune diabetes. We used the human islet cell mAbs MICA3 and MICA4 to identify the Ab epitopes of GAD65 by screening phage-displayed random peptide libraries. The identified peptide sequences could be mapped to a homology model of the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) binding domain of GAD65. For MICA3, a surface loop containing the sequence PEVKEK and two adjacent exposed helixes were identified in the PLP binding domain as well as a region of the C terminus of GAD65 that has previously been identified as critical for MICA3 binding. To confirm that the loop containing the PEVKEK sequence contributes to the MICA3 epitope, this loop was deleted by mutagenesis. This reduced binding of MICA3 by 70%. Peptide sequences selected using MICA4 were rich in basic or hydroxyl-containing amino acids, and the surface of the GAD65 PLP-binding domain surrounding Lys358, which is known to be critical for MICA4 binding, was likewise rich in these amino acids. Also, the two phage most reactive with MICA4 encoded the motif VALxG, and the reverse of this sequence, LAV, was located in this same region. Thus, we have defined the MICA3 and MICA4 epitopes on GAD65 using the combination of phage display, molecular modeling, and mutagenesis and have provided compelling evidence for the involvement of the PEVKEK loop in the MICA3 epitope.

19389876|t|Effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetic profile of ambrisentan.
19389876|a|Ambrisentan is an endothelin type A (ET(A))-selective receptor antagonist that is metabolized primarily by glucuronidation but also undergoes oxidative metabolism by CYP3A4. The potential for ketoconazole, the archetypal strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of ambrisentan and its oxidative metabolite, 4-hydroxymethyl ambrisentan, was assessed in an open-label, nonrandomized, 2-period, single-sequence study in 16 healthy men. Participants received a single dose of ambrisentan 10 mg alone and after 4 days of ketoconazole 400 mg administered once daily. In the presence of multiple doses of ketoconazole, single-dose ambrisentan AUC(0-infinity) estimate was increased by 35.3%, whereas C(max) was increased by 20.0%. For the 4-hydroxymethyl ambrisentan metabolite, AUC(0-infinity) estimate was decreased by 4.0%, whereas C(max) was decreased by 16.5%. Concomitant administration of ambrisentan and ketoconazole was well tolerated. In summary, ketoconazole had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or safety profile of ambrisentan; therefore, no changes in ambrisentan dose should be necessary when the drug is administered concomitantly with known CYP3A4 inhibitors.

18633030|t|Synergy between pairs of competitive antagonists at adult human muscle acetylcholine receptors.
18633030|a|BACKGROUND: Synergistic neuromuscular blocking effects have been observed clinically with certain pairs of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) competitive antagonists. The mechanism for synergy has not been elucidated. We tested the hypothesis that synergy arises from a differential selectivity of antagonists for the two ligand binding sites on adult human nAChR. METHODS: We expressed nAChR in BOSC23 cells. We applied ACh with or without antagonists to outside-out patches and measured macroscopic currents at room temperature. We determined the IC(90) for (+)-tubocurarine, metocurine, pancuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, rocuronium, and atracurium. For 15 combinations of two antagonists, we determined the IC(90) for one antagonist in the presence of the IC(70) of a second antagonist. We constructed isobolograms for 90% inhibition. For single antagonists, we measured inhibition of receptors containing mutations in the epsilon- and delta-subunits to determine site selectivity. RESULTS: Two pairs of antagonists, metocurine+cisatracurium and cisatracurium+ atracurium exhibited additive inhibition. Ten combinations, including (+)-tubocurarine+ pancuronium and pancuronium+vecuronium, were highly synergistic such that the combination was two to three times more effective than expected for additivity. Three combinations were 1.5-1.6 times more effective than expected for additivity. Inhibition by (+)-tubocurarine and metocurine was sensitive to mutations in the epsilon-subunit only. Vecuronium was affected by the delta-subunit mutation only. Inhibition by other antagonists was decreased by mutations in either subunit. CONCLUSIONS: Many combinations of antagonists exhibited synergistic effects on adult human nAChR. Synergy was observed with structurally similar and dissimilar antagonists. The degree of synergy did not always correlate well with site specificity assayed with mutants. In some, but not all cases, the synergy at the receptor level correlated with clinical determinations of synergy. We conclude that the synergistic actions of muscle relaxants can be partially explained by direct interactions with adult human nAChR.

23535516|t|Modulation of the JAK/ERK/STAT signaling in melanocortin-induced inhibition of local and systemic responses to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion.
23535516|a|The janus kinases (JAK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways have been shown to play a cardioprotective role. We previously gave evidence that melanocortins afford cardioprotection in conditions of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Here we aimed to investigate the influence of melanocortins on the JAK/ERK/STAT signaling in cardiac and systemic responses to prolonged myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Ischemia was produced in rats by ligature of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30min. At the end of the 2-h reperfusion, western blot analysis of the cardioprotective transcription factors pJAK2, pERK1/2, pTyr-STAT3 and pSer-STAT3, the inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), the pro-apoptotic factors BAX and c-jun N-terminal kinases (pJNK), the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL, as well as of the cardioprotective enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), was performed in the left ventricle and spleen. Intravenous treatment, during coronary artery occlusion, with the melanocortin analogs [Nle(4), D-Phe(7)]a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (NDP-a-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone 1-24 [ACTH-(1-24)], induced a left ventricle up-regulation of pJAK2, pERK1/2 and pTyr-STAT3 (JAK-dependent), and a reduction in pJNK and TNF-a levels; these effects of NDP-a-MSH and ACTH-(1-24) were associated with over-expression of the pro-survival proteins HO-1 and Bcl-XL, and marked decrease of the myocardial infarct size. Melanocortin treatment did not affect left ventricle pSer-STAT3 (ERK1/2-dependent) and BAX levels. In the spleen, NDP-a-MSH and ACTH-(1-24) induced similar effects on the expression of the above transcription factors/proteins, except for pERK1/2 (down-regulated) and HO-1 (unaffected). Blockade of JAK and ERK pathways with AG490 and U0126, respectively, abrogated the myocardial infarct size reduction by NDP-a-MSH. These results indicate that melanocortins inhibit local and systemic inflammatory and apoptotic cascades triggered by prolonged myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, with consequent reduction in myocardium infarct size, seemingly via activation of the JAK/STAT signaling and with modulation of an ERK (STAT unrelated) signaling pathway.

22824191|t|Propranolol restores cognitive deficits and improves amyloid and Tau pathologies in a senescence-accelerated mouse model.
22824191|a|Ageing is associated with a deterioration of cognitive performance and with increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Hypertension is the most-prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, and clinical data suggest that hypertension is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study we tested whether propranolol, a b-receptor antagonist commonly used as antihypertensive drug, could ameliorate the cognitive impairments and increases in AD-related markers shown by the senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8). Propranolol administration (5 mg/kg for 3 weeks) to 6-month-old SAMP8 mice attenuated cognitive memory impairments shown by these mice in the novel object recognition test. In the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice it has been found increases in Ab(42) levels, the principal constituent of amyloid plaques observed in AD, accompanied by both an increased expression of the cleaving enzyme BACE1 and a decreased expression of the degrading enzyme IDE. All these effects were reversed by propranolol treatment. Tau hyperphosphorylation (PHF-1 epitope) shown by SAMP8 mice at this age was also decreased in the hippocampus of propranolol-treated mice, an effect probably related to a decrease in JNK1 expression. Interestingly, propranolol also phosphorylated Akt in SAMP8 mice, which was associated with an increase of glycogen synthase kinase-3b phosphorylation, contributing therefore to the reductions in Tau hyperphosphorylation. Synaptic pathology in SAMP8 mice, as shown by decreases in synaptophysin and BDNF, was also counteracted by propranolol treatment. Overall, propranolol might be beneficial in age-related brain dysfunction and could be an emerging candidate for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.

14725487|a|Sepracor in the US is developing arformoterol [R,R-formoterol], a single isomer form of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist formoterol [eformoterol]. This isomer contains two chiral centres and is being developed as an inhaled preparation for the treatment of respiratory disorders. Sepracor believes that arformoterol has the potential to be a once-daily therapy with a rapid onset of action and a duration of effect exceeding 12 hours. In 1995, Sepracor acquired New England Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer of metered-dose and dry powder inhalers, for the purpose of preparing formulations of levosalbutamol and arformoterol. Phase II dose-ranging clinical studies of arformoterol as a longer-acting, complementary bronchodilator were completed successfully in the fourth quarter of 2000. Phase III trials of arformoterol began in September 2001. The indications for the drug appeared to be asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, an update of the pharmaceutical product information on the Sepracor website in September 2003 listed COPD maintenance therapy as the only indication for arformoterol. In October 2002, Sepracor stated that two pivotal phase III studies were ongoing in 1600 patients. Sepracor estimates that its NDA submission for arformoterol, which is projected for the first half of 2004, will include approximately 3000 adult subjects. Sepracor stated in July 2003 that it had completed more than 100 preclinical studies and initiated or completed 15 clinical studies for arformoterol inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchospasm in patients with COPD. In addition, Sepracor stated that the two pivotal phase III studies in 1600 patients were still progressing. In 1995, European patents were granted to Sepracor for the use of arformoterol in the treatment of asthma, and the US patent application was pending.

1590750|t|Genetic polymorphism and activities of human lung alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases: implications for ethanol metabolism and cytotoxicity.
1590750|a|Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) exhibit genetic polymorphism and tissue specificity. ADH and ALDH isozyme phenotypes from 39 surgical Chinese lung specimens were identified by agarose isoelectric focusing. The identity of the lung beta-ADHs was further demonstrated by their characteristic pH-activity profiles for ethanol oxidation, Km values for NAD and ethanol, and inhibition by 4-methylpyrazole or 1,10-phenanthroline. The beta 2 allele, coding for beta 2 polypeptide, was found to be predominant in the lung specimens studied. The ADH activities in the lungs with the homozygous phenotype ADH2 2-2 (exhibiting beta 2 beta 2) and ADH2 1-1 (exhibiting beta 1 beta 1) and the heterozygous phenotype ADH2 2-1 (exhibiting beta 2 beta 2, beta 2 beta 1, and beta 1 beta 1) were determined to be 999 +/- 77, 48 +/- 17, and 494 +/- 61 nmol/min/g tissue, respectively. Fifty-one percent of the specimens studied lacked the ALDH2 activity band on the isoelectric focusing gels. The activities in the lung tissues with the ALDH2-active phenotype and the inactive phenotype were determined to be 30 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 1 nmol/min/g tissue, respectively. These findings indicate that human pulmonary ethanol-metabolizing activities differ significantly with respect to genetic polymorphism at both the ADH2 and the ALDH2 loci. The results suggest that individuals with high Vmax beta 2-ADH and deficient in low-Km mitochondrial ALDH2, accounting for approximately 45% of the Chinese population, may end up with acetaldehyde accumulation during alcohol consumption, rendering them vulnerable to tissue injury caused by this highly reactive and toxic metabolite.

17221210|t|Regulation of pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation by sulphated proteoglycans.
17221210|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Epithelium-mesenchyme interactions play a major role in pancreas development. Recently, we demonstrated that embryonic pancreatic mesenchyme enhanced progenitor cell proliferation but inhibited endocrine cell differentiation. Here, we investigated the role played by sulphated proteoglycans, which are known to be essential to embryonic development, in this inhibitory effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We first determined the expression of the genes encoding glypicans, syndecans and the main glycosaminoglycan chain-modifying enzymes in immature embryonic day (E) 13.5 and more differentiated E17.5 rat pancreases. Next, using an in vitro model of pancreas development, we blocked the action of endogenous sulphated proteoglycans by treating embryonic pancreases in culture with chlorate, an inhibitor of proteoglycan sulphation, and examined the effects on pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation. RESULTS: We first showed that expression of the genes encoding glypicans 1, 2, 3 and 5 and heparan sulphate 2-sulfotransferase decreased between E13.5 and E17.5. We next found that alteration of proteoglycan action by chlorate blocked the inhibitory effect of the mesenchyme on endocrine differentiation. Chlorate-treated pancreases exhibited a dramatic increase in beta cell number in a dose-dependent manner (169-and 375-fold increase with 30 mmol/l and 40 mmol/l chlorate, respectively) and in alpha cell development. Insulin-positive cells that developed in the presence of chlorate exhibited a phenotype of mature cells with regard to the expression of the following genes: pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 (Pdx1), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (Pcsk1; previously known as pro-hormone convertase 1/3), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 2 (Pcsk2; previously known as pro-hormone convertase 2) and solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 2 (Slc2a1; previously known as glucose transporter 2). Finally, we showed that chlorate activated endocrine cell development by inducing neurogenin 3 (Neurog3) expression in early endocrine progenitor cells. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We demonstrated that sulphated proteoglycans control pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation. Understanding the mechanism by which sulphated proteoglycans affect beta cell development could be useful in the generation of beta cells from embryonic stem cells.

1279186|t|Inhibition by pentosan polysulfate (PPS) of heparin-binding growth factors released from tumor cells and blockage by PPS of tumor growth in animals.
1279186|a|BACKGROUND: In a proliferating tumor, locally secreted polypeptide growth factors, which have autocrine and paracrine functions, induce vascularization essential for tumor growth and metastasis. These growth factors may serve as targets for tumor therapy. We have shown that the heparinoid pentosan polysulfate (PPS) can block growth of subcutaneous human tumor xenografts in nude mice and angiogenesis induced by the heparin-binding, Kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor (K-FGF). PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether PPS might also interfere with stimulation of endothelial cells by other growth factors released from tumor cells and whether the promising antitumor effects of PPS extend to other human tumor cell lines. We studied the effects of PPS on stimulation by heparin-binding growth factors released from seven human tumor cell lines in vitro and on tumors growing from these cell lines in athymic nude mice. METHODS: Seven human cell lines established from breast, prostate, epidermoid, and lung carcinomas and rhabdomyosarcoma were used in in vivo as well as in vitro studies of the effects of PPS. We also studied in vitro the effects of PPS on growth factor-induced colony formation of normal rat kidney fibroblasts and human adrenal carcinoma cells. RESULTS: The tumor cell lines released growth factors into their media that stimulated growth of endothelial and epithelial cells as well as fibroblasts. Heparin-affinity chromatography showed that heparin-binding growth factors contributed substantially to this paracrine activity and that PPS inhibited this stimulus. Six of the seven tumor cell lines were resistant to PPS in soft-agar cloning assays and hence did not appear to depend on autocrine stimulation by the heparin-binding growth factors. In contrast to this in vitro resistance, subcutaneous growth of tumors from all cell lines in athymic nude mice was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by daily intraperitoneal injections of PPS. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that heparin-binding growth factors contribute substantially to tumor growth in vivo and that PPS acts by blocking the paracrine effects of heparin-binding growth factors released from the tumor cells. IMPLICATION: PPS could become a novel treatment tool targeting tumor growth factors.

17596133|t|The genetic interaction between VKORC1 c1173t and calumenin a29809g modulates the anticoagulant response of acenocoumarol.
17596133|a|BACKGROUND: The efficacy of oral anticoagulant therapy is largely conditioned by both environmental and genetic factors. OBJECTIVES: To attempt to define the genetic profile involved in the response to this treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 100 men younger than 75 years, with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, who started anticoagulation with acenocoumarol following the same protocol: 3 mg for three consecutive days. Then, doses were individually adjusted to achieve a steady International Normalized Ratio (INR). The basal plasma level and the level after 3 days were obtained, and the INR was determined. We studied five functional polymorphisms: FVII -323 Del/Ins, CYP2C*9, VKORC1 c1173t, calumenin (CALU) R4Q and CALU a29809g. The dose required for a steady INR was also recorded. RESULTS: Only the VKORC1 genotype had significant impact on the efficacy of therapy. Carriers of the 1173t allele were significantly more sensitive to therapy for 3 days [INR 2.07 (1.59-2.87) vs. 1.74 (1.30-2.09); P = 0.015] and they needed lower acenocoumarol doses to stabilize their INR (15.8 +/- 5.6 vs. 19.5 +/- 6.0 mg week(-1); P = 0.004). Its effect was exacerbated by combination with the CALU a29809g polymorphism. Carriers of both variants (27% of the sample) achieved the highest INR [2.26 (1.70-3.32)] and required the lowest dose (14.1 +/- 5.1 mg week(-1)). This genetic profile was particularly relevant in patients with INR >or= 3.5 at the start of therapy (P = 0.005; odds ratio = 6.67, 95% confidence interval = 1.32-37.43). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CALU a29809g might be a new genetic factor involved in the pharmacogenetics of anticoagulant therapy, and confirm that specific genetic profiles defined by different polymorphisms will determine the initial response and dose required to achieve a stable and safe INR.

17311416|t|Pre-steady-state currents in neutral amino acid transporters induced by photolysis of a new caged alanine derivative.
17311416|a|Na+-Dependent transmembrane transport of small neutral amino acids, such as glutamine and alanine, is mediated, among others, by the neutral amino acid transporters of the solute carrier 1 [SLC1, alanine serine cysteine transporter 1 (ASCT1), and ASCT2] and SLC38 families [sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 1 (SNAT1), SNAT2, and SNAT4]. Many mechanistic aspects of amino acid transport by these systems are not well-understood. Here, we describe a new photolabile alanine derivative based on protection of alanine with the 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl (MNI) caging group, which we use for pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of alanine transport by ASCT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2. MNI-alanine has favorable photochemical properties and is stable in aqueous solution. It is also inert with respect to the transport systems studied. Photolytic release of free alanine results in the generation of significant transient current components in HEK293 cells expressing the ASCT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2 proteins. In ASCT2, these currents show biphasic decay with time constants, tau, in the 1-30 ms time range. They are fully inhibited in the absence of extracellular Na+, demonstrating that Na+ binding to the transporter is necessary for induction of the alanine-mediated current. For SNAT1, these transient currents differ in their time course (tau = 1.6 ms) from previously described pre-steady-state currents generated by applying steps in the membrane potential (tau approximately 4-5 ms), indicating that they are associated with a fast, previously undetected, electrogenic partial reaction in the SNAT1 transport cycle. The implications of these results for the mechanisms of transmembrane transport of alanine are discussed. The new caged alanine derivative will provide a useful tool for future, more detailed studies of neutral amino acid transport.

23580316|t|Anti-Ulcerative Colitis Activity of Compounds from Euphorbia granuleta Forssk.
23580316|a|The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-ulcerative colitis (UC) activity of the total alcohol extracts of Euphorbia granuleta Forssk. (Euphorpiaceae), isolate and identify the active compounds that could be responsible for the activity, in addition to determination of the possible mechanism of action. Six compounds were isolated and identified from this plant: three phenolic compounds (kampferol, kampferol-3-glucoside and kampferol-3-galactoside) in addition to three steroidal compounds (1-ethoxypentacosane, heptacosan-1-ol and b-sitosterol). Three compounds (heptacosan-1-ol, b-sitosterol and kampferol-3-galactoside) were found to be responsible for the anti-UC activity of E. granuleta extract. The anti-UC activity of these compounds may be explained by reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), in addition to reduction of colonic malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. No side effects were reported on liver and kidney functions. The active compounds reduced both serum TNF-a and mucosal MDA levels. Copyright    2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

17016621|t|Enhancement of radiosensitivity by topoisomerase II inhibitor, amrubicin and amrubicinol, in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and kinetics of apoptosis and necrosis induction.
17016621|a|The effects of amrubicin (AMR) and its active metabolite, amrubicinol (AMROH), on the sensitivity of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells to ionizing radiation were investigated in vitro. Further, the kinetics of apoptosis and necrosis induction were also analyzed. The cytocidal effects of X-ray irradiation on A549 cells resulted in a low level of radiosensitivity with a D0 value of 12 Gy. The slopes of the survival curves in the exponential phase were plotted on semilogarithmic paper for radiation combined with AMR (2.5 microg/ml) and AMROH (0.02 microg/ml) treatment, and were shown to be approximately parallel to treatment with irradiation alone. The initial shoulder-shape portion of the survival curve for radiation alone, indicating the repair of sublethal damage, was reduced as compared to that for sequential combined treatment with AMR or AMROH. Sequential treatments with AMR or AMROH prior to ionizing radiation resulted in an additive radio-enhancement effect that reduced not only survival, but also the shoulder width. Fractionated irradiation with 2 Gy per fraction of A549 cells was carried out in vitro similar to that commonly performed in clinical radiotherapy and the radio-resistance of the cells was shown to be inhibited by AMR and AMROH. Similar to AMR and AMROH, adriamycin and etoposide (VP-16) are DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors. The effects of these 4 agents on cells that received X-ray irradiation were compared and all of the agents exhibited comparable radio-enhancement effects. The induction of apoptosis was investigated at 48 and 72 h after administration of AMROH, radiation or combined treatment, and apoptosis was not significantly induced after any of the treatments. We also examined the induction of necrosis, and found that the incidence of necrosis following combined treatment was approximately 2 times higher than that with either of the single treatments.

23531488|t|Transport Function and Transcriptional Regulation of a Liver-Enriched Human Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 Transcriptional Start Site Variant.
23531488|a|Human Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1) is a membrane transporter that facilitates the cellular uptake of a number of endogenous compounds and drugs. OATP2B1 is widely expressed in tissues including the small intestine, liver, kidney, placenta, heart, skeletal muscle and platelets. Recently, it has been shown that differential promoter usage in tissues results in expression of five OATP2B1 transcriptional start site variants which utilize distinct first exons but share common subsequent exons. These variants are expected to encode either a full length (OATP2B1-FL) or shortened protein lacking 22 N-terminus amino acids (OATP2B-Short). Little is known regarding the transport activity and regulation of OATP2B1 variants with N-terminus truncation. Here, using absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction we find the full length variant is the major form expressed in duodenum but the short variant predominates in liver. Using a transient heterologous cell expression system, we find that the transport activities of the short OATP2B1 variant towards substrates estrone sulfate and rosuvastatin are similar to the well-characterized full length variant. Transcriptional activity screening of the liver enriched OATP2B1 variant promoter identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4a) as a novel transacting factor. With a combination of in silico screening, promoter mutation in cell-based reporter assays, siRNA knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, we identified a functional HNF4a binding site close to the transcription start site (-17 to -4 bp). We conclude that the major OATP2B1 protein form in liver is transport competent and its hepatic expression is regulated by HNF4a.

12244038|t|Gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibits the induction of nitric-oxide synthase in human astrocytes.
12244038|a|Gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibited cytokine-induced production of NO and the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astrocytes. Similar to gemfibrozil, clofibrate, another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of iNOS. Inhibition of human iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity by gemfibrozil in cytokine-stimulated U373MG astroglial cells suggests that this compound inhibits the transcription of iNOS. Since gemfibrozil is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), we investigated the role of PPAR-alpha in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS. Gemfibrozil induced peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE)-dependent luciferase activity, which was inhibited by the expression of DeltahPPAR-alpha, the dominant-negative mutant of human PPAR-alpha. However, DeltahPPAR-alpha was unable to abrogate gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits iNOS independent of PPAR-alpha. The human iNOS promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) binding to gamma-activation site (GAS), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta); therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these transcription factors. The combination of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IFN-gamma induced the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, C/EBPbeta, and GAS but not that of ISRE, suggesting that IRF-1 may not be involved in cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in human astrocytes. Interestingly, gemfibrozil strongly inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta but not that of GAS in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells. These results suggest that gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of iNOS probably by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.

11775064|t|Effects of the antidepressant/antipanic drug phenelzine on alanine and alanine transaminase in rat brain.
11775064|a|1. Phenelzine (PLZ) is an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties. Acute and chronic PLZ administration increase brain GABA levels, an effect due, at least in part, to an inhibition of the activity of the GABA metabolizing enzyme, GABA transaminase (GABA-T). 2. Previous preliminary reports have indicated that acute PLZ treatment also elevates brain alanine levels. As with GABA, the metabolism of alanine involves a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transaminase. 3. In the study reported here, the effects of acute PLZ treatment on the levels of various amino acids, some of which are also metabolized by pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transaminases were compared in rat whole brain. Of the 6 amino acids investigated, only GABA and alanine levels were elevated (in a time- and dose-dependent manner). 4. The elevation in brain alanine levels could be explained, at least in part, by a time- and dose-dependent inhibitory effect of PLZ on alanine transaminase (ALA-T), although as with GABA the increases are higher than expected from the degree of enzyme inhibition produced. In addition, we also showed that the elevation in alanine levels and the inhibition of alanine transaminase in the brain are retained after 14 days of PLZ treatment, and that PLZ produces a marked increase in extracellular levels of alanine. 5. These results are discussed in terms of their relevance to synaptic function and to the pharmacological profile of PLZ.

23333577|t|Suppression of Src/ERK and GSK-3/b-catenin signaling by pinosylvin inhibits the growth of human colorectal cancer cells.
23333577|a|Pinosylvin, a naturally occurring trans-stilbenoid mainly found in Pinus species, has exhibited a potential cancer chemopreventive activity. However, the growth inhibitory activity against cancer cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the anti-proliferative activity of pinosylvin was investigated in human colorectal HCT 116 cancer cells. Pinosylvin inhibited the proliferation of HCT 116 cells by arresting transition of cell cycle from G1 to S phase along with the downregulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A, cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK4, c-Myc, and retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and the upregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p53. Pinosylvin was also found to attenuate the activation of proteins involved in focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/c-Src/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/ glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK-3b) signaling pathway. Subsequently, pinosylvin suppressed the nuclear translocation of b-catenin, one of downstream molecules of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3b signaling, and these events led to the sequential downregulation of b-catenin-mediated transcription of target genes including BMP4, ID2, survivin, cyclin D1, MMP7, and c-Myc. These findings demonstrate that the anti-proliferative activity of pinosylvin might be associated with the cell cycle arrest and downregulation of cell proliferation regulating signaling pathways in human colorectal cancer cells.

23353741|t|Synthesis and biological evaluation of some novel resveratrol amide derivatives as potential anti-tumor agents.
23353741|a|Three series of novel resveratrol amide derivatives (1a-q, 2a-h, 3a-l) were synthesized and evaluated for their biological activities. All compounds were characterized by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. Furthermore, compound 3e was also characterized by X-ray crystallography. All the compounds were evaluated for their anti-tumor activity against MCF-7, A549 and B16-F10 tumor cell lines as well as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) inhibitory activity of murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line. Among them, compounds 1c, 1g and 3e displayed the most potent COX-2 inhibitory activity with the IC50 values of 1.02, 1.27 and 1.98 uM, respectively. Molecular docking studies were performed to position compounds 1c and 3e into the active site of COX-2 to determine the probable binding modes.

23428155|a|The solubility-driven structural modification of (pyridin-3-yl) benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinones is described, which resulted in the development of a new series of benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinone analogues with high antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including that against linezolid-resistant strains and low hERG inhibition. With regard to structure-activity relationship (SAR) trends among the various substituents on the pyridyl ring, relatively small and nonbasic substituents were preferable to sterically demanding or basic substituents. Oxazolidinone ring substitution on the pyridyl ring generated analogues with antibacterial activity superior to imidazolidinone ring. Solubility was enhanced by the incorporation of polar groups, especially when compounds were converted to their prodrugs. Among the prodrugs, compound 85 exhibited excellent solubility and a good pharmacokinetic profile. In a MRSA systemic infection model, compound 85 displayed an ED50 = 5.00 mg/kg, a potency that is 2-fold better than that of linezolid.

23313633|t|Predictive modeling of insulin release profile from cross-linked chitosan microspheres.
23313633|a|Insulin-loaded microspheres composed of chitosan 3% (w/v), and loading 120 IU insulin were produced by emulsion cross-linking method. Cross-linking time was 5 h and glutaraldehyde 3.5% (v/v) was used as cross-linker. Swelling ratio studies were evaluated to predict release of insulin from chitosan microspheres. Bacitracin and sodium taurocholate were incorporated in the formulations as proteolytic enzyme inhibitor and absorption enhancer, respectively. In vitro insulin release studies were performed in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and also in HCl pH 2 with and without trypsin. Activity of bacitracin was also evaluated. In vitro release showed a controlled profile up to 12 h and the formulation containing 0.15% (w/v) of bacitracin revealed a maximum biological activity of about 49.1 + 4.1%. Mathematical modeling using Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas suggested a non-Fickian diffusion as the mechanism of insulin release. Insulin-loaded chitosan microspheres for oral delivery showed to be an innovative and reliable delivery system to overcome conventional insulin therapy.

23400796|t|The accumulation of metal (Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Zn) in freshwater Ulva (Chlorophyta) and its habitat.
23400796|a|The possibility of using freshwater Ulva (Chlorophyta) as a bioaccumulator of metals (Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Zn) in lake and river water was examined weekly in the summer of 2010 in three types of samples: the water, the sediment and the thalli of Ulva. Samples of freshwater Ulva were collected from two aqueous ecosystems lie 250 km away from the basin of the Baltic Sea and 53 km from each other. A flow lake located in the centre of the big city was the first water reservoir (ten sites) and second, the suburban river (six sites). The mean metal concentrations in the Ulva tissue from the river and the lake decreased in the following order: Mn > Zn > Cr > Cu > Co and Mn > Cr > Zn > Cu > Co, respectively. Moreover, a negative and statistically significant correlation between Mn concentrations in the Ulva thalli and the river water was observed. Additionally, numerous correlations were noted between the different concentrations of metals within the Ulva thalli, in the water and in the sediment. The great concentrations of Mn and Zn and the smallest of Co were found in thalli of Ulva, irrespective of the type of the ecosystem from which samples of algal thalli originated. Freshwater Ulva populations examined in this study were clearly characterized a dozen or so times by the higher Mn and Cr accumulation than taxa from that genera coming from sea ecosystems. The calculated bioconcentration factor confirm the high potential for freshwater Ulva to be a bioaccumulator of trace metals in freshwater ecosystems.

21712771|t|Vesicular monoamine transporter-1 (VMAT-1) mRNA and immunoreactive proteins in mouse brain.
21712771|a|OBJECTIVE: Vesicular monoamine transporter 1 (VMAT-1) mRNA and protein were examined (1) to determine whether adult mouse brain expresses full-length VMAT-1 mRNA that can be translated to functional transporter protein and (2) to compare immunoreactive VMAT-1 proteins in brain and adrenal. METHODS: VMAT-1 mRNA was detected in mouse brain with RT-PCR. The cDNA was sequenced, cloned into an expression vector, transfected into COS-1 cells, and cell protein was assayed for VMAT-1 activity. Immunoreactive proteins were examined on western blots probed with four different antibodies to VMAT-1. RESULTS: Sequencing confirmed identity of the entire coding sequences of VMAT-1 cDNA from mouse medulla oblongata/pons and adrenal to a Gen-Bank reference sequence. Transfection of the brain cDNA into COS-1 cells resulted in transporter activity that was blocked by the VMAT inhibitor reserpine and a proton ionophore, but not by tetrabenazine, which has a high affinity for VMAT-2. Antibodies to either the C- or N- terminus of VMAT-1 detected two proteins (73 and 55 kD) in transfected COS-1 cells. The C-terminal antibodies detected both proteins in extracts of mouse medulla/pons, cortex, hypothalamus, and cerebellum but only the 73 kD protein and higher molecular weight immunoreactive proteins in mouse adrenal and rat PC12 cells, which are positive controls for rodent VMAT-1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that a functional VMAT-1 mRNA coding sequence is expressed in mouse brain and suggest processing of VMAT-1 protein differs in mouse adrenal and brain.

23524316|t|Effect of quercetin-rich onion peel extracts on arterial thrombosis in rats.
23524316|a|The aim of this study was to examine whether oral supplementation of quercetin-rich onion peel extract (OPE) influences blood coagulation and arterial thrombosis in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. 24 male rats, 5weeks old, were divided into three groups with different diets (C: control, 2mg OPE: chow diet with 2mg OPE supplementation, 10mg OPE: chow diet with 10mg OPE supplementation) for 6weeks. Blood coagulation parameters including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and platelet aggregation were examined. The OPE did not affect blood cholesterol levels but significantly decreased blood triglyceride and glucose levels. PT, aPTT and platelet aggregation were not significantly different among all tested groups. However, in vivo arterial thrombosis was significantly delayed in groups that were fed 2mg and 10mg OPE diets compared to the control group. In addition, the OPE greatly diminished thrombin-induced expression of tissue factor in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), a coagulation initiator. In addition, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways activated by thrombin treatment were prevented by the OPE pre-treatment. These results indicate that OPE may have anti-thrombotic effects through restricting the induced expression of tissue factor via down-regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation upon coagulation stimulus, leading to the prolongation of time for arterial thrombosis.

19149483|t|Tyrosine kinase blockers: new hope for successful cancer therapy.
19149483|a|Tyrosine kinases (TKs) are attractive targets for cancer therapy, as quite often their abnormal signaling has been linked with tumor development and growth. Constitutive activated TKs stimulate multiple signaling pathways responsible for DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. During the last few years, thorough analysis of the mechanism underlying tyrosine kinase's activity led to novel cancer therapy using TKs blockers. These drugs are remarkably effective in the treatment of various human tumors including head and neck, gastric, prostate and breast cancer and leukemias. The most successful example of kinase blockers is Imatinib (Imatinib mesylate, Gleevec, STI571), the inhibitor of Bcr/Abl oncoprotein, which has become a first-line therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia. The introduction of STI571 for the treatment of leukemia in clinical oncology has had a dramatic impact on how this disease is currently managed. Others kinase inhibitors used recently in cancer therapy include Dasatinib (BMS-354825) specific for ABL non-receptor cytoplasmic kinase, Gefitinib (Iressa), Erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva) and Sunitinib (SU 11248, Sutent) specific for VEGF receptor kinase, AMN107 (Nilotinib) and INNO-406 (NS-187) specific for c-KIT kinase. The following TK blockers for treatment of various human tumors are in clinical development: Lapatinib (Lapatinib ditosylate, Tykerb, GW-572016), Canertinib (CI-1033), Zactima (ZD6474), Vatalanib (PTK787/ZK 222584), Sorafenib (Bay 43-9006, Nexavar), and Leflunomide (SU101, Arava). Herein, we discuss the chemistry, biological activity and clinical potential of new drugs with tyrosine kinase blockers for cancer treatment.

16741658|t|Expression of basic fibroblast growth factor correlates with resistance to paclitaxel in human patient tumors.
16741658|a|BACKGROUND: Preclinical results indicate acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) present in solid tumors as a cause of broad-spectrum chemoresistance, whereas earlier clinical studies suggest that bFGF expression is associated with opposing outcomes in patients. We investigated the relationship between FGF expression and paclitaxel activity in tumors from bladder, breast, head and neck, ovarian, and prostate cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumors (n = 96) were maintained in three-dimensional histocultures, retaining tumor-stromal interaction. Bladder tumors were treated with paclitaxel for 2 h, and the other tumors for 24 h. Antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of paclitaxel were quantified and correlated with expression of aFGF, bFGF, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), p53, and bcl-2. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent (49/96) and 63% (61/96) of tumors showed aFGF and bFGF staining, respectively. aFGF expression was positively correlated with tumor stage (p < 0.01), and bFGF expression with tumor grade and Pgp expression (p < 0.05). Paclitaxel inhibited antiproliferation in 86% of tumors (83/96), with an average inhibition of 46 +/- 19% (mean +/- SD) in the responding tumors. Paclitaxel also induced apoptosis in 96% of tumors (92/96), with an average apoptotic index of 12 +/- 7% in the responding tumors. aFGF expression did not correlate with tumor sensitivity to paclitaxel, whereas bFGF expression showed an inverse correlation (p < 0.01). bFGF expression was a stronger predictor of paclitaxel resistance compared to Pgp, p53, or Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: These results support a role of bFGF in paclitaxel resistance in human patient tumors.

14583450|t|The human ribonucleotide reductase subunit hRRM2 complements p53R2 in response to UV-induced DNA repair in cells with mutant p53.
14583450|a|Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) is responsible for the de novo conversion of the ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, which are essential for DNA synthesis and repair. RR consists of two subunits, hRRM1 and hRRM2. p53R2 is a new RR family member. Because the majority of human tumors possess mutant p53, it is important to know the molecular mechanism by which mutant p53 regulates RR and to what extent. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of p53R2 and hRRM2 after UV treatment in human prostate cancer PC3 cells, which possess mutant p53 with a truncated COOH-terminal, and in human oropharyngeal cancer KB cells, which possess wild-type p53. p53R2 (analyzed by Western blot and standardized relative to Coomassie Blue-stained band) was down-regulated in PC3 cells and up-regulated in KB cells after UV exposure. In contrast, hRRM2 was up-regulated by UV in both PC3 cells and KB cells. hRRM2 and p53R2 mRNA levels were assessed by Northern blot, and the results paralleled that of the Western blot. Coimmunoprecipitation assays using agarose-conjugated goat antihuman RRM1 antibody confirmed that the p53R2 binding to hRRM1 decreased in PC3 cells but increased in KB cells after UV treatment. hRRM2 binding to hRRM1 increased in both cell lines under the same conditions. These results suggest that PC3 cells are deficient in both transcription of p53R2 and binding to hRRM1 in response to UV irradiation. Confocal microscopy further confirmed that these findings were not due to translocation of hRRM2 and p53R2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. RR activity was measured following UV treatment and shown to increase in PC3 cells. It was unchanged in proportional of KB cells. The RR activity is consistent with the expression of hRRM2 seen in the Western blots. Thus, we hypothesize that hRRM2 complements p53R2 to form RR holoenzyme and maintain RR activity in PC3 cells after UV treatment. To further confirm this hypothesis, we examined the effect of RRM2 inhibitors on cells exposed to UV. In PC3 cells, hydroxyurea inhibited hRRM2 and resulted in increased sensitivity to UV irradiation. We also examined the effect of UV treatment on the colony-forming ability of cells transfected with hRRM2 as well as p53R2 sense or antisense expression vectors. Expression of antisense hRRM2 in PC3 cells led to decreased hRRM2 expression and resulted in greater sensitivity to UV than observed in wild-type PC3 cells. Taken together, we conclude that UV-induced activation of p53R2 transcription and binding of p53R2 to hRRM1 to form RR holoenzyme are impaired in the p53-mutant cell line PC3.

23041257|t|Apoptosis induced neurotoxicity of Di-n-butyl-di-(4-chlorobenzohydroxamato) Tin (IV) via mitochondria-mediated pathway in PC12 cells.
23041257|a|The severe toxicity of antitumor organotin (IV) compounds limits their application in clinic, however, the toxic mechanism is still unclear. Di-n-butyl-di-(4-chlorobenzohydroxamato) Tin (IV) (DBDCT), an antitumor agent with high activity and obvious neurotoxicity was chosen as a typical diorganotin (IV) compound to investigate its neurotoxic mechanism using PC12 cells and comprehensive methods. Treatment with DBDCT resulted in a dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition of PC12 cells. The changes in cell morphology were observed using light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. PC12 cell apoptosis induced by DBDCT was confirmed by annexin V/propidium iodide staining, and characterized by cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 proteins. DBDCT induced the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and the generation of reactive oxygen species. DBDCT up-regulated the expression of Bax, down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and significantly increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. DBDCT also caused the phosphorylation of JNK and p38(MAPK). In rats exposed to DBDCT, apoptosis was also observed in brain, as shown by the detection of cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 proteins and increased TUNEL positive staining. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that DBDCT caused the neurotoxicity by inducing apoptosis via mitochondria-mediated pathway.

23355087|a|Elevated urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid is considered rare in patients suspected of a metabolic disorder. In 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency (mutations in AUH), it derives from leucine degradation. In all other disorders with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria the origin is unknown, yet mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be the common denominator. We investigate the biochemical, clinical and genetic data of 388 patients referred to our centre under suspicion of a metabolic disorder showing 3-methylglutaconic aciduria in routine metabolic screening. Furthermore, we investigate 591 patients with 50 different, genetically proven, mitochondrial disorders for the presence of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. Three percent of all urine samples of the patients referred showed 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, often in correlation with disorders not reported earlier in association with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (e.g. organic acidurias, urea cycle disorders, haematological and neuromuscular disorders). In the patient cohort with genetically proven mitochondrial disorders 11 % presented 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. It was more frequently seen in ATPase related disorders, with mitochondrial DNA depletion or deletion, but not in patients with single respiratory chain complex deficiencies. Besides, it was a consistent feature of patients with mutations in TAZ, SERAC1, OPA3, DNAJC19 and TMEM70 accounting for mitochondrial membrane related pathology. 3-methylglutaconic aciduria is found quite frequently in patients suspected of a metabolic disorder, and mitochondrial dysfunction is indeed a common denominator. It is only a discriminative feature of patients with mutations in AUH, TAZ, SERAC1, OPA3, DNAJC19 TMEM70. These conditions should therefore be referred to as inborn errors of metabolism with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria as discriminative feature.

23368996|t|Structures and cytotoxic evaluation of new and known acyclic Ene-Ynes from an American Samoa Petrosia sp. Sponge.
23368996|a|Four new compounds, (-)-petrosynoic acids A-D (1-4), and five known congeners, pellynols A (5), C (6), D (7), F (8), and I (9), were isolated from a Petrosia sp. marine sponge collected in American Samoa. Isolation work was guided by cytotoxicity against human lung cancer cells (H460). The structures of the C31-C33 polyacetylenes (1-9) were determined on the basis of 1D- and 2D-NMR analysis, mass spectrometry, and comparison of specific rotation values. Compounds 1-9 were found to be broadly cytotoxic with limited selectivity for cancer cells, as they were all moderately active against the A2058 (melanoma), H522-T1 (lung), and H460 (lung) human cancer cell lines as well as IMR-90 quiescent human fibroblast cells.

11692072|t|Influence of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) exon 8 genotype on efficacy of tiapride and clinical outcome of alcohol withdrawal.
11692072|a|We tested the hypothesis that allelic variants of the human dopamine D2 receptor E8 genotype are associated with (i) dopamine D2 antagonist tiapride dose in treatment of alcohol withdrawal (n = 50) and (ii) with anxiety and depression in patients during alcoholism detoxification therapy (admission n = 87; discharge n = 50). DRD2 E8 A/A genotype was associated with increased dose of tiapride during a 9-day detoxification therapy and with increased anxiety and depression scores on admission and 2 weeks later. The findings suggest a pharmacogenetic influence of DRD2 E8 genotype on tiapride efficacy in alcohol withdrawal. In an earlier report, DRD2 E8 A/A genotype was associated with reduced responsiveness to the dopamine D2 agonist apomorphine; however, it is not clear whether both findings share the same biological basis. Earlier findings concerning association of DRD2 E8 A/A with increased anxiety and depression are replicated for the first time.

17479245|t|Glucagon receptor antagonism improves islet function in mice with insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet.
17479245|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Increased glucagon secretion predicts deterioration of glucose tolerance, and high glucagon levels contribute to hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of glucagon action may therefore be a potential novel target to reduce hyperglycaemia. Here, we investigated whether chronic treatment with a glucagon receptor antagonist (GRA) improves islet dysfunction in female mice on a high-fat diet (HFD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 8 weeks of HFD, mice were treated with a small molecule GRA (300 mg/kg, gavage once daily) for up to 30 days. Insulin secretion was studied after oral and intravenous administration of glucose and glucagon secretion after intravenous arginine. Islet morphology was examined and insulin secretion and glucose oxidation were measured in isolated islets. RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose levels were reduced by GRA (6.0 +/- 0.2 vs 7.4 +/- 0.5 mmol/l; p = 0.017). The acute insulin response to intravenous glucose was augmented (1,300 +/- 110 vs 790 +/- 64 pmol/l; p < 0.001). The early insulin response to oral glucose was reduced in mice on HFD + GRA (1,890 +/- 160 vs 3,040 +/- 420 pmol/l; p = 0.012), but glucose excursions were improved. Intravenous arginine significantly increased the acute glucagon response (129 +/- 12 vs 36 +/- 6 ng/l in controls; p < 0.01), notably without affecting plasma glucose. GRA caused a modest increase in alpha cell mass, while beta cell mass was similar to that in mice on HFD + vehicle. Isolated islets displayed improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion after GRA treatment (0.061 +/- 0.007 vs 0.030 +/- 0.004 pmol islet(-1) h(-1) at 16.7 mmol/l glucose; p < 0.001), without affecting islet glucose oxidation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Chronic glucagon receptor antagonism in HFD-fed mice improves islet sensitivity to glucose and increases insulin secretion, suggesting improvement of key defects underlying impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.

23403014|t|Stabilisation of amorphous drugs under high humidity using pharmaceutical thin films.
23403014|a|In this study, the stabilization effects of three polymers on four model drugs (felodipine, fenofibrate, carbamazepine, and celecoxib) under saturated humidity were investigated. Three different types of thin films (solid dispersions, drug films with a polymer film coating and drug films laid on top of polymer coated surfaces) were prepared and compared with films containing the drug alone. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, polarised light microscopy (PLM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nano-thermal analysis (nano-TA) were performed on the model systems after storage under saturated humidity. The recrystallisation tendency of the drug in the drug containing thin films was found to be strongly related to the intrinsic crystallization tendency of the drug film alone and the strength of drug-polymer interactions. Additionally, under high humidity, the glass transition temperature of the polymer is no longer an indicator of its drug stabilization capability. Instead, it is the hygroscobicity of the polymer that appears to be the most important parameter. Amongst the polymers tested in this study, EUDRAGIT E PO was found to have the greatest inhibitory effect on crystallization, whilst PVP K30 was found to have the least protective effect; presumably because of its hygroscopic nature.

17085856|t|Adenosine receptor antagonists intensify the benzodiazepine withdrawal signs in mice.
17085856|a|The aim of the present experiment was to assess the involvement of adenosine receptor antagonists in benzodiazepine (BDZ) withdrawal signs, observed as the seizure susceptibility in mice. The discontinuation of chronic treatment with temazepam or diazepam decreased seizure threshold (one of BDZ withdrawal signs). The concomitant application of subconvulsive dose of pentetrazole (55.0 mg/kg) with low dose of flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg) - a BDZ receptor antagonist, immediately induced BDZ withdrawal signs in these animals. The non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist (caffeine), and the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX), injected 15 min before the application of pentetrazole and flumazenil, were able to intensify BDZ withdrawal signs in mice. The most apparent effects were observed after administration of DPCPX, indicating that the adenosine A1 receptor may play a more important role in these effects. The obtained data demonstrate that the adenosinergic system is involved in BDZ withdrawal signs in mice, and adenosine A1 receptor plays an important role in this process.

17146052|t|Seizures and enhanced cortical GABAergic inhibition in two mouse models of human autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.
17146052|a|Selected mutations in the human alpha4 or beta2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes cosegregate with a partial epilepsy syndrome known as autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). To examine possible mechanisms underlying this inherited epilepsy, we engineered two ADNFLE mutations (Chrna4(S252F) and Chrna4(+L264)) in mice. Heterozygous ADNFLE mutant mice show persistent, abnormal cortical electroencephalograms with prominent delta and theta frequencies, exhibit frequent spontaneous seizures, and show an increased sensitivity to the proconvulsant action of nicotine. Relative to WT, electrophysiological recordings from ADNFLE mouse layer II/III cortical pyramidal cells reveal a >20-fold increase in nicotine-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents with no effect on excitatory postsynaptic currents. i.p. injection of a subthreshold dose of picrotoxin, a use-dependent gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor antagonist, reduces cortical electroencephalogram delta power and transiently inhibits spontaneous seizure activity in ADNFLE mutant mice. Our studies suggest that the mechanism underlying ADNFLE seizures may involve inhibitory synchronization of cortical networks via activation of mutant alpha4-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors located on the presynaptic terminals and somatodendritic compartments of cortical GABAergic interneurons.

23261645|t|The effects of jaspamide on human cardiomyocyte function and cardiac ion channel activity.
23261645|a|Jaspamide (jasplakinolide; NSC-613009) is a cyclodepsipeptide that has antitumor activity. A narrow margin of safety was observed between doses required for efficacy in mouse tumor models and doses that caused severe acute toxicity in rats and dogs. We explored the hypothesis that the observed toxicity was due to cardiotoxicity. Jaspamide was tested in a patch clamp assay to determine its effect on selected cardiac ion channels. Jaspamide (10 uM) inhibited Kv1.5 activity by 98.5%. Jaspamide also inhibited other channels including Cav1.2, Cav3.2, and HCN2; however, the Kv11.1 (hERG) channel was minimally affected. Using spontaneously contracting human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, effects on cardiomyocyte contraction and viability were also examined. Jaspamide (30 nM to 30 uM) decreased cardiomyocyte cell indices and beat amplitude, putative measurements of cell viability and cardiac contractility, respectively. Concentration-dependent increases in rhythmic beating rate were noted at < 6 h of treatment, followed by dose-dependent decreases after 6 and 72 h exposure. The toxic effects of jaspamide were compared with that of the known cardiotoxicant mitoxantrone, and confirmed by multiparameter fluorescence imaging analysis. These results support the hypothesis that the toxicity observed in rats and dogs is due to toxic effects of jaspamide on cardiomyocytes.

23142507|t|Heteromtoxin (HmTx), a novel heterodimeric phospholipase A(2) from Heterometrus laoticus scorpion venom.
23142507|a|Heteromtoxin (HmTx) is a group III phospholipase A(2) produced in Heterometrus laoticus, in Thailand. In this study, HmTx was purified from venom by separation chromatography, and the PLA(2) activity of the fractions was determined by lecithin agar assay. The enzyme is an acidic protein with a pI of 5.6 and an apparent molecular weight of 14018.4 Da. The nucleotide sequence of HmTx contains 649 bp, and the mature protein is predicted to have 131 amino acid residues-104 of which make up the large subunit, and 27 of which make up the small subunit. The subunit structure of HmTx is highly similar to that of the other toxin, Pandinus imperator imperatoxin I (IpTx(i)) and to Mesobuthus tamulus phospholipase A(2) (MtPLA(2)). The 3D-structure of HmTx consists of three conserved alpha-helices: h1 (Lys24-His34), h2 (Cys59-Asp71), and h3 (Ala80-Phe89). The beta-sheet consisted of a single stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet (b1.1 at Glu43-Lys45 and b1.2 at Lys48-Asn50) that was highly similar to the conserved sequences (-CGXG-, -CCXXHDXC- and CXCEXXXXXC-) of Apis mellifera (bee) phospholipases.

9990013|t|Cooperative binding of ATP and MgADP in the sulfonylurea receptor is modulated by glibenclamide.
9990013|a|The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in pancreatic beta cells are critical in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Although electrophysiological studies provide clues to the complex control of KATP channels by ATP, MgADP, and pharmacological agents, the molecular mechanism of KATP-channel regulation remains unclear. The KATP channel is a heterooligomeric complex of SUR1 subunits of the ATP-binding-cassette superfamily with two nucleotide-binding folds (NBF1 and NBF2) and the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits. Here, we report that MgATP and MgADP, but not the Mg salt of gamma-thio-ATP, stabilize the binding of prebound 8-azido-[alpha-32P]ATP to SUR1. Mutation in the Walker A and B motifs of NBF2 of SUR1 abolished this stabilizing effect of MgADP. These results suggest that SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP strongly at NBF1 and that MgADP, either by direct binding to NBF2 or by hydrolysis of bound MgATP at NBF2, stabilizes prebound 8-azido-ATP binding at NBF1. The sulfonylurea glibenclamide caused release of prebound 8-azido-[alpha-32P]ATP from SUR1 in the presence of MgADP or MgATP in a concentration-dependent manner. This direct biochemical evidence of cooperative interaction in nucleotide binding of the two NBFs of SUR1 suggests that glibenclamide both blocks this cooperative binding of ATP and MgADP and, in cooperation with the MgADP bound at NBF2, causes ATP to be released from NBF1.

16344985|t|Valproic acid selectively inhibits conversion of arachidonic acid to arachidonoyl-CoA by brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases: relevance to bipolar disorder.
16344985|a|RATIONALE: Several drugs used to treat bipolar disorder (lithium and carbamazepine), when administered chronically to rats, reduce the turnover of arachidonic acid, but not docosahexaenoic acid, in brain phospholipids by decreasing the activity of an arachidonic acid-selective phospholipase A(2). Although chronic valproic acid produces similar effects on brain arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid turnover, it does not alter phospholipase A(2) activity, suggesting that it targets a different enzyme in the turnover pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS/RESULTS: By isolating rat brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases (Acsl), we show in vitro that valproic acid is a non-competitive inhibitor of Acsl, as it reduces the maximal velocity of the reaction without changing the affinity of the substrate for the enzyme. While valproic acid inhibited the synthesis of arachidonoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, and docosahexaenoyl-CoA, the K (i )for inhibition of arachidonoyl-CoA synthesis (14.1 mM) was approximately one fifth the K (i) for inhibiting palmitoyl-CoA (85.4 mM) and docosahexaenoyl-CoA (78.2 mM) synthesis. As chronic administration of valproic acid in bipolar disorder achieves whole-brain levels of 1.0 to 1.5 mM, inhibition of arachidonoyl-CoA formation can occur at brain concentrations that are therapeutically relevant to this disease. Furthermore, brain microsomal Acsl did not produce valproyl-CoA. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that valproic acid acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of brain microsomal Acsl, and that inhibition is substrate-selective. The study supports the hypothesis that valproic acid acts in bipolar disorder by reducing the brain arachidonic acid cascade, by inhibiting arachidonoyl-CoA formation.

23532634|t|Adrenocortical reserves in hyperthyroidism.
23532634|a|Explicit data regarding the changes in adrenocortical reserves during hyperthyroidism do not exist. We aimed to document the capability (response) of adrenal gland to secrete cortisol and DHEA-S during hyperthyroidism compared to euthyroidism, and to describe factors associated with these responses. A standard-dose (0.25 mg/i.v.) ACTH stimulation test was performed to the same patients before hyperthyroidism treatment, and after attainment of euthyroidism. Baseline cortisol (Cor0), DHEA-S (DHEA-S0), cortisol binding globulin (CBG), ACTH, calculated free cortisol (by Coolen's equation = CFC), free cortisol index (FCI), 60-min cortisol (Cor60), and DHEA-S (DHEA-S60), delta cortisol (DCor), delta DHEA-S (DDHEA-S) responses were evaluated. Forty-one patients [22 females, 49.5 + 15.2 years old, 32 Graves disease, nine toxic nodular goiter] had similar Cor0, DHEA-S0, CFC, FCI, and DHEA-S60 in hyperthyroid and euthyroid states. Cor60, DCor, and DDHEA-S were lower in hyperthyroidism. In four (10 %) patients the peak ACTH-stimulated cortisol values were lower than 18 ug/dL. When the test repeated after attainment of euthyroidism, all of the patients had normal cortisol response. Regression analysis demonstrated an independent association of Cor60 with free T3 in hyperthyroidism. However, the predictors of CFC, FCI, and DHEA-S levels were serum creatinine levels in hyperthyroidism, and both creatinine and transaminase levels in euthyroidism. ACTH-stimulated peak cortisol, delta cortisol, and delta DHEA-S levels are decreased during hyperthyroidism, probably due to increased turnover. Since about 10 % of the subjects with hyperthyroidism are at risk for adrenal insufficiency, clinicians dealing with Graves' disease should be alert to the possibility of adrenal insufficiency during hyperthyroid stage.

11292635|t|Contribution of the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter NKCC1 to Cl- secretion in rat OMCD.
11292635|a|In rat kidney the "secretory" isoform of the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) localizes to the basolateral membrane of the alpha-intercalated cell. The purpose of this study was to determine whether rat outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) secretes Cl- and whether transepithelial Cl- transport occurs, in part, through Cl- uptake across the basolateral membrane mediated by NKCC1 in series with Cl- efflux across the apical membrane. OMCD tubules from rats treated with deoxycorticosterone pivalate were perfused in vitro in symmetrical HCO/CO2-buffered solutions. Cl- secretion was observed in this segment, accompanied by a lumen positive transepithelial potential. Bumetanide (100 microM), when added to the bath, reduced Cl- secretion by 78%, although the lumen positive transepithelial potential and fluid flux were unchanged. Bumetanide-sensitive Cl- secretion was dependent on extracellular Na+ and either K+ or NH, consistent with the ion dependency of NKCC1-mediated Cl- transport. In conclusion, OMCD tubules from deoxycorticosterone pivalate-treated rats secrete Cl- into the luminal fluid through NKCC1-mediated Cl- uptake across the basolateral membrane in series with Cl- efflux across the apical membrane. The physiological role of NKCC1-mediated Cl- uptake remains to be determined. However, the role of NKCC1 in the process of fluid secretion could not be demonstrated.

1543672|t|Terbinafine: mode of action and properties of the squalene epoxidase inhibition.
1543672|a|Terbinafine (Lamisil) has primarily fungicidal action against many fungi as a result of its specific mechanism of squalene epoxidase inhibition. Treated fungi accumulate squalene while becoming deficient in ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. The cidal action is closely associated with the development of high intracellular squalene concentrations, which are believed to interfere with fungal membrane function and cell wall synthesis. In the case of Candida albicans, growth inhibition with terbinafine appears to result from the ergosterol deficiency. The filamentous form of this fungus is more susceptible than the yeast form. Measurement of ergosterol biosynthesis by incorporation of radiolabelled precursors indicates a correlation between inhibition of growth and ergosterol biosynthesis in a range of pathogenic fungi. Terbinafine is a potent non-competitive inhibitor of squalene epoxidase from Candida (Ki = 30 nM). In contrast, inhibition of rat liver squalene epoxidase only occurs at higher drug concentrations (Ki = 77 microM), and is competitive with squalene. Thus, terbinafine has no effect on cholesterol biosynthesis in vivo. Squalene epoxidase is not an enzyme of the cytochrome P-450 type, thereby avoiding potential inhibition of this class of enzymes.

23335025|t|Chemopreventive effects of Ginkgo biloba extract in estrogen-negative human breast cancer cells.
23335025|a|Excessive level of estrogen is considered as a main cause of breast cancer, therefore, many studies have focused on estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, even though ER-negative cancer has a poor prognosis than ER-positive breast cancer. We evaluated the anti-cancer effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) in estrogen-independent breast cancer. GBE has been traditionally used as a platelet activating factor, a circulatory stimulant, a tonic, and anti-asthmatic drug, and anti-cancer agent. However, anti-cancer effects of GBE on ER-negative breast cancer have not been proved yet. In this study, we tested chemotherapeutic potential of GBE in the MDA-MB-231 (ER-negative) human breast cancer cell line. Our results showed that cytotoxicity effects of GBE in MDA-MB-231 lead to DNA fragmentation at high concentrations (500 and 1,000 ug/ml). Caspase-3 was significantly activated and mRNA levels of apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2 and Bax) were altered. These results indicate that GBE induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. It is presumed that GBE has chemopreventive effects in ER-independent breast cancer through anti-proliferation and apoptosis-inducing activities.

23541670|a|We report the discovery of a novel series of ATP-competitive Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) inhibitors based on the 5H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrazine scaffold. The initial leads in this series, compounds 1a and 1h, showed promising potencies, but a lack of selectivity against other isoforms in the JAK family. Computational and crystallographic analysis suggested that the phenyl ether moiety possessed a favorable vector to achieve selectivity. Exploration of this vector resulted in the identification of 12b and 12d, as potent JAK3 inhibitors, demonstrating improved JAK family and kinase selectivity.

15908512|t|Beta1 adrenergic receptor-mediated enhancement of hippocampal CA3 network activity.
15908512|a|Norepinephrine is an endogenous neurotransmitter distributed throughout the mammalian brain. In higher cortical structures such as the hippocampus, norepinephrine, via beta adrenergic receptor (AR) activation, has been shown to reinforce the cognitive processes of attention and memory. In this study, we investigated the effect of beta1AR activation on hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) network activity. AR expression was first determined using immunocytochemistry with antibodies against beta1ARs, which were found to be exceptionally dense in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. CA3 network activity was then examined in vitro using field potential recordings in rat brain slices. The selective betaAR agonist isoproterenol caused an enhancement of hippocampal CA3 network activity, as measured by an increase in frequency of spontaneous burst discharges recorded in the CA3 region. In the presence of alphaAR blockade, concentration-response curves for isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine suggested that a beta1AR was involved in this response, and the rank order of potency was isoproterenol > norepinephrine = epinephrine. Finally, equilibrium dissociation constants (pK(b)) of subtype-selective betaAR antagonists were functionally determined to characterize the AR subtype modulating hippocampal CA3 activity. The selective beta1AR antagonists atenolol and metoprolol blocked isoproterenol-induced enhancement, with apparent K(b) values of 85 +/- 36 and 3.9 +/- 1.7 nM, respectively. In contrast, the selective beta2AR antagonists ICI-118,551 and butoxamine inhibited isoproterenol-mediated enhancement with apparent low affinities (K(b) of 222 +/- 61 and 9268 +/- 512 nM, respectively). Together, this pharmacological profile of subtype-selective betaAR antagonists indicates that in this model, beta1AR activation is responsible for the enhanced hippocampal CA3 network activity initiated by isoproterenol.

14751502|t|Effects of the EGFR/HER2 kinase inhibitor GW572016 on EGFR- and HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell line proliferation, radiosensitization, and resistance.
14751502|a|PURPOSE: Two members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, EGFR and HER2, have been implicated in radioresistance in breast cancer and other malignancies. To gauge the potential clinical utility of targeting both EGFR and HER2 to control growth and radiosensitize human breast cancers, we examined the effect of a dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, GW572016, on the proliferation and radiation response of either EGFR- or HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cell lines. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Primary human breast cancer cell lines that endogenously overexpress EGFR or HER2 and luminal mammary epithelial H16N2 cells stably transfected with HER2 were evaluated for the effect of GW572016 on inhibition of ligand-induced or constitutive receptor phosphorylation, proliferation, radiosensitization, and inhibition of downstream signaling. RESULTS: GW572016 inhibited constitutive and/or ligand-induced EGFR or HER2 tyrosine phosphorylation of all five cell lines, which correlated with the antiproliferative response in all but one cell line. GW572016 radiosensitized EGFR-overexpressing cell lines, but HER2-overexpressing cells were unable to form colonies after brief exposure to GW572016 even in the absence of radiation, and thus could not be evaluated for radiosensitization. One cell line was resistant to the antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects of GW572016, despite receptor inhibition. Exploration of potential mechanisms of resistance in SUM185 cells revealed failure of GW572016 to inhibit downstream ERK and Akt activation, despite inhibition of HER2 phosphorylation. In contrast, sensitive HER2-overexpressing cell lines demonstrated inhibition of both ERK and Akt phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: GW572016 potently inhibits receptor phosphorylation in either EGFR- or HER2-overexpressing cell lines and has both antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects. Resistance to GW572016 was not due to a lack of receptor inhibition, but rather with a lack of inhibition of ERK and Akt, suggesting that measurement of inhibition of crucial signaling pathways may better predict response than inhibition of receptor phosphorylation. The SUM185 cell line provides a valuable model for studying mechanisms of resistance of EGFR/HER2 inhibitor therapy.

12727196|t|Properties of purified recombinant human polyamine oxidase, PAOh1/SMO.
12727196|a|The discovery of an inducible oxidase whose apparent substrate preference is spermine indicates that polyamine catabolism is more complex than that originally proposed. To facilitate the study of this enzyme, the purification and characterization of the recombinant human PAOh1/SMO polyamine oxidase are reported. Purified PAOh1/SMO oxidizes both spermine (K(m)=1.6 microM) and N(1)-acetylspermine (K(m)=51 microM), but does not oxidize spermidine. The purified human enzyme also does not oxidize eight representative antitumor polyamine analogues; however, specific oligamine analogues were found to be potent inhibitors of the oxidation of spermine by PAOh1/SMO. The results of these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that PAOh1/SMO represents a new addition to the polyamine metabolic pathway that may represent a new target for antineoplastic drug development.

3994963|t|Drug-protein interactions: isolation and characterization of covalent adducts of phenoxybenzamine and calmodulin.
3994963|a|Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist containing a (chloroethyl)amine group, labels calmodulin in the presence of calcium. The covalent interaction is inhibited by chlorpromazine in a concentration-dependent manner. Adducts of calmodulin and phenoxybenzamine were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography into four major fractions: two containing 0.6 and 1.2 mol of drug per mol of protein and two different fractions each containing 2.0 mol/mol. Each adduct had a reduced ability to activate cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and myosin light chain kinase, and the chlorpromazine binding capacities of the phenoxybenzamine-calmodulin adducts were diminished to the extent of phenoxybenzamine incorporation into each adduct. Isolation and characterization of labeled peptides from phenoxybenzamine-modified calmodulins indicated that peptides encompassing residues 38-75, 107-126, and 127-148 contained phenoxybenzamine label. These studies directly demonstrate the relatedness between the binding activities of two structurally dissimilar calmodulin antagonists, demonstrate that covalent adducts of calmodulin and drugs with equal stoichiometries of labeling can have quantitative differences in activity and sites of modification, and provide direct evidence of distinct drug binding regions in calmodulin located in the amphipathic alpha-helical regions of the second and fourth domains.

15840827|t|Conversion of 5-aminolevulinate synthase into a more active enzyme by linking the two subunits: spectroscopic and kinetic properties.
15840827|a|The two active sites of dimeric 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, are located on the subunit interface with contribution of essential amino acids from each subunit. Linking the two subunits into a single polypeptide chain dimer (2XALAS) yielded an enzyme with an approximate sevenfold greater turnover number than that of wild-type ALAS. Spectroscopic and kinetic properties of 2XALAS were investigated to explore the differences in the coenzyme structure and kinetic mechanism relative to those of wild-type ALAS that confer a more active enzyme. The absorption spectra of both ALAS and 2XALAS had maxima at 410 and 330 nm, with a greater A(410)/A(330) ratio at pH approximately 7.5 for 2XALAS. The 330 nm absorption band showed an intense fluorescence at 385 nm but not at 510 nm, indicating that the 330 nm absorption species is the substituted aldamine rather than the enolimine form of the Schiff base. The 385 nm emission intensity increased with increasing pH with a single pK of approximately 8.5 for both enzymes, and thus the 410 and 330 nm absorption species were attributed to the ketoenamine and substituted aldamine, respectively. Transient kinetic analysis of the formation and decay of the quinonoid intermediate EQ(2) indicated that, although their rates were similar in ALAS and 2XALAS, accumulation of this intermediate was greater in the 2XALAS-catalyzed reaction. Collectively, these results suggest that ketoenamine is the active form of the coenzyme and forms a more prominent coenzyme structure in 2XALAS than in ALAS at pH approximately 7.5.

23344961|t|Topoisomerase IIb deficiency enhances camptothecin-induced apoptosis.
23344961|a|Camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase (Top) I-targeting drug that stabilizes Top1-DNA covalent adducts, can induce S-phase-specific cytotoxicity due to the arrest of progressing replication forks. However, CPT-induced non-S-phase cytotoxicity is less well characterized. In this study, we have identified topoisomerase IIb (Top2b) as a specific determinant for CPT sensitivity, but not for many other cytotoxic agents, in non-S-phase cells. First, quiescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Top2b were shown to be hypersensitive to CPT with prominent induction of apoptosis. Second, ICRF-187, a Top2 catalytic inhibitor known to deplete Top2b, specifically sensitized MEFs to CPT. To explore the molecular basis for CPT hypersensitivity in Top2b-deficient cells, we found that upon CPT exposure, the RNA polymerase II large subunit (RNAP LS) became progressively depleted, followed by recovery to nearly the original level in wild-type MEFs, whereas RNAP LS remained depleted without recovery in Top2b-deficient cells. Concomitant with the reduction of the RNAP LS level, the p53 protein level was greatly induced. Interestingly, RNAP LS depletion has been well documented to lead to p53-dependent apoptosis. Altogether, our findings support a model in which Top2b deficiency promotes CPT-induced apoptosis in quiescent non-S-phase cells, possibly due to RNAP LS depletion and p53 accumulation.

16789740|t|Discovery and optimization of anthranilic acid sulfonamides as inhibitors of methionine aminopeptidase-2: a structural basis for the reduction of albumin binding.
16789740|a|Methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP2) is a novel target for cancer therapy. As part of an effort to discover orally active reversible inhibitors of MetAP2, a series of anthranilic acid sulfonamides with micromolar affinities for human MetAP2 were identified using affinity selection by mass spectrometry (ASMS) screening. These micromolar hits were rapidly improved to nanomolar leads on the basis of insights from protein crystallography; however, the compounds displayed extensive binding to human serum albumin and had limited activity in cellular assays. Modifications based on structural information on the binding of lead compounds to both MetAP2 and domain III of albumin allowed the identification of compounds with significant improvements in both parameters, which showed good cellular activity in both proliferation and methionine processing assays.

20091113|t|Polymorphisms in dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) are associated with stimulant effects of D-amphetamine: an exploratory pharmacogenetic study using healthy volunteers.
20091113|a|Individuals vary in their subjective responses to stimulant drugs, and these differences are believed to be partially genetic in origin. We evaluated associations between mood, cognitive and cardiovascular responses to d-amphetamine and four polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3): rs460000, rs3756450, rs37022 and rs6869645. Healthy Caucasian male and female volunteers (N = 152) participated in a double-blind, crossover design study in which they received placebo, 10 and 20 mg of d-amphetamine. We measured self-reported rating of mood, performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Task, blood pressure and heart rate. Individuals with the C/C genotype at rs460000 (N = 83) reported approximately twofold higher ratings of stimulation and euphoria relative to the A/A+A/C (N = 69) genotype group, at both the 10 and 20 mg doses. No other responses or SNPs showed significant effects. rs460000 is in perfect LD with rs463379 (CEU: D' = 1; r (2) = 1), which was not studied here, but has been associated with etiology of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These findings suggest a pleiotropic effect of this polymorphic locus on both ADHD and sensitivity to the subjective effects of amphetamine.

12373423|t|Re-evaluation of lisuride pharmacology: 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor-mediated behavioral effects overlap its other properties in rats.
12373423|a|RATIONALE: There is substantial evidence that lisuride can produce effects linked to 5-HT(1A) receptor occupancy. Nevertheless, this action has generally been ignored in the mechanism of action of lisuride, in favor of an exclusive role for dopamine receptors in considering its antiparkinsonian effects, or an exclusive role of 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor activation in hallucinogenesis. These conclusions are surprising when one considers that the potent interaction of lisuride with 5-HT(1A) receptors has been demonstrated in several different laboratories and that activation of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptors can modulate dopaminergically mediated responses. OBJECTIVE: The lack of full substitution of lisuride for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in drug discrimination experiments and induction of a pronounced 5-HT syndrome by this compound at relatively low doses convinced us to execute two series of experiments that might explain the primary mechanism responsible for lisuride-mediated biological effects and its paradoxical classification as a dopamine agonist in the literature. RESULTS: In drug discrimination studies, lisuride fully mimicked the 5-HT(1A) agonist LY 293284, only partially substituted for LSD and DOI, and failed to substitute for (+)-amphetamine. Lisuride produced a significant dose-related increase in flat body posture, forepaw treading, and lower-lip retraction which reflect a modulation of behavior by action at central 5-HT(1A) receptors. Only pMPPI [4-iodo-N-[2-[4-(methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridynyl-benzamide hydrochloride], a selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist, was effective in inhibiting all 5-HT syndrome behaviors produced by lisuride, whereas pMPPI was without effect on any behavior induced by LSD. Lisuride dose dependently decreased body temperature in rats with a potency similar to that of the selective 5-HT(1A) agonist LY 293284. The hypothermic effect of lisuride was prevented by pre-injection of pMPPI, but not by ketanserin or haloperidol. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of low doses of lisuride are clearly mediated by stimulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors.

17161452|t|Warfarin dose and the pharmacogenomics of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 - rationale and perspectives.
17161452|a|Warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant, but there is greater than 10-fold interindividual variability in the dose required to attain a therapeutic response. Information from pharmacogenomics, the study of the interaction of an individual's genotype and drug response, can help optimize drug efficacy while minimizing adverse drug reactions. Pharmacogenetic analysis of two genes, the warfarin metabolic enzyme CYP2C9 and warfarin target enzyme, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 VKORC1, confirmed their influence on warfarin maintenance dose. Possession of CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 variant alleles, which result in decreased enzyme activity, is associated with a significant decrease in the mean warfarin dose. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VKORC1 are associated with warfarin dose across the normal dose range. Haplotypes based on these SNPs explain a large fraction of the interindividual variation in warfarin dose, and VKORC1 has an approximately three-fold greater effect than CYP2C9. Algorithms incorporating genetic (CYP2C9 and VKORC1), demographic, and clinical factors to estimate the warfarin dosage, could potentially minimize the risk of over dose during warfarin induction.

23578607|t|Glutathione conjugation attenuates biological activities of 6-dehydroshogaol from ginger.
23578607|a|6-Dehydroshogaol (6-DHSG) is a bioactive a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compound isolated from fresh ginger with anti-inflammatory and phase II enzyme inducing activities. Here we describe the glutathione (GSH)-dependent metabolism and the effect of this metabolic transformation on the biological activities of 6-DHSG. Compared with other ginger compounds, such as 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol, 6-DHSG showed the most potent anti-inflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The biological activities of 6-DHSG were attenuated by sulfhydryl antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH) or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), but not ascorbic acid (ASC). 6-DHSG was metabolised by GSH to form a GSH conjugate (GS-6-DHSG) in RAW 264.7 cells, via a potential mechanism involving the catalytic activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). GS-6-DHSG showed reduced biological activities compared with 6-DHSG in multiple biological assays. Together, these results indicate that GSH conjugation attenuates the biological activities of 6-DHSG and other a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.

23318471|t|Peroxynitrite mediates testosterone-induced vasodilation of microvascular resistance vessels.
23318471|a|Our knowledge of how androgens influence the cardiovascular system is far from complete, and this lack of understanding is especially true of how androgens affect resistance vessels. Our aim was to identify the signaling mechanisms stimulated by testosterone (TES) in microvascular arteries and to understand how these mechanisms mediate TES-induced vasodilation. Mesenteric microvessels were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Tension studies demonstrated a rapid, concentration-dependent, vasodilatory response to TES that did not involve protein synthesis or aromatization to 17b-estradiol. Dichlorofluorescein fluorescence and nitrotyrosine immunoblot experiments indicated that TES stimulated peroxynitrite formation in microvessels, and functional studies demonstrated that TES-induced vasodilation was inhibited by scavenging peroxynitrite. As predicted, TES enhanced the production of both peroxynitrite precursors (i.e., superoxide and nitic oxide), and xanthine oxidase was identified as the likely source of TES-stimulated superoxide production. Functional and biochemical studies indicated that TES signaling involved activity of the phosphoinositide 3 (PI3) kinase-protein kinase B (Akt) cascade initiated by activation of the androgen receptor and culminated in enhanced production of cGMP and microvascular vasodilation. These findings, derived from a variety of analytical and functional approaches, provide evidence for a novel nongenomic signaling mechanism for androgen action in the microvasculature: TES-stimulated vasodilation mediated primarily by peroxynitrite formed from xanthine oxidase-generated superoxide and NO. This response was associated with activation of the PI3 kinase-Akt signaling cascade initiated by activation of the androgen receptor. We propose this mechanism could account for TES-stimulated cGMP production in microvessels and, ultimately, vasodilation.

23307185|t|Protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 and PAR4 differentially regulate factor V expression from human platelets.
23307185|a|With the recent interest of protease-activated receptors (PAR) 1 and PAR4 as possible targets for the treatment of thrombotic disorders, we compared the efficacy of protease-activated receptor (PAR)1 and PAR4 in the generation of procoagulant phenotypes on platelet membranes. PAR4-activating peptide (AP)-stimulated platelets promoted thrombin generation in plasma up to 5 minutes earlier than PAR1-AP-stimulated platelets. PAR4-AP-mediated factor V (FV) association with the platelet surface was 1.6-fold greater than for PAR1-AP. Moreover, PAR4 stimulation resulted in a 3-fold greater release of microparticles, compared with PAR1 stimulation. More robust FV secretion and microparticle generation with PAR4-AP was attributable to stronger and more sustained phosphorylation of myosin light chain at serine 19 and threonine 18. Inhibition of Rho-kinase reduced PAR4-AP-mediated FV secretion and microparticle generation to PAR1-AP-mediated levels. Thrombin generation assays measuring prothrombinase complex activity demonstrated 1.5-fold higher peak thrombin levels on PAR4-AP-stimulated platelets, compared with PAR1-AP-stimulated platelets. Rho-kinase inhibition reduced PAR4-AP-mediated peak thrombin generation by 25% but had no significant effect on PAR1-AP-mediated thrombin generation. In conclusion, stimulation of PAR4 on platelets leads to faster and more robust thrombin generation, compared with PAR1 stimulation. The greater procoagulant potential is related to more efficient FV release from intracellular stores and microparticle production driven by stronger and more sustained myosin light chain phosphorylation. These data have implications about the role of PAR4 during hemostasis and are clinically relevant in light of recent efforts to develop PAR antagonists to treat thrombotic disorders.

12373557|t|Stereospecific inhibition of monoamine uptake transporters by meta-hydroxyephedrine isomers.
12373557|a|Meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED) comprises four stereoisomers consisting of two enantiomeric pairs related to ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. HED is transported into adrenergic neurons and radiolabeled HED has been employed in positron emission tomography (PET) to image adrenergic neurons in vivo. To extend structure-activity analyses of binding sites within monoamine transporters and to determine which stereoisomer displayed the best selectivity for PET imaging applications, we tested the HED compounds for their abilities to inhibit [(3)H]neurotransmitter uptake into platelets, transfected cells, and chromaffin vesicles. We hypothesized that the HED compounds would be most potent at the norepinephrine transporter (NET) compared to the serotonin or dopamine transporters and that the 1R diastereomers would be more effective than 1S diastereomers. Supporting the hypotheses, all stereoisomers were most potent at the NET and the 1R,2S stereoisomer was the most potent inhibitor overall. However, the 1S,2R isomer may be preferred for PET applications because of better selectivity among the transporters and reduced neuronal recycling.

15955565|t|The platelet P2 receptors as molecular targets for old and new antiplatelet drugs.
15955565|a|Platelet activation by ADP and ATP plays a crucial role in haemostasis and thrombosis, and their so-called P2 receptors are potential targets for antithrombotic drugs. The ATP-gated channel P2X1 and the 2 G protein-coupled P2Y1 and P2Y12 ADP receptors selectively contribute to platelet aggregation. The P2Y1 receptor is responsible for ADP-induced shape change and weak and transient aggregation, while the P2Y12 receptor is responsible for the completion and amplification of the response to ADP and to all platelet agonists, including thromboxane A2 (TXA2), thrombin, and collagen. The P2X1 receptor is involved in platelet shape change and in activation by collagen under shear conditions. Due to its central role in the formation and stabilization of a thrombus, the P2Y12 receptor is a well-established target of antithrombotic drugs like ticlopidine or clopidogrel, which have proved efficacy in many clinical trials and experimental models of thrombosis. Competitive P2Y12 antagonists have also been shown to be effective in experimental thrombosis as well as in several clinical trials. Studies in P2Y1 and P2X1 knockout mice and experimental thrombosis models using selective P2Y1 and P2X1 antagonists have shown that, depending on the conditions, these receptors could also be potential targets for new antithrombotic drugs.

17159811|t|Effect of galantamine on acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities in the presence of L-carnitine in rat selected brain and peripheral tissues.
17159811|a|OBJECTIVES: The alkaloid galantamine (GAL), which exhibits a combined anticholinesterase and direct parasympathomimetic mechanism of action, is employed in conjunction with therapeutic interventions in the stimulation of central cholinergic transfer in cognitive diseases. We attempted to achieve pharmacologically-induced enhancement of the parasympathomimetic activity of GAL in the key areas of rat brain, using an interactive combination of the alkaloid with the transmembrane enhancer L-carnitine (CAR). METHODS: We investigated activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in brain areas (frontal cortex, basal ganglia, septum and hippocampus) and the hypophysis, and that of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in plasma and liver. RESULTS: Following administration of the highest of the GAL doses used (2.5; 5; 10 mg/kg i.m.), AChE activity decreased mainly in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypophysis. In the interaction of GAL and CAR, AChE inhibition was stronger but without any statistical significance. The peripheral inhibition of BuChE was found to be dose-dependent. Premedication by CAR led to a slight change in the values of the activities monitored. CONCLUSIONS: CAR in terms of positive modulation of GAL targeting to the central nervous system had no statistically significant effect.

23530006|t|Universal rule on chirality-dependent bandgaps in graphene antidot lattices.
23530006|a|Graphene with periodically patterned antidots has attracted intense research attention as it represents a facile route to open a bandgap for graphene electronics. However, not all graphene antidot lattices (GALs) can open a bandgap and a guiding rule is missing. Here, through systematic first-principles calculations, it is found that bandgaps in triangular GALs are surprisingly well defined by a chirality vector R = n a1 + ma2 connecting two neighboring antidots, where a1 and a2 are the basis vectors of graphene. The bandgap opens in the GALs with (n-m)mod3 = 0 but remains closed in those with (n-m)mod3 = +1, reminiscent of the gap-chirality rule in carbon nanotubes. Remarkably, the gap value in GALs allows ample modulation by adjusting the length of chirality vectors, shape and size of the antidots. The gap-chirality relation in GALs stems from the chirality-dependent atomic structures of GALs as revealed by a super-atom model as well as Clar sextet analyses. This chirality-dependent bandgap is further shown to be a generic behavior in any parallelogram GAL and thus serves as an essential stepping stone for experimenters to realize graphene devices by antidot engineering.

23535337|t|Disruption of AtWNK8 Enhances Tolerance of Arabidopsis to Salt and Osmotic Stresses via Modulating Proline Content and Activities of Catalase and Peroxidase.
23535337|a|With no lysine kinases (WNKs) play important roles in plant growth and development. However, its role in salt and osmotic stress tolerance is unclear. Here, we report that AtWNK8 is mainly expressed in primary root, hypocotyl, stamen and pistil and is induced by NaCl and sorbitol treatment. Compared to the wild-type, the T-DNA knock-out wnk8 mutant was more tolerant to severe salinity and osmotic stresses, as indicated by 27% and 198% more fresh weight in the NaCl and sorbitol treatment, respectively. The wnk8 mutant also accumulated 1.43-fold more proline than the wild-type in the sorbitol treatment. Under NaCl and sorbitol stresses, catalase (CAT) activity in wnk8 mutant was 1.92- and 3.7-times of that in Col-0, respectively. Similarly, under salt and osmotic stress conditions, peroxidase (POD) activities in wnk8 mutant were 1.81- and 1.58-times of that in Col-0, respectively. Taken together, we revealed that maintaining higher CAT and POD activities might be one of the reasons that the disruption of AtWNK8 enhances the tolerance to salt stress, and accumulating more proline and higher activities of CAT and POD might result in the higher tolerance of WNK8 to osmotic stress.

15180525|t|Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase as a drug target in leukemia.
15180525|a|The hematopoietic class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Flt3 (Flk2, STK1) has recently received much attention as a potential drug target. Activation of Flt3 by different types of mutations plays an important role for proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and prevention of differentiation of leukemic blasts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). At least one type of such mutations - an internal tandem duplication in the Flt3 juxtamembrane domain (Flt3-ITD) - has been associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Signal transduction of Flt3 involves activation of several conserved pathways, including the RAS/MAP-Kinase and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt signaling cascades. Transforming versions of Flt3 exhibit altered signaling, for example a very pronounced activation of STAT5, ultimately resulting in alternate profiles of gene expression and cell transformation. Selective inhibitors of Flt3 tyrosine kinase activity have the potential to suppress aberrant Flt3 signaling. Although highly homologous to other class III RTKs, Flt3 is resistant to the phenylaminopyrimidine STI571 (Gleevec, Imatinib), a potent inhibitor of other RTKs in the family, such as the PDGFbeta-receptor or c-Kit. STI571 binding to Flt3 is prevented by the phenylalanine 691 side-chain in the ATP binding center and mutating this site to threonine renders the corresponding Flt3 mutant sensitive to STI571. Compounds of several other structural families, including the quinoxaline AG1296, the bis(1H-2-indolyl)-1-methanone D-65476, the indolinones SU5416 and SU11248, the indolocarbazoles PKC412 and CEP-701, and the piperazonyl quinazoline CT53518, are potent inhibitors of Flt3 kinase. They exhibit different selectivity profiles, both with respect to other kinases and among wildtype Flt3 and its activated versions. These compounds hold promise as novel drugs against AML and as probes for understanding activation mechanisms and signaling pathways in the class III RTK family.

23511016|t|Synthesis of a DOTA (Gd(3+))-conjugate of proton-pump inhibitor pantoprazole for gastric wall imaging studies.
23511016|a|Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to evaluate gastrointestinal (GI) structure and functions in humans. Despite filling the viscus lumen with a contrast agent, visualization of the viscus wall is limited. To overcome this limitation, we de novo synthesized a conjugate that covalently combines a Gd-based MRI contrast agent, encaged with a chelating agent (DOTA), with pantoprazole, which is a widely used proton pump inhibitor that binds to proton pumps in the stomach and colon. The DOTA linkage was installed at a mechanism-based strategic location in the pantoprazole molecule to minimize a possible negative effect of the structural modification on the drug. It is anticipated that by defining the wall of the stomach and colon, this compound will facilitate functional MRI of the GI tract in humans.

17504182|t|Pharmacological therapy of Cushing's syndrome: drugs and indications.
17504182|a|OBJECTIVE: To review the main pharmacological properties and clinical applications of the drugs used in the medical therapy of Cushing's syndrome. DATA SOURCES: Search for articles were performed in the following dababases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of systematic Reviews and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Search terms included Cushing's syndrome and drug therapy. DATA SYNTHESIS: Available data suggest that neuromodulatory compounds affect corticotropin (ACTH) or ACTH-releasing hormone (CRH) synthesis and release. They include serotonin antagonists, dopaminergic agonists, valproic acid, reserpine, somatostatin analogs and thiazolidinediones. These agents have been effective in a limited number of patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Inhibitors of steroidogenesis reduce cortisol production by blocking one (metyrapone, trilostane) or several (aminoglutethimide, ketoconazole, fluconazole, etomidate) enzymes involved in steroid biosynthesis. Mitotane is a steroidogenesis inhibitor with adrenolitic properties. Mifepriston'e blocks glucocorticoid receptor activation without modifying cortisol synthesis. CONCLUSION: Agents that inhibit steroidogenesis are useful in all forms of Cushing's syndrome and are effective in about 70% of patients. Main indications for drug therapy include preparation for surgery, persistence or recurrence after surgery, while awaiting for the effect of radiation therapy, occult ectopic ACTH syndrome, severe hypercortisolism and malignancy related hypercortisolism.

23154865|t|Enhanced heterodimerization of Bax by Bcl-2 mutants improves irradiated cell survival.
23154865|a|B Cell Lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein suppresses ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis in hemato-lymphoid system. To enhance the survival of irradiated cells, we have compared the effects and mechanism of Bcl-2 and its functional variants, D34A (caspase-3 resistant) and S70E (mimics phosphorylation on S70). Bcl-2 and its mutants were transfected into hematopoietic cell line and assessed for cell survival, clonogenicity and cell cycle perturbations upon exposure to ionizing radiation. The electrostatic potential of BH3 cleft of Bcl-2/mutants and their heterodimerization with Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) were computationally evaluated. Correspondingly, these results were verified by co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting. The mutants afford higher radioprotective effect than Bcl-2 in apoptotic and clonogenic assays at D(0) (radiation dose at which 37 % cell survival was observed). The computational and functional analysis indicates that mutants have higher propensity to neutralize Bax protein by heterodimerization and have increased caspase-9 suppression capability, which is responsible for enhanced survival. This study implies potential of Bcl-2 mutants or their chemical/peptide mimics to elicit radioprotective effect in cells exposed to radiation.

17018843|t|Characterization of the regulation of renal Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 by insulin.
17018843|a|Insulin receptors are widely distributed in the kidney and affect multiple aspects of renal function. In the proximal tubule, insulin regulates volume and acid-base regulation through stimulation of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE3. This paper characterizes the signaling pathway by which insulin stimulates NHE3 in a cell culture model [opossum kidney (OK) cell]. Insulin has two distinct phases of action on NHE3. Chronic insulin (24 h) activates NHE3 through the classic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase 1 (PI3K-SGK1) pathway as insulin stimulates SGK1 phosphorylation and the insulin effect can be blocked by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or a dominant-negative SGK1. We showed that SGK1 transcript and protein are expressed in rat proximal tubule and OK cells. We previously showed that glucocorticoids augment the effect of insulin on NHE3 (Klisic J, Hu MC, Nief V, Reyes L, Fuster D, Moe OW, Ambuhl PM. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 283: F532-F539, 2002). Part of this can be mediated via induction of SGK1 by glucocorticoids, and indeed the insulin effect on NHE3 can also be amplified by overexpression of SGK1. We next addressed the acute effect of insulin (1-2 h) on NHE3 by systematically examining the candidate signaling cascades and activation mechanisms of NHE3. We ruled out the PI3K-SGK1-Akt and TC10 pathways, increased surface NHE3, NHE3 phosphorylation, NHE3 association with calcineurin homologous protein 1 or megalin as mechanisms of acute activation of NHE3 by insulin. In summary, insulin stimulates NHE3 acutely via yet undefined pathways and mechanisms. The chronic effect of insulin is mediated by the classic PI3K-SGK1 route.

16988497|t|Diet and gene expression: delta-5 and delta-6 desaturases in healthy Chinese and European subjects.
16988497|a|AIM: To compare the composition of fatty acids (FAs) in diet, and the expression of delta-6 desaturase (D6D) and delta-5 desaturase (D5D) genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) between Chinese and Europeans. METHODS: Three-day dietary records from 20 subjects from Beijing, China (n = 10) and Kent, UK (n = 10) were analysed. Expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes of the subjects was determined using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The dietary intake of Chinese subjects contained less saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), but more essential fatty acids (EFAs) than that of Europeans. Levels of expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes of Chinese subjects were significantly lower than those of Europeans. A significant positive correlation was found between dietary intake of total SFAs and total MUFAs and expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes, but a significant negative correlation between dietary intake of linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (LNA) and the expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes. CONCLUSION: Intake of high SFAs and MUFAs appears to increase expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes, whilst high EFAs intake appears to decrease expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes. A follow-up study of the expression of D6D and D5D genes in Chinese who live in European countries with high SFA and MUFA diets would be of interest.

19472276|t|Screening of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors by CE after enzymatic reaction at capillary inlet.
19472276|a|In this study the development of a procedure based on capillary electrophoresis after enzymatic reaction at capillary inlet methodology for the screening and in vitro evaluation of the biological activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors is presented. The progress of the enzymatic reaction of the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine at pH 8 in the presence of AChE and the inhibitor studied is determined by measuring at 230 nm the peak area of the reaction product thiocholine (TCh). In the method employed the capillary was first filled with 30 mM borate-phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and subsequently, plugs of: (i) water, (ii) AChE solution, (iii) substrate solution with or without inhibitor, (iv) AChE solution, and (v) water, were hydrodynamically injected into the capillary, and were allowed to stand (and react) during a waiting period of 2 min. The applicability of the proposed methodology to estimate different kinetic parameters of interest such as inhibition constants K(i), identification of inhibitory action mechanism and IC(50), is evaluated using compounds with known activity, tacrine edrophonium, and neostigmine. The results obtained are compared with bibliographic values and confirm the effectiveness of the methodology proposed. Finally a method for AChE Inhibitor screening is proposed.

23500776|t|EROD activity induction in peripheral blood lymphocytes, liver and brain tissues of rats orally exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
23500776|a|Little is known in terms of multi-matrix cytochrome P450 activity induction under repeated oral exposure to planar halogenated and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHH, PAH). In the present study, 60 rats were daily exposed, during 28days, to oral ingestion of a mixture consisting of phenanthrene, pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene at 0, 6 or 600ug/day. EROD activity, reflecting almost exclusively CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 activities, was measured in brain and liver microsomes as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). All induction kinetics could be appropriately fitted using logistic-like models. After 28days of exposure to a 6ug/day dose, EROD activity was found to be 91, 152 and 94-fold increased in lymphocytes, liver and brain, respectively, compared to day 0. Plateau activities could be appropriately fitted versus ingested doses using Hill or Michaelis-Menten models. Correlations between matrices made it possible to conclude that EROD activity in PBL should be considered as a sensitive, convenient and non-destructive approach for (i) evaluating EROD activity in liver, which was found to represent 98% of the observed EROD activities in the three tested matrices and (ii) evaluating oral exposure of homogeneous groups of farm animals (race, diet) to CYP inducing PAH and PHH.

15547682|t|Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 and the genes encoding prostasin, alpha-spectrin, and Nedd4.
15547682|a|Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1), a rare disorder of infancy, presents with potential life-threatening salt wasting and failure to thrive. Thus far, PHA1 has been attributed to mutations affecting the mineralocorticoid receptor or any of the three subunits assembling the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). However, a lot of patients with a phenotype resembling PHA1, show no defects in these proteins, making it likely that further genes are involved in the aetiology of this disease. Recent studies have elucidated additional participants (alpha-spectrin and members of the families of transmembrane serine proteases, ubiquitin-protein ligases, and serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinases, respectively) regulating and/or interacting in the complex pathway of sodium retention in the amiloride-sensitive distal nephron. This led us to investigate whether PHA1 can also be associated with mutations in some of these genes. Our data suggest that at least the prostasin gene might be excluded as a causative locus.

23538162|t|Activating glucocorticoid receptor-ERK signaling pathway contributes to ginsenoside Rg1 protection against b-amyloid peptide-induced human endothelial cells apoptosis.
23538162|a|The deposition of b-amyloid (Ab) in neurons and vascular cells of the brain has been characterized in Alzheimer's disease. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) is an active components in Panax ginseng, a famous traditional Chinese medicines recorded in Compendium of Materia Medica. Present study attempted to evaluate the potential mechanisms of Ab-mediated insult and the protective effects of Rg1 on human endothelial cells. Rg1 attenuated the Ab25-35-associated mitochondrial apoptotic events, accompanied by inhibiting HIF-1a expression followed by intracellular reactive nitrogen species generation, and protein nitrotyrosination. These protective effects were abolished by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU486 or p-ERK inhibitor U0126 rather than estrogen receptor a antagonist ICI 82,780. Taken together, our results suggested that Rg1 protected against Ab25-35-induced apoptosis at least in part by two complementary GR-dependent ERK phosphorylation pathways: (1) down-regulating HIF-1a initiated protein nitrotyrosination, and (2) inhibiting mitochondrial apoptotic cascades. These data provided a novel insight to the mechanisms of Rg1protective effects on Ab25-35-induced endothelial cells apoptosis, suggesting that GR-ERK signaling pathway might play an important role in it.

23485065|t|Conformation Guides Molecular Efficacy in Docking Screens of Activated b-2 Adrenergic G Protein Coupled Receptor.
23485065|a|A prospective, large library virtual screen against an activated b2-adrenergic receptor (b2AR) structure returned potent agonists to the exclusion of inverse-agonists, providing the first complement to the previous virtual screening campaigns against inverse-agonist-bound G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) structures, which predicted only inverse-agonists. In addition, two hits recapitulated the signaling profile of the co-crystal ligand with respect to the G protein and arrestin mediated signaling. This functional fidelity has important implications in drug design, as the ability to predict ligands with predefined signaling properties is highly desirable. However, the agonist-bound state provides an uncertain template for modeling the activated conformation of other GPCRs, as a dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) activated model templated on the activated b2AR structure returned few hits of only marginal potency.

23330546|t|Nuclear receptors in bile acid metabolism.
23330546|a|Bile acids are signaling molecules that activate nuclear receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, and vitamin D receptor, and play a critical role in the regulation of lipid, glucose, energy, and drug metabolism. These xenobiotic/endobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors regulate phase I oxidation, phase II conjugation, and phase III transport in bile acid and drug metabolism in the digestive system. Integration of bile acid metabolism with drug metabolism controls absorption, transport, and metabolism of nutrients and drugs to maintain metabolic homeostasis and also protects against liver injury, inflammation, and related metabolic diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, and obesity. Bile-acid-based drugs targeting nuclear receptors are in clinical trials for treating cholestatic liver diseases and fatty liver disease.

23143891|t|Metabolic pathways of inhaled glucocorticoids by the CYP3A enzymes.
23143891|a|Asthma is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world, for which the mainstay treatment has been inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs). Despite the widespread use of these drugs, approximately 30% of asthma sufferers exhibit some degree of steroid insensitivity or are refractory to inhaled GCs. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is interpatient variability in the clearance of these compounds. The objective of this research is to determine how metabolism of GCs by the CYP3A family of enzymes could affect their effectiveness in asthmatic patients. In this work, the metabolism of four frequently prescribed inhaled GCs, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate, by the CYP3A family of enzymes was studied to identify differences in their rates of clearance and to identify their metabolites. Both interenzyme and interdrug variability in rates of metabolism and metabolic fate were observed. CYP3A4 was the most efficient metabolic catalyst for all the compounds, and CYP3A7 had the slowest rates. CYP3A5, which is particularly relevant to GC metabolism in the lungs, was also shown to efficiently metabolize triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate. In contrast, flunisolide was only metabolized via CYP3A4, with no significant turnover by CYP3A5 or CYP3A7. Common metabolites included 6b-hydroxylation and D(6)-dehydrogenation for triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and flunisolide. The structure of D(6)-flunisolide was unambiguously established by NMR analysis. Metabolism also occurred on the D-ring substituents, including the 21-carboxy metabolites for triamcinolone acetonide and flunisolide. The novel metabolite 21-nortriamcinolone acetonide was also identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR analysis.

10796631|t|Long acting beta-agonists versus theophylline for maintenance treatment of asthma.
10796631|a|BACKGROUND: Theophylline and long acting beta2-agonists are bronchodilators used for the management of persistent asthma symptoms, especially nocturnal asthma. They represent different classes of drug with differing side-effect profiles. OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative efficacy, safety and side-effects of long-acting beta-agonists and theophylline in the maintenance treatment of asthma. SEARCH STRATEGY: Randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group register. The register was searched using the following terms: asthma and theophylline and long acting beta-agonist or formoterol or foradile or eformoterol or salmeterol or bambuterol or bitolterol. Titles and abstracts were then screened to identify potentially relevant studies. The bibliography of each RCT was searched for additional RCTs. Authors of identified RCTs were contacted for other relevant published and unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: All included studies were RCTs involving adults and children with clinical evidence of asthma. These studies must have compared oral sustained release and/or dose adjusted theophylline with an inhaled long-acting beta-agonist. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Potentially relevant trials, identified by screening titles and/or abstracts, were obtained. Two reviewers independently assessed full text versions of these trials to decided whether the trial should be included in the review, and assessed its methodological quality. Where there was disagreement between reviewers, this was resolved by consensus, or reference to a third party. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by simple agreement. Study authors were contacted to clarify randomisation methods, provide missing data, verify the data extracted and identify unpublished studies. Relevant pharmaceutical manufacturers were also contacted. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials met the inclusion criteria. Five used salmeterol and one, biltoterol. They were of varying quality. There was a trend for salmeterol to improve FEV1 more than theophylline in three studies and salmeterol use was associated with more symptom free nights. Bitolterol, used in only one study, was reported to be less effective than theophylline. Subjects taking salmeterol experienced fewer adverse events than those using theophylline (Relative Risk 0.38; 95%Confidence Intervals 0.25, 0.57). Significant reductions were reported for central nervous system adverse events (Relative Risk 0.51; 95%Confidence Intervals 0.30, 0.88) and gastrointestinal adverse events (Relative Risk 0.32; 95%Confidence Intervals 0.17, 0.59). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Salmeterol may be more effective than theophylline in reducing asthma symptoms including night waking and improving lung function. More adverse events occurred in subjects using theophylline when compared to salmeterol.

23305850|t|Identification of aldo-keto reductases as NRF2-target marker genes in human cells.
23305850|a|Transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) plays a crucial role in the cellular defense against oxidative/electrophilic stress by up-regulating multiple antioxidant genes. Numerous studies with genetically modified animals have demonstrated that Nrf2 is a sensitivity determining factor upon the exposure to environmental chemicals including carcinogens. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that polymorphism in the human NRF2 promoter is associated with higher risks for developing acute lung injury, gastric mucosal inflammation, and nephritis. Therefore, the identification of reliable and effective human target genes of NRF2 may allow the monitoring of NRF2 activity and to predict individual sensitivity to environmental stress-induced damage. For this purpose, we investigated genes that are tightly controlled by NRF2 to establish markers for NRF2 activity in human cells. Firstly, in the normal human renal epithelial HK-2 cells, the measurement of the expression of 30 previously reported NRF2 target genes in response to NRF2 inducers (sulforaphane, tert-butylhydroquinone, cinnamic aldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide) showed that the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C1 is highly inducible by all treatments. Accordantly, the basal and inducible expressions of AKRs were significantly attenuated in NRF2-silenced HK-2 cells. Whereas, cells with stable KEAP1 knockdown, which causes a modest NRF2 activation, demonstrated substantially increased levels of AKR1A1, 1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Secondly, the linkage between NRF2 and the AKRs was confirmed in human monocytic leukemia cell line U937, which can be a model of peripherally available blood cells. The treatment of U937 cells with NRF2 inducers including sulforaphane effectively elevated the expression of AKR1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Whereas, the levels of both the basal and sulforaphane-inducible expression of AKR1C1 were significantly reduced in NRF2-silenced stable U937 cells compared to the control cells. Similarly, the inducible expression of AKR1C1 was observed in another human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 as well as in human primary blood CD14(+) monocytes. In conclusion, together with the high inducibility and NRF2 dependency shown in renal epithelial cells as well as in peripherally available blood cells, current findings suggest that AKRs can be utilized as a marker of NRF2 activity in human cells.

22705396|t|The potential of nicotinic enhancement of cognitive remediation training in schizophrenia.
22705396|a|Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are critically important predictors of long-term psychosocial outcome and are not significantly ameliorated by currently available medications. Cognitive remediation training has shown promise for alleviating cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, but the clinical significance has often been limited by small effect sizes. Approaches that achieve larger improvement involve time requirements that can be cost-prohibitive within the current clinical care system. This mini-review evaluates the theoretical potential of a pharmacological enhancement strategy of cognitive remediation training with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists. nAChR agonists can facilitate sensory processing, alertness, attention, learning and memory. While these effects may be too subtle and short-lasting to be of clinical relevance as a primary treatment of cognitive deficits, they constitute an ideal effects profile for enhancing training benefits. Several mechanisms are described through which repeated coupling of cognitive training challenges with nAChR stimulation may enhance and accelerate cognitive remediation training effects, advancing such interventions into more effective and practicable treatments of some of the most debilitating symptoms of schizophrenia. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.

23259985|t|Bioreducible polymers as a determining factor for polyplex decomplexation rate and transfection.
23259985|a|Polyplex formation (complexation) and gene release from the polyplexes (decomplexation) are major events in polymeric gene delivery; however, the effect of the decomplexation rate on transfection has been rarely investigated. This study employed mixed polymers of poly((L)-lysine) (PLL: MW ~7.4 kDa) and reducible PLL (RPLL) (MW ~6.7 kDa) to design decomplexation rate-controllable PLL(100-x)RPLL(x)/pDNA complexes (PRL(x) polyplexes). The transfection efficiency of a model gene (luciferase) in MCF7 and HEK293 cell lines increased with increasing x (RPLL content) in the PRL(x) polyplexes until peaking at x = 2.5 and 10, respectively, after which point transfection efficiency declined rapidly. In MCF7 cells, PRL(2.5) polyplex produced 3 or 223 times higher gene expression than PLL or RPLL polyplexes, respectively. Similarly, the transfection efficiency of PRL(10) polyplex-transfected HEK293 cells was 3.8 or 67 times higher than that of PLL or RPLL polyplexes, respectively. The transfection results were not apparently related to the particle size, surface charge, complexation/compactness, cellular uptake, or cytotoxicity of the tested polyplexes. However, the decomplexation rate varied by RPLL content in the polyplexes, which in turn influenced the gene transfection. The nuclear localization of pDNA delivered by PRL(x) polyplexes showed a similar trend to their transfection efficiencies. This study suggests that an optimum decomplexation rate may result in high nuclear localization of pDNA and transfection. Understanding in decomplexation and intracellular localization of pDNA may help develop more effective polyplexes.

23550066|t|The CYP2B6*6 Allele Significantly Alters the N-demethylation of Ketamine Enantiomers In Vitro.
23550066|a|Ketamine is primarily metabolized to norketamine by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 and CYP3A4-mediated N-demethylation. However, the relative contribution from each enzyme remains controversial. The CYP2B6*6 allele is associated with reduced enzyme expression and activity that may lead to interindividual variability in ketamine metabolism. We examined the N-demethylation of individual ketamine enantiomers using human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped for the CYP2B6*6 allele, insect cell expressed recombinant CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes and COS-1 cell expressed recombinant CYP2B6.1 and CYP2B6.6 protein variant. Effects of CYP-selective inhibitors on norketamine formation were also determined in HLMs. The two-enzyme Michaelis-Menten model best fitted the HLM kinetic data. The Km value for the high affinity enzyme and the low affinity enzyme were similar to those for the expressed CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, respectively. The intrinsic clearance for both ketamine enantiomers by the high affinity enzyme in HLMs with CYP2B6*1/*1 genotype were at least 2-fold and 6-fold higher, respectively, than those for CYP2B6*1/*6 genotype and CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype. The Vmax and Km values for CYP2B6.1 were approximately 160% and 70% of those for CYP2B6.6, respectively. ThioTEPA (CYP2B6 inhibitor, 25 uM) and the monoclonal antibody against CYP2B6 but not troleandomycin (CYP3A4 inhibitor, 25 uM) or the monoclonal antibody against CYP3A4 inhibited ketamine N-demethylation at clinically relevant concentrations. The degree of inhibition was significantly reduced in HLMs with the CYP2B6*6 allele (gene-dose P<0.05). These results indicate a major role of CYP2B6 in ketamine N-demethylation in vitro and a significant impact of the CYP2B6*6 allele on enzyme-ketamine binding and catalytic activity.

23353658|t|In vitro permeability analysis, pharmacokinetic and brain distribution study in mice of imperatorin, isoimperatorin and cnidilin in Radix Angelicae Dahuricae.
23353658|a|Coumarins are important constituents of Radix Angelicae Dahuricae, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine possess several known bioactivities with potentials in the treatment of central nervous system diseases. By using an HPLC-MS/MS method, we analyzed the in vivo plasma and brain pharmacokinetics of three ingredients of coumarins, including imperatorin, isoimperatorin and cnidilin in mice after oral administration of Dahuricae extract at doses of 800mg/kg. The biosamples were prepared using acetonitrile precipitation and the separation was achieved on an XDB-C18 column by gradient elution. The BBB permeability and P-gp-mediated efflux were further examined in Madin Canine kidney cells transfected with full length cDNA for human multidrug resistance gene1 (MDCKII-MDR1). Our results demonstrate that the method has excellent and satisfactory selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, and accuracy for simultaneous determination of imperatorin, isoimperatorin and cnidilin. The pharmacokinetics parameters were determined by using noncompartmental analyses, including the AUC(0-t) in plasma (1695.22, 1326.45 and 636.98mg*h/L), the AUC(0-t) in brain (1812.35, 2125.17 and 1145.83ng*h/g) as well as the T1/2 in plasma (0.66, 0.82, 0.97h) and brain (0.96, 1.1, 0.99h) for imperatorin, isoimperatorin and cnidilin, respectively, suggesting that the three coumarins could easily pass through the BBB in vivo. In the in vitro model we observed high permeability of imperatorin and isoimperatorin with the P-gp-mediated efflux ratios of 0.53 and 0.06, as well as medium permeability of cnidilin with 0.82. All data suggest that these three coumarins have high BBB permeability and have pharmacokinetic potentials for the treatment of central nervous system diseases.

12560076|t|Mouse brain serine racemase catalyzes specific elimination of L-serine to pyruvate.
12560076|a|D-Serine was previously identified in mammalian brain and was shown to be a co-agonist at the 'glycine' site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type receptors. Racemization of serine is catalyzed by serine racemase, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme expressed mainly in brain and liver. NMDA receptor overactivation has been implicated in a number of pathological conditions and inhibitors of serine racemase are thus potentially interesting targets for therapy. We expressed recombinant mouse serine racemase in insect cells and purified it to near homogeneity. The enzyme is a non-covalent homodimer in solution and requires divalent cations Mg(2+), Ca(2+) or Mn(2+) for activity but not for dimerization. In addition to the racemization it also catalyzes specific elimination of L-Ser to pyruvate. D-Serine is eliminated much less efficiently. Both L-serine racemization and elimination activities of serine racemase are of comparable magnitude, display alkaline pH optimum and are negligible below pH 6.5.

23561109|t|Research on the preparation of antioxidant peptides derived from egg white with assisting of high-intensity pulsed electric field.
23561109|a|Egg white protein powder, one of the main egg products, was hydrolysed by Alcalase, Trypsin, and Pepsin respectively to prepare antioxidant peptides. All hydrolysates were assayed by determination of reducing power (RP) ability. Three kinds of hydrolysates were prepared under optimal enzymatic parameters that were obtained from the preliminary one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) and response surface methodology (RSM) experiments. The results showed that the Alcalase hydrolysates exerted the best RP ability. Thereafter, the Alcalase hydrolysates were sequentially fractionated by ultra filtration membranes in cut-off molecular weight (MW) of 30, 10, and 1kDa, and tested their antioxidant activities in terms of RP ability, DPPH radical scavenging ability, ABTS radical scavenging ability, and FRAP assay. Effects of high intensity pulsed electric field treatment were further investigated on antioxidant peptides to improve their activities. The results showed that Alcalase hydrolysates possessed the strongest antioxidant ability compared with the other two hydrolysates, particularly for the Fraction-3 with MW <1kDa. After PEF treatment, this fraction showed a significant improvement of RP ability within 5h (P<0.05).

9015795|t|Atypical neuroleptics have low affinity for dopamine D2 receptors or are selective for D4 receptors.
9015795|a|This review examines the possible receptor basis of the atypical action of those atypical antipsychotic drugs that elicit low levels of Parkinsonism. Such an examination requires consistent and accurate dissociation constants for the antipsychotic drugs at the relevant dopamine and serotonin receptors. It has long been known, however, that the dissociation constant of a given antipsychotic drug at the dopamine D2 receptor varies between laboratories. Although such variation depends on several factors, it has recently been recognized that the radioligand used to measure the competition between the antipsychotic drug and the radioligand is an important variable. The present review summarizes information on this radioligand dependence. In general, a radioligand of low solubility in the membrane (i.e., low tissue:buffer partition) results in a low value for the antipsychotic dissociation constant when the drug competes with the radioligand. Hence, by first obtaining the antipsychotic dissociation constants using different radioligands of different solubility in the membrane, one can then extrapolate the data to low or "zero" ligand solubility. The extrapolated value represents the radioligand-independent dissociation constant of the antipsychotic. These values are here given for dopamine D2 and D4 receptors, as well as for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. These values, moreover, agree with the dissociation constant directly obtained with the radioactive antipsychotic itself. For example, clozapine revealed a radioligand-independent value of 1.6 nM at the dopamine D4 receptor, agreeing with the value directly measured with [3H]-clozapine at D4. However, because clozapine competes with endogenous dopamine, the in vivo concentration of clozapine (to occupy dopamine D4 receptors) can be derived to be about 13 nM, agreeing with the value of 12 to 20 nM in the plasma water or spinal fluid observed in treated patients. The atypical neuroleptics remoxipride, clozapine, perlapine, seroquel, and melperone had low affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor (radioligand-independent dissociation constants of 30 to 90 nM). Such low affinity makes these latter five drugs readily displaceable by high levels of endogenous dopamine in the caudate or putamen. Most typical neuroleptics have radioligand-independent values of 0.3 to 5 nM at dopamine D2 receptors, making them more resistant to displacement by endogenous dopamine. Finally, a relation was found between the neuroleptic doses for rat catalepsy and the D2:D4 ratio of the radioligand-independent K values for these two receptors. Thus, the atypical neuroleptics appear to fall into two groups, those that have a low affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and those that are selective for dopamine D4 receptors.

23423570|t|High-glucose environment enhanced oxidative stress and increased interleukin-8 secretion from keratinocytes: New insights on impaired diabetic wound healing.
23423570|a|Impaired wound healing frequently occurs in patients with diabetes. Interluekin-8 (IL-8) production by keratinocyte is responsible for recruiting neutrophils during healing. Intense inflammation is associated with diabetic wounds while reduction of neutrophil infiltration is associated with enhanced healing. We hypothesized that increased neutrophil recruitment by keratinocytes may contribute to the delayed healing of diabetic wound. Using cultured human keratinocytes and diabetic rat model, the current study showed that high-glucose environment enhanced IL-8 production via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -extracelluar signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner in keratinocytes. In addition, diabetic rat skin showed enhanced EGFR, ERK and IL-8 expression as compared to control rats. The dermal neutrophil infiltration of the wound, as represented by expression of myeloperoxidase level, was also significantly higher in diabetic rats. Treating diabetic rats with dapsone, an agent known to inhibit neutrophil function, was associated with improved healing. In conclusion, IL-8 production and neutrophil infiltration are increased in high-glucose environment due to elevated ROS level and contributed to impaired wound healing in diabetic skin. Targeting these dysfunctions may present novel therapeutic approaches.

22301814|t|Green tea extract alleviates arsenic-induced biochemical toxicity and lipid peroxidation in rats.
22301814|a|The present work was undertaken to evaluate the protective effect of an aqueous extract of green tea (GT, Camellia sinensis) leaves against arsenic (NaAsO2)-induced biochemical toxicity and lipid peroxidation production in experimental rats. The treatment with arsenic exhibited a significant increase in some serum hepatic and renal biochemical parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, bilirubin, cholesterol, urea and creatinine). But the co-administration of GT has increased the level of plasmatic concentration of biochemical parameters. Exposure of rats to arsenic caused also a significant increase in liver, kidney and testicular thiobarbituric acid reactive substances compared to control. However, the co-administration of GT was effective in reducing its level. To conclude, our data suggest that arsenic exposure enhanced an oxidative stress by disturbing the tissue antioxidant defense system, but the GT co-administration alleviates the toxicity induced by arsenic exposure.

22876943|t|Anti-inflammatory trends of 1, 3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-one derivatives.
22876943|a|Chalcones (1, 3-Diphenyl-2-propen-1-one) are constituted by a three carbon a, b-unsaturated carbonyl system. The biosynthesis of flavonoids and isoflavonoids is initiated by chalcones. Notable pharmacological activities of chalcones and its derivatives include anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antibacterial, antimalarial, antituberculosis, antitumor, antimicrobial and antiviral effects respectively. Owing to simplicity of the chemical structures and a huge variety of pharmacological actions exhibited, the entities derived from chalcones are subjected to extensive consideration. This review article is an effort to sum up the anti-inflammatory activities of chalcone derived chemical entities. Effect of chalcones on lipid peroxidation, heme oxygenase 1(HO-1), cyclooxygenase (COX), interleukin 5 (IL-5), nitric oxide (NO) and expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) is summarized stepwise.

3299141|t|Localization of L-glutamate decarboxylase and GABA transaminase immunoreactivity in the sympathetic ganglia of the rat.
3299141|a|The location of L-glutamate decarboxylase and gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA)-transaminase immunoreactivity in the superior cervical ganglion and in the coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex of the rat was studied by an indirect immunofluorescence method and by immunoelectron microscopy, with specific antisera raised in rabbits against the corresponding enzymes. In light microscopy, several glutamate decarboxylase- or GABA-transaminase-immunoreactive principal nerve cells were detected in the superior cervical ganglion and coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex. In addition, numerous small cells in both the superior cervical ganglion and coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex showed intense immunoreactivity to glutamate decarboxylase or GABA-transaminase. The small cells were 10-20 micron in diameter and resembled in size and morphology the small intensely fluorescent cells. In consecutive sections, the small glutamate decarboxylase-immunoreactive cell clusters also showed immunoreactivity to tyrosine hydroxylase, suggesting that these cells contain the enzymes for both GABA and catecholamine synthesis. In the superior cervical ganglion and in the coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex, GABA-transaminase immunoreactivity was also localized in fibre-like processes around and between the principal nerve cells, in nerve trunks traversing the ganglia, and around or in close contact with ganglionic blood vessels. Furthermore, GABA-transaminase immunoreactivity was observed in fibre-like structures close to the capsule of the ganglia. Division of the preganglionic nerve trunk of the superior cervical ganglion caused no detectable change in GABA-transaminase immunoreactivity in the ganglion. In immunoelectron microscopy of the superior cervical ganglion, GABA-transaminase immunoreactivity was localized in nerve fibres in association with neurotubules. A large number of GABA-transaminase labelled principal nerve cells were detected, containing immunoreactivity evenly distributed in their cytoplasm. GABA-transaminase immunoreactivity was also observed in satellite cells and their processes in the superior cervical ganglion. The present immunocytochemical results provide evidence that the rat sympathetic ganglia contain an intrinsic neuronal system showing histochemical markers for GABA synthesis and inactivation, but its functional role in the modulation of ganglionic neurotransmission remains to be established.

12123767|t|A novel SCN5A arrhythmia mutation, M1766L, with expression defect rescued by mexiletine.
12123767|a|OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene, SCN5A, cause congenital long QT syndrome (LQT3), Brugada syndrome, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and conduction disease by distinct cellular and clinical electrophysiological phenotypes. METHODS: Postmortem molecular analysis of SCN5A was conducted on an infant who presented shortly after birth with self-terminating torsades de pointes. The infant was treated with lidocaine, propranolol, and mexiletine and was stable for 16 months manifesting only a prolonged QT interval. The infant collapsed suddenly following presumed viral gastroenteritis, was found in 2:1 AV block, and was subsequently declared brain dead. Genomic DNA was subjected to SCN5A mutational analyses and DNA sequencing revealing a novel, spontaneous germline missense mutation, M1766L. The M1766L mutation was engineered into the hH1a clone by site-directed mutagenesis, transfected into embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293), and studied by voltage clamp. RESULTS: The M1766L mutation caused a significant decrease in the sodium channel expression. Co-expression with beta1 subunit, incubation at low temperature, and most effectively incubation with mexiletine partially 'rescued' the defective expression. In addition to this pronounced loss of function, M1766L also showed a 10-fold increase in the persistent late sodium current. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that M1766L-SCN5A channel dysfunction may contribute to the basis of lethal arrhythmias, displays an overlapping electrophysiological phenotype, and represents the first sodium channelopathy rescued by drug.

23294255|t|Development of new cyclic plasmin inhibitors with excellent potency and selectivity.
23294255|a|The trypsin-like serine protease plasmin is a target for the development of antifibrinolytic drugs for use in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass or organ transplantations to reduce excessive blood loss. The optimization of our recently described substrate-analogue plasmin inhibitors, which were cyclized between their P3 and P2 side chains, provided a new series with improved efficacy and excellent selectivity. The most potent inhibitor 8 binds to plasmin with an inhibition constant of 0.2 nM, whereas K(i) values >1 uM were determined for nearly all other tested trypsin-like serine proteases, with the exception of trypsin, which is also inhibited in the nanomolar range. Docking studies revealed a potential binding mode in the widely open active site of plasmin that explains the strong potency and selectivity profile of these inhibitors. The dialkylated piperazine-linker segment contributes to an excellent solubility of all analogues. Based on their overall profile the presented inhibitors are well suited for further development as injectable antifibrinolytic drugs.

1526623|t|Ketoconazole binds to the human androgen receptor.
1526623|a|Ketoconazole, an imidazole anti-fungal agent, has often produced features of androgen deficiency including decreased libido, gynecomastia, impotence, oligospermia, and decreased testosterone levels, in men being treated for chronic mycotic infections. Based on these potent effects on gonadal function in vivo as well as previous work in vitro demonstrating affinity of ketoconazole for receptor proteins for glucocorticoids and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and for sex steroid binding globulin (SSBG), the binding of ketoconazole to human androgen receptors (AR) in vitro was also examined. Ketoconazole competition with [3H]methyltrienolone (R1881) for androgen binding sites in dispersed, intact cultured human skin fibroblasts was determined at 22 degrees C. Fifty percent displacement of [3H]R1881 binding to AR was achieved by 6.4 +/- 1.8 (SE) x 10(-5) M ketoconazole. Additional binding studies performed with ketoconazole in the presence of increasing amounts of [3H]R1881 showed that the interaction of ketoconazole with AR was competitive when the data were analyzed by the Scatchard method. It should be noted, however, that the dose of ketoconazole required for 50% occupancy of the androgen receptor is not likely to be achieved in vivo, at least in plasma. Finally, androgen binding studies performed with other imidazoles, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, and fluconozole, revealed that in this class of compounds only ketoconazole appears to interact with the androgen receptor. Ketoconazole appears to be the first example of a non-steroidal compound which binds competitively to both SSBG and multiple steroid hormone receptors, suggesting that the ligand binding sites of these proteins share some features in common.

23454145|t|Relative expression of cholesterol transport-related proteins and inflammation markers through the induction of 7-ketosterol-mediated stress in Caco-2 cells.
23454145|a|Human diets contain sterol oxidation products that can induce cytotoxic effects, mainly caused by cholesterol oxides. However, phytosterol oxides effects have been less extensively investigated. This study evaluates the production of inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1b, IL-8, IL-10, TNFa) and the influence of gene expression transporters and enzymes related to cholesterol absorption and metabolism (NPC1L1, ABCG5/8, HMGCoA, ACAT) produced by 7-ketosterols (stigmasterol/cholesterol) in Caco-2 cells. These effects were linked to intracellular signaling pathways by using several inhibitors. Results showed 7-ketostigmasterol to have a greater proinflammatory potential than 7-ketocholesterol. In non-pre-treated cells, only efflux transporters were down-regulated by 7-ketosterols, showing a greater influence upon ABCG5 expression. Cell-pre-incubation with bradykinin induced changes in ABCG expression levels after 7-ketostigmasterol-incubation; however, the energetic metabolism inhibition reduced NPC1L1 expression only in 7-ketocholesterol-incubated cells. In non-pre-treated cells, HMG-CoA was up-regulated by both 7-ketosterols. However, exposure to inhibitors down-regulated the expression levels, mainly in 7-ketocholesterol-incubated cells. While ACAT expression values in non-pre-treated cells were unchanged, exposure to inhibitors caused down-regulation of mRNA levels. These results suggest that internalization and excretion of 7-ketostigmasterol is probably influenced by [Ca]i, which also could mediate HMGCoA activity in POPs metabolism. However, energetic metabolism and reducing equivalents exert different influences upon the 7-ketosterol internalization.

23115221|t|Novel insights on the effect of nicotine in a murine colitis model.
23115221|a|Studies showed that nicotine has a positive influence on symptoms of ulcerative colitis. In the present study, we explored the effect of nicotine treatment using different routes of administration in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis mouse model. We also investigated the effects of cotinine, a major metabolite of nicotine, in the model. C57BL6 adult male mice were given DSS solution freely in the drinking water for seven consecutive days, and tap water was given thereafter. Disease severity, length of the colon, colon tissue histology, and inflammatory markers, including colonic myeloperoxidase activity and colonic tumor necrosis factor-a levels, were evaluated. The effect of nicotine and cotinine treatments via various different routes of administration were examined the DSS model. In addition, we measured the plasma levels of nicotine and cotinine in our treatment protocols. Administration of low, but not high, doses of oral nicotine in DSS-treated mice resulted in a significant decrease in disease severity, histologic damage scores, as well as colonic level of tumor necrosis factor-a. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine was not seen after chronic s.c. or minipump infusion of the drug. Differences in plasma levels of nicotine and cotinine do not seem to account for this lack of effect. Finally, oral cotinine alone failed to show a significant effect in the DSS model of colitis. These results highlight that dose and route of administration play a critical role in the protective effect of nicotine in the DSS mouse colitis model.

10712236|t|Polyamine depletion delays apoptosis of rat intestinal epithelial cells.
10712236|a|The polyamines spermidine, spermine, and their precursor putrescine are essential for cell growth and the regulation of the cell cycle. Recent studies suggest that excessive accumulation of polyamines favors either malignant transformation or apoptosis, depending on the cell type and the stimulus. This study examines the involvement of polyamines in the induction of apoptosis by the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. In IEC-6 cells, camptothecin induced apoptosis within 6 h, accompanied by detachment of cells. Detached cells showed DNA laddering and caspase 3 induction, characteristic features of apoptosis. Depletion of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine by DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) that is the first rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, decreased the apoptotic index. Delayed apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in caspase 3 activity in polyamine-depleted cells. Addition of putrescine restored the induction of apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the number of detached cells and caspase 3 activity. Polyamine depletion did not change the level of caspase 3 protein. Inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by a specific inhibitor [diethylglyoxal bis-(guanylhydrazone); DEGBG] led to depletion of spermidine and spermine with a significant accumulation of putrescine and induction of ODC. The DEGBG-treated cells showed an increase in apoptosis, suggesting the importance of putrescine in the apoptotic process. Addition of putrescine to DFMO-treated cell extracts did not increase caspase 3 activity. The above results indicate that polyamine depletion delays the onset of apoptosis in IEC-6 cells and confers protection against DNA damaging agents, suggesting that polyamines might be involved in the caspase activating signal cascade.

7554708|t|Effects of nabumetone on prostanoid biosynthesis in humans.
7554708|a|BACKGROUND: The active metabolite of the anti-inflammatory drug nabumetone has been characterized as a selective inhibitor of the inducible prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS). The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of eicosanoid biosynthesis after oral dosing with nabumetone in nine healthy subjects. METHODS: We measured the urinary excretion of products of platelet (11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 [TXB2]) and renal (prostaglandin IF2 alpha [PGF2 alpha]) arachidonate metabolism as in vivo indexes of the constitutive PGHS-1 pathway. Moreover, the production of TXB2 during whole blood clotting was assessed as an index of the cyclooxygenase activity of platelet PGHS-1 ex vivo. RESULTS: At steady state, nabumetone (500 and 1000 mg daily for 7 days) was associated with statistically significant dose-dependent reduction in the urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-TXB2 and serum TXB2 levels by approximately 50% to 70%. However, the drug did not significantly affect the urinary excretion of PGF2 alpha. After discontinuation of nabumetone, urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 excretion and whole blood TXB2 production returned to predrug levels with a similar timecourse that was consistent with the elimination half-life of its active metabolite. The daily administration of low-dose aspirin (40 mg), a selective inhibitor of platelet PGHS-1, caused a cumulative inhibition of urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 and whole blood TXB2 production that recovered with a timecourse consistent with platelet turnover. CONCLUSIONS: Nabumetone does dose-dependently inhibit the cyclooxygenase activity of platelet PGHS-1 of healthy subjects both in vivo and ex vivo. Thus it is unlikely that its safety profile in patients may be related to selective inhibition of the inducible PGHS-2.
