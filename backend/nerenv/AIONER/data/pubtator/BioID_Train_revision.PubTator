44030441002|t|Transfected HEK293 cells expressing GFP-tagged wild-type FMRP fused to the patient NLS motif (GFP-FMR1wt+NLS).
44030441002|a|Unlike the patientFMRP, GFP-FMR1wt+NLS protein is predominantly cytoplasmic and does not aggregate in the nucleus. However, treatment of HEK293 cells expressing GFP-FMR1wt+NLS with leptomycin B-an inhibitor of nuclear export-resulted in the appearance of nucleolar inclusions. This suggests that the presence of a full-length C-terminus facilitates the nuclear export of FMRP in this context. Transfected HEK293 cells expressing a modified version of GFP-tagged patientFMRP, in which the truncation of the C-terminus is reverted by restoring the open reading frame (GFP-FMR1G-ins.[Ct restored]). The patient protein is not detected in the nucleus when the C-terminus is intact; however, nucleolar retention of the protein is observed upon leptomycin B treatment of the transfected cells. In line with results from (A), this suggests that an intact C-terminus enables nuclear export of the FMR1 protein. Data information: Scale bar represents 10 um.

(i) Expression of full-length HA significantly delayed the clearance of CALM at all time points compared with D-ANTH CALM (***P0.001, one-way ANOVA). One graph, representative of three independent experiments, is presented. (CALM-ANTH-HA: 132 cells, 20 fishes; CALM-CALM: 18 cells, 8 fishes). Another two experiments are shown in Supplementary Fig. S5C. Error bars are mean +s.d. (ii) Treatment with CALM alters the dynamics of CALM clearance. Expression of full-length CALM significantly delayed the clearance of CALM at all time points compared with D-ANTH CALM, as observed in i (P0.001, one-way ANOVA). However, treatment of D-ANTH CALM injected CALM with CALM slows the CALM clearance by 70% to a level comparable to that observed in larvae injected with full-length Dendra-tau. Ammonium chloride treatment of Dendra-tau injected with full-length null results in a modest (22%) decrease in Dendra-tau clearance, suggesting that null overexpression and ammonium chloride treatment have a cumulative effect (n>25 cells, n>9 Dendra-tau per treatment group). Error bars are mean +s.d. Note that i and ii are distinct experiments.

As expected UnaG fluorescence is efficiently induced under hypoxia, while mOrange fluorescence only appears after the switch to normoxia only. The increase in both green and orange fluorescence is limited under normoxia by the subsiding HRE-mCMV promoter activity. This behavior is repeated in subsequent hypoxia / normoxia cycles. The increase in absolute fluorescence intensity is due to proliferation during the 72hrs culture period. Plotted is the average of the mean + SEM. c) Visualization of the fluorescence of the dUnOHR reporter during alternating hypoxia / normoxia cycles as described in b.)

In cells with Nox4 knockdown, tunicamycin treatment resulted in lower increases in protein levels of the ER chaperones Grp94, Grp78 and calreticulin than in conrol cells. Nuclear protein levels of ATF4 were substantially lower in Nox4-depleted cells than control cells but the levels of cleaved ATF6 (ATF6c) were similar. Histone was used as a loading control. The relative mRNA levels of Xbp1-s (a readout of IRE1 signaling) were unaltered after Nox4 knockdown. Mean data are shown in Appendix Fig S1E. Similar results were obtained with an independent siRNA approach (Appendix Fig S2A). D. Effect of adenoviral-mediated overexpression of Nox4 (Ad.Nox4) or a control b-galactosidase protein (Ad.b-Gal) on tunicamycin responses of H9c2 cells. Nox4 enhanced the increase in cellular ER chaperones and nuclearATF4 levels but did not affect tunicamycin-induced changes in nuclearATF6c levels and caused minor reduction in Xbp1s mRNA levels.

Omission of IFT54/20 (lane 4), or IFT80 (lane 5) does not influence the binding of any of the other components, but a lack of IFT57/38 in the mixture abolishes detectable pull-downs of IFT54/20 and IFT80 (lane 4), indicating that IFT57/38 is the direct interaction partner of IFT88/52N.

This leads to blockage of GABAergic transmission followed by epileptiform discharges (burst) occurring approximately after 3 min. The zoom-in reveals that such an epileptiform discharge (burst) consists of repetitive firings. B. Similar example trace as in (A) recorded in a hTauAT expressing slice (red) demonstrating an increase in burst frequency as well as in firings per burst due to hTauAT expression. C. Quantification of bursts per minute in DIV 10 slices from control littermates and hTauAT slices demonstrating a ~2-fold increase in hTauAT slices (n=8 slices per group). D. Firings per burst are increased ~1.5-fold already at the early time point DIV10 due to hTauAT expression. E. Analysis of burst frequency in slices at DIV 30 demonstrates the progression of the pathological effect beyond that observed at DIV 10. Burst frequency is enhanced in hTauAT expressing slices (n = 10 slices). If Ceftriaxone (CEF) is applied to hTauAT slices the pathological burst frequency enhancement is partly prevented (n = 5 slices). F. Firings per burst are strongly enhanced due to hTauAT expression in slices at DIV 30.

The percentage of green vesicles colocalizing with red ones was close to 100% for all mutants, that is, virtually no GFP-LC3Avesicles were unrelated to endocytosed chimera (not shown). At least 50 cells were scored per experimental point. The experiment was repeated three times. The graph shows the number of GFP-LC3Avesicles per cell expressed as the percentage of the value obtained for the wild-type chimera (left axis), and the percentage of chimera vesicles labelled with GFP-LC3A (right axis).

49721371000|a|Left: Difference (Fo-Fc) electron density map (mutant minus wildtype) contoured at -2.5  and drawn as red mesh, plotted on the structure of the wildtype (E178) protein, highlighting the consequences of the loss of the D-carbon atom from residue 178 in the E178D mutant. For reference, the locations of the sodium ion sites present in the wildtype (E178) structure are depicted as cyan spheres. Both the structure and the ions are displayed as faded backgrounds so that the difference map can be seen more clearly. Right: Final refined 2Fo-Fc electron density map for the E178D mutant (PDBID 4X88), contoured at 1.5  and shown as grey mesh, with the sodium ions depicted as cyan spheres. B) Surface representations of (left) wildtype NavMs pore and (right) the E178D mutant coloured by electrostatic charge calculated by APBS (Callenberg et al, 2010) and drawn with VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996), showing a slice through the middle of the tetramer. Sodium ions are shown as cyan spheres; only 2 are present in the mutant, instead of the 3 seen in the wildtype, with the top sodium missing in the mutant. The lower panels are expanded views of the selectivity filter regions, with the E178 side chains depicted in yellow sticks and the location of the main chain nitrogen of residue 179 indicated by the black circle. The alteration in the protein structure caused by removal of the methylene group of E178 exposes a positive region of the polypeptide backbone adjacent to the site where the top sodium ion is located in the wildtype protein; this likely contributes to why an equivalent sodium ion is not seen adjacent to this position in the mutant.

46046841018|t|A-D In vitro ubiquitylation assays with purified proteins.
46046841018|a|As ubiquitin is covalently attached to the substrate lysine residue, the appearance of higher molecular weight protein bands reflects the modification of the protein with ubiquitin. All assays contain purified UBE1, UBE2D3, ubiquitin, 0.1 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2 and were buffered in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl and incubated at 30 C for the time indicated. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-Laemmli buffer to a concentration of 1 . SDS-PAGE, staining with Coomassie blue, or detection with the indicated antibody following immunoblotting enabled the visualisation of ubiquitylation. (A) to determine the relative modification of KLHL3 by CUL3WT and CUL3D403-459, KLHL3 was included into the reaction at 2  molar concentration over CUL3WT and CUL3D403-459. (B, C) Reactions serve to determine basal auto-ubiquitylation of CUL3WT or CUL3D403-459 and do not contain KLHL3 or other potential substrate proteins. Lysine residues on CUL3WT or CUL3D403-459 act as the substrate.

In untreated or ATG5-DNES transduced cells, both Aurora B and survivin were recruited to prometaphase centromeres and located at the central spindle during anaphase where they no longer colocalized with centromeres. In contrast, etoposide-treated or ATG5-transduced cells recruited much less Aurora B to prometaphase centromeres. Such recruitment, however, was observed during anaphase. Compared with cells in normal mitosis, survivin, although reduced, was recruited to centromeres in prometaphase, but, similar to Aurora B, remained attached to centromeres during anaphase. Such mislocation of Aurora B and survivin was associated with severe chromosome alignment and segregation defects. Colocalization images were prepared using Imaris software. Numerical analysis was performed and correlation coefficients are indicated. Scale bar, 2 um.

46877851017|t|TBS-brain extracts were applied to a HEK293 cell tauaggregation seeding assay(Holmes et al, 2014, Sanders et al, 2014), in which TauRDP301S-CFP and TauRDP301S-YFP are co-expressed intracellularly.
46877851017|a|The formation of intracellular fluorescent TauRDP301S aggregates leads to Foerster resonance energy transfer (FRET) activity between co-aggregated CFP and YFP-tags and correlates with the tau aggregation seeding activity of the applied brain extracts. After 24 hours, cells treated with extract (0.5 ug and 1.0 ug total protein per 96 well) from 9-month-old rTg4510 had significantly more intracellular YFP-positive (white arrows) aggregates compared to rTg4510-Mapt0/0 extracts; FRET activity of TauRDP301S aggregates appeared similar for both rTg4510 and rTg4510-Mapt0/0. WT and Mapt0/0 extracts never showed seeding activity. Addition of lipofectamine corrected for differences in cellular uptake of tau and led to similar differences in seeding activity between rTg4510 and rTg4510-Mapt0/0 mice. Two-tailed Student's T-test, mean+SEM ns, not significant, Insets 100 um, Scale bars 50 um.

Nine fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and blotted for Dyn2 and the LAMP1 resident protein, LAMP1. Lysosomal acid phosphatase activity roughly correlates with LAMP1 protein levels in each fraction. Levels of Dyn2 are highest in fraction 2, corresponding with both the peak levels of LAMP1 and lysosomal activity. (A) The data shown are from a single representative experiment out of three repeats. (B) Blotting for subcellular components shows that Dyn2 is specific for these same fractions, unlike other organelle markers such as EEA1 (early endosomes) and COXIV (mitochondria).

52908151008|a|Primary humanbreast cancers of the METABRIC dataset were stratified according to high or low YAP activity signature [47] and by TP53 mutational status, and then the levels of the cycline signature score were determined in the four groups. Cyclin activity is significantly higher in mut-p53 tumors with high levels of the YAP signature, as visualized by box-plot. Signature scores have been obtained summarizing the standardized expression levels of signature genes into a combined score with zero mean [7]. The values shown in graphs are thus adimensional. The bottom and top of the box are the first and third quartiles, and the band inside the box is the median; whiskers represent 1st and 99th percentiles; values lower and greater are shown as circles (p<0.0001, n=701).

In control cells (Empty), two Atg16L1 splicing variants, the a- and b-forms, were detected. In full-length b-form-replaced cells (Full), the a-form was not detected, whereas in DWD-replaced cells (DWD) both the a- and b-forms were minimally detected. Thus, we successfully obtained cells that express only endogenous levels of the full-length or DWD mutant.

43391181011|a|After 2 days, transfected cells were lysed with detergent and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) for 2 h with anti Myc antibody at two different temperatures (15 or 25 C), followed by Western blotting (WB) using anti FLAG antibody to determine the amount of dimerized/oligomerized GC proteins (upper panel). These approaches demonstrated that in contrast to GC A, homomeric protein/protein association of GC G seems to be enhanced by cool temperatures (upper panel). Cell lysates were also precipitated and immunoblotted with the anti Myc antibody, demonstrating that cooling does not interfere with immunoprecipitation of Myc tagged GC G via the anti Myc antibody (middle panel). Likewise, precipitation and immunoblotting with the anti FLAG antibody yielded bands of similar intensity for 15 and 25 C, respectively (lower panel). B Relative quantification of homomeric protein/protein association of GC G and GC A was performed by densitometric scanning. Each intensity value from the upper panel was subsequently normalized to the total protein levels as determined in the middle and the lower panel of Fig A (intensity of the immunoreactive bands obtained with the anti Myc or anti FLAG antibody, respectively).

16616841007|t|Immunogold Labeling of ERAs with an Antibody Directed against an ER Membrane Marker (A) Representative section of a cell immunolabeled against a myc-tagged Sec63, an integral ER membrane protein.
16616841007|a|As a primary antibody, we used a rabbit polyclonal anti-myc and, as a secondary, we used 15-nm gold particles-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Nucleus, nuclear envelope, ER, and ERA are indicated as N, NE, ER, and ERA, respectively. (B) High magnification of an electron micrograph of a section of ER. Quantification showed that there are 5 + 2 gold particles per linear micrometer of ER. (C) High magnification of ERAs. To predict how many gold particles one should expect in a particular ERA, we first calculated and averaged the amount of ER (expressed as length in linear micrometers) present in an ERA (similar to the ones shown in Figure 3B), and normalized the value for its area. These calculations determined that there are 20.8 + 3.3 um of ER per um2 inside the ERAs. These values allowed us to predict how many gold particles would be expected over a section of an ERA if it were packed with ER membranes. Two representative ERAs are shown. The ERA shown in the middle picture should hold 2.4 um of ER inside and, therefore, should have 12 gold particles. We counted 12 gold particles. The ERA on the right could contain 2.7 um of ER and should contain14 gold particles; we counted 16 gold particles. The image on the right shows a representative view of a nucleoplasmic region. (D) Quantification of gold-labeling density per area. To assess the signal-to-noise ratio of our immunogold-labeling procedure, we assessed background labeling by counting the number of gold particles over an areas of nucleoplasm (N) and over ERAs, and normalized the counts to the respective areas.

41111351005|t|(b) To determine the impact of curvature on lipidation, we compared liposomes with unphysiologically high surface densities of PE (55 mol%) as have been used in other Atg8 or LC3 lipidation publications (for example, refs , , ), with liposomes having the highest densities of liposomes observed in mammalian organelle membranes (30 mol%).
41111351005|a|At physiologically relevant concentrations of liposomes (30 mol%), lipidation becomes membrane curvature dependent. In vitro coupling reactions were performed as in Fig. 1, except that liposomes were made by extrusion through membranes with different pore diameters (as indicated). Actual diameters of these liposomes were determined by dynamic light scattering (Supplementary Table 1). Top: the lipidation of GL2, GL2 and PE proceeds efficiently and with relatively little curvature dependence on liposomes composed of 55% PE. However, when the liposomes is reduced to 30%, flat liposomes are no longer suitable for lipidation, while highly curved liposomes (100 nm diameter or less) continue to couple effectively. Bottom: to confirm that this curvature dependence reveals the lipidated product and not the intermediate, the 30% reactions were each run on Nycodenz flotation gradients. Only the lipidated product is recovered at the top of the gradient.

Cortical cultures were exposed to aged SNOC control (A-D) or 200 uM SNOC (E-L) for 6 h in the presence of 80 uM zVAD fmk methyl ester. A slice from each tilt series is shown (A, E and I), followed by orthogonal views of 3D reconstructions after segmentation of the OMM (blue) and IMM (gray), with cristae (various arbitrary colors) (B-D, F-H and J-L). For clarity, 10 representative cristae are shown in (B, D, F, G, J and K), while all cristae are displayed in (C, H and L). The control mitochondrion (A-D) is elongated with a dark matrix, indicating no swelling, and 34 cristae. The NO exposed mitochondrion in (E-H) is dividing, and the lower mitochondrion of the couplet shows severe damage, recognized by an outer membrane rupture, a regionally confined inner membrane blowout, slight matrix swelling and cristae fragmentation. Each of the daughter mitochondria is shorter and rounder than controls. Unlike the upper daughter, few of the cristae extend throughout the lower mitochondrion. Additionally, cristae are considerably smaller and regionally confined. The lower mitochondrion of the couplet contains 82 cristae, while the upper contains only 39, indicating cristae fragmentation in the former. The NO exposed mitochondrial triplet in (I-L) displays further damage, including membrane degradation, accumulation of an electron dense mass, greater cristae fragmentation, and apparent mitochondrial fragmentation. All cristae are smaller than controls, with 73 in the top mitochondrion, 112 in the middle, and 47 in the bottom. Scale bars, 400 nm. See Supplementary Video 3, 4 and 5 of tomographic reconstruction.

Like overexpressed Snc1-PEM or Snq2, the ER-resident membrane proteins Sec61 (translocon subunit) and Hmg1 (sterol biogenesis) are transported to the vacuole via macro-ER-phagy. In contrast, the ER-to-Golgi exit regulators Sec12 and Sec13 and the ER lumen chaperone Kar2 are not co-transported to the lysosome through macro-ER-phagy. Four or six different strains were used for this analysis: WT (YPT1), pep4 , and pep4prb1 , ypt1-1, ypt1-1pep4 , and ypt1-1pep4  prb1 . In each strain, one ER-resident protein was tagged at its C-terminus (except for Kar2). (The pep4  strains were not used in all experiments because they do not show the full defect). The level of ER-resident proteins was determined by immunoblot analysis in cells that either do not (B-D) or do overexpress GFP-Snc1-PEM (F-H). B-C. Sec61-3xHA (B) and Sec13-3xHA (C) expressing cells (2 independent un-transformed colonies) were tested by immunoblot analysis (using anti-HA antibodies). Shown from top to bottom: strain genotype, HA-tagged protein, G6PDH (loading control), quantification of HA-tagged protein expressed as average fold of WT (p-value = 0.025 for Sec61).

22343391018|t|(B) Depolarized mitochondria are selectively targeted for autophagy after a multi hour time lag.
22343391018|a|APs are labeled with LC3:GFP, which translocates from the cytosol to the AP's isolation membrane. MTR, a membrane potential dye that stains mitochondria irreversibly and is retained during depolarization, is used to pulse label mitochondria in INS1 cells (14 min, 50 nM) at different time points before detection of APs content. At the time set for detection, cells were treated with pepstatin A (10 uM) and E64d (10 uM) for 30 min to arrest digestion inside the APs, and then subjected to confocal microscopy (see schematic illustration of the Materials and methods). MTR pulse is used here to report on D m during the staining period. While mitochondria outside APs show bright MTR fluorescence, those localized in APs varied in fluorescence based on the time at which they were pulsed with MTR. Note that mitochondria inside APs have dim MTR FI if they were pulsed with MTR1 h before autophagy was detected (circle, top panel), but bright MTR FI if pulsed 24 h before detection of autophagy (circle, bottom panel). Scale bar, 10 um.
