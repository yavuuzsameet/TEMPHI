10022127|t|TIF1gamma, a novel member of the transcriptional intermediary factor 1 family.
10022127|a|We report the cloning and characterization of a novel member of the Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1 (TIF1) gene family, human TIF1gamma. Similar to TIF1alpha and TIF1beta, the structure of TIF1beta is characterized by multiple domains: RING finger, B boxes, Coiled coil, PHD/TTC, and bromodomain. Although structurally related to TIF1alpha and TIF1beta, TIF1gamma presents several functional differences. In contrast to TIF1alpha, but like TIF1beta, TIF1 does not interact with nuclear receptors in yeast two-hybrid or GST pull-down assays and does not interfere with retinoic acid response in transfected mammalian cells. Whereas TIF1alpha and TIF1beta were previously found to interact with the KRAB silencing domain of KOX1 and with the HP1alpha, MODI (HP1beta) and MOD2 (HP1gamma) heterochromatinic proteins, suggesting that they may participate in a complex involved in heterochromatin-induced gene repression, TIF1gamma does not interact with either the KRAB domain of KOX1 or the HP1 proteins. Nevertheless, TIF1gamma, like TIF1alpha and TIF1beta, exhibits a strong silencing activity when tethered to a promoter. Since deletion of a novel motif unique to the three TIF1 proteins, called TIF1 signature sequence (TSS), abrogates transcriptional repression by TIF1gamma, this motif likely participates in TIF1 dependent repression.

10072587|t|Cloning of a novel gene (ING1L) homologous to ING1, a candidate tumor suppressor.
10072587|a|The ING1 gene encodes p33(ING1), a putative tumor suppressor for neuroblastomas and breast cancers, which has been shown to cooperate with p53 in controlling cell proliferation. We have isolated a novel human gene, ING1L, that potentially encodes a PHD-type zinc-finger protein highly homologous to p33(ING1). Fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation-hybrid analyses assigned ING1L to human chromosome 4. Both ING1 and ING1L are expressed in a variety of human tissues, but we found ING1L expression to be significantly more pronounced in tumors from several colon-cancer patients than in normal colon tissues excised at the same surgical sites. Although the significance of this observation with respect to carcinogenesis remains to be established, the data suggest that ING1L might be involved in colon cancers through interference with signal(s) transmitted through p53 and p33(ING1).

10072769|t|Selection of cDNAs encoding putative type II membrane proteins on the cell surface from a human full-length cDNA bank.
10072769|a|We have developed a simple method to test whether a hydrophobic segment near the N-terminus of a protein functions as a type II signal anchor (SA) in which the N-terminus faces the cytoplasm. A cDNA fragment containing the putative SA sequence of a target clone was fused in-frame to the 5' end of a cDNA fragment encoding the protease domain of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). The resulting fused gene was expressed in COS7 cells. Fibrinolytic activity on the cell surface was measured by placing a fibrin sheet in contact with the transfected COS7 cells after removing the medium. When the cDNA fragment encoded a SA, the fibrin sheet was lysed by the u-PA expressed on the cell surface. The fibrinolytic activity was not detected in the culture medium, suggesting that the u-PA remains on the cell surface anchored via the SA in the membrane without being cleaved by signal peptidase. This fibrin sheet method was successfully applied to select five novel cDNA clones encoding putative type II membrane proteins from a human full-length cDNA bank.

10092817|t|C1qRP is a heavily O-glycosylated cell surface protein involved in the regulation of phagocytic activity.
10092817|a|C1q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and pulmonary surfactant protein A (SPA) interact with human monocytes and macrophages, resulting in the enhancement of phagocytosis of suboptimally opsonized targets. mAbs that recognize a cell surface molecule of 126,000 Mr, designated C1qRP, have been shown to inhibit C1q- and MBL-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis. Similar inhibition of the SPA-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis by these mAbs now suggests that C1qRP is a common component of a receptor for these macromolecules. Ligation of human monocytes with immobilized R3, a IgM mAb recognizing C1qRP, also triggers enhanced phagocytic capacity of these cells in the absence of ligand, verifying the direct involvement of this polypeptide in the regulation of phagocytosis. While the cDNA for C1qRP encodes a 631 amino acid membrane protein, Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the cDNA of the C1qRP coding region express a surface glycoprotein with the identical 126,000 Mr in SDS-PAGE as the native C1qRP. Use of glycosylation inhibitors, cleavage of the mature C1qRP with specific glycosidases, and in vitro translation of C1qRP cDNA demonstrated that both posttranslational glycosylation and the nature of the amino acid sequence of the protein contribute to the difference between its predicted m.w. and its migration on SDS-PAGE. These results verify that the cDNA cloned codes for the mature C1qRP, that C1qRP contains a relatively high degree of O-linked glycoslyation, and that C1qRP cross-linked directly by monoclonal anti-C1qRP or engaged as a result of cell surface ligation of SPA, as well as C1q and MBL, enhances phagocytosis.

10192385|t|A mutation in OTOF, encoding otoferlin, a FER-1-like protein, causes DFNB9, a nonsyndromic form of deafness.
10192385|a|Using a candidate gene approach, we identified a novel human gene, OTOF, underlying an autosomal recessive, nonsyndromic prelingual deafness, DFNB9. The same nonsense mutation was detected in four unrelated affected families of Lebanese origin. OTOF is the second member of a mammalian gene family related to Caenorhabditis elegans fer-1. It encodes a predicted cytosolic protein (of 1,230 aa) with three C2 domains and a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain. The sequence homologies and predicted structure of otoferlin, the protein encoded by OTOF, suggest its involvement in vesicle membrane fusion. In the inner ear, the expression of the orthologous mouse gene, mainly in the sensory hair cells, indicates that such a role could apply to synaptic vesicles.

10197527|t|Slit2-Mediated chemorepulsion and collapse of developing forebrain axons.
10197527|a|Diffusible chemorepellents play a major role in guiding developing axons toward their correct targets by preventing them from entering or steering them away from certain regions. Genetic studies in Drosophila revealed a novel repulsive guidance system that prevents inappropriate axons from crossing the CNS midline; this repulsive system is mediated by the Roundabout (Robo) receptor and its secreted ligand Slit. In rodents, Robo and Slit are expressed in the spinal cord and Slit can repel spinal motor axons in vitro. Here, we extend these findings into higher brain centers by showing that Robo1 and Robo2, as well as Slit1 and Slit2, are often expressed in complementary patterns in the developing forebrain. Furthermore, we show that human Slit2 can repel olfactory and hippocampal axons and collapse their growth cones.

10215850|t|Human mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase cDNA cloning, expression and genomic organization.
10215850|a|We have isolated a 1918-bp cDNA from a human adrenal cDNA library which encodes a novel thioredoxin reductase (TrxR2) of 521 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 56.2 kDa. It is highly homologous to the previously described cytosolic enzyme (TrxR1), including the conserved active site CVNVGC and the FAD-binding and NADPH-binding domains. However, human TrxR2 differs from human TrxR1 by the presence of a 33-amino acid extension at the N-terminus which has properties characteristic of a mitochondrial translocation signal. Northern-blot analysis identified one mRNA species of 2.2 kb with highest expression in prostate, testis and liver. We expressed human TrxR2 as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein and showed that in vivo it is localized in mitochondria. Removal of the mitochondrial targeting sequence abolishes the mitochondrial translocation. Finally, we determined the genomic organization of the human TrxR2 gene, which consists of 18 exons spanning about 67 kb, and its chromosomal localization at position 22q11.2.

10235266|t|Ligand-dependent transcription activation by nuclear receptors requires the DRIP complex.
10235266|a|Nuclear receptors modulate the transcription of genes in direct response to small lipophilic ligands. Binding to ligands induces conformational changes in the nuclear receptors that enable the receptors to interact with several types of cofactor that are critical for transcription activation (transactivation). We previously described a distinct set of ligand-dependent proteins called DRIPs, which interact with the vitamin D receptor (VDR); together, these proteins constitute a new cofactor complex. DRIPs bind to several nuclear receptors and mediate ligand-dependent enhancement of transcription by VDR and the thyroid-hormone receptor in cell-free transcription assays. Here we report the identities of thirteen DRIPs that constitute this complex, and show that the complex has a central function in hormone-dependent transactivation by VDR on chromatin templates. The DRIPs are almost indistinguishable from components of another new cofactor complex called ARC, which is recruited by other types of transcription activators to mediate transactivation on chromatin-assembled templates. Several DRIP/ARC subunits are also components of other potentially related cofactors, such as CRSP, NAT, SMCC and the mouse Mediator, indicating that unique classes of activators may share common sets or subsets of cofactors. The role of nuclear-receptor ligands may, in part, be to recruit such a cofactor complex to the receptor and, in doing so, to enhance transcription of target genes.

10235267|t|Composite co-activator ARC mediates chromatin-directed transcriptional activation.
10235267|a|Gene activation in eukaryotes is regulated by complex mechanisms in which the recruitment and assembly of the transcriptional machinery is directed by gene- and cell-type-specific DNA-binding proteins. When DNA is packaged into chromatin, the regulation of gene activation requires new classes of chromatin-targeting activity. In humans, a multisubunit cofactor functions in a chromatin-selective manner to potentiate synergistic gene activation by the transcriptional activators SREBP-1a and Sp1. Here we show that this activator-recruited cofactor (ARC) interacts directly with several different activators, including SREBP-1a, VP16 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB, and strongly enhances transcription directed by these activators in vitro with chromatin-assembled DNA templates. The ARC complex consists of 16 or more subunits; some of these are novel gene products, whereas others are present in other multisubunit cofactors, such as CRSP, NAT and mammalian Mediator. Detailed analysis indicates that the ARC complex is probably identical to the nuclear hormone-receptor cofactor DRIP. Thus, ARC/DRIP is a large composite co-activator that belongs to a family of related cofactors and is targeted by different classes of activator to mediate transcriptional stimulation.

10369880|t|Myotilin, a novel sarcomeric protein with two Ig-like domains, is encoded by a candidate gene for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.
10369880|a|The striated muscle sarcomeres are highly organized structures composed of actin (thin) and myosin (thick) filaments that slide past each other during contraction. The integrity of sarcomeres is controlled by a set of structural proteins, among which are titin, a giant molecule that contains several immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and associates with thin and thick filaments, and -actinin, an actin cross-linking protein. Mutations in several sarcomeric and sarcolemmal proteins have been shown to result in muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. On the other hand, the disease genes underlying several disease forms remain to be identified. Here we describe a novel 57 kDa cytoskeletal protein, myotilin. Its N-terminal sequence is unique, but the C-terminal half contains two Ig-like domains homologous to titin. Myotilin is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, it co-localizes with -actinin in the sarcomeric I--bands and directly interacts with -actinin. The human myotilin gene maps to chromosome 5q31 between markers AFM350yB1 and D5S500. The locus of a dominantly inherited limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1A) resides in an overlapping narrow segment, and a new type of distal myopathy with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness (VCPMD) has been mapped to the same locus. The muscle specificity and apparent role as a sarcomeric structural protein raise the possibility that defects in the myotilin gene may cause muscular dystrophy.

10373484|t|p73 and p63 are homotetramers capable of weak heterotypic interactions with each other but not with p53.
10373484|a|Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most frequent genetic alterations found in human cancers. Recent identification of two human homologues of p53 has raised the prospect of functional interactions between family members via a conserved oligomerization domain. Here we report in vitro and in vivo analysis of homo- and hetero-oligomerization of p53 and its homologues, p63 and p73. The oligomerization domains of p63 and p73 can independently fold into stable homotetramers, as previously observed for p53. However, the oligomerization domain of p53 does not associate with that of either p73 or p63, even when p53 is in 15-fold excess. On the other hand, the oligomerization domains of p63 and p73 are able to weakly associate with one another in vitro. In vivo co-transfection assays of the ability of p53 and its homologues to activate reporter genes showed that a DNA-binding mutant of p53 was not able to act in a dominant negative manner over wild-type p73 or p63 but that a p73 mutant could inhibit the activity of wild-type p63. These data suggest that mutant p53 in cancer cells will not interact with endogenous or exogenous p63 or p73 via their respective oligomerization domains. It also establishes that the multiple isoforms of p63 as well as those of p73 are capable of interacting via their common oligomerization domain.

10380929|t|A striking organization of a large family of human neural cadherin-like cell adhesion genes.
10380929|a|We have identified 52 novel human cadherin-like genes organized into three closely linked clusters. Comparison of the genomic DNA sequences with those of representative cDNAs reveals a striking genomic organization similar to that of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene clusters. The N-terminal extracellular and transmembrane domains of each cadherin protein are encoded by a distinct and unusually large exon. These exons are organized in a tandem array. By contrast, the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of each protein is identical and is encoded by three small exons located downstream from the cluster of N-terminal exons. This unusual organization has interesting implications regarding the molecular code required to establish complex networks of neuronal connections in the brain and the mechanisms of cell-specific cadherin-like gene expression.

10381257|t|Metaxin 1 interacts with metaxin 2, a novel related protein associated with the mammalian mitochondrial outer membrane.
10381257|a|A recently described protein, metaxin 1, serves as a component of a preprotein import complex in the outer membrane of the mammalian mitochondrion. A yeast two-hybrid screen with metaxin 1 as bait has now identified a novel protein, which we have termed metaxin 2, as a metaxin 1-binding protein. Metaxin 2 shares 29% identity with metaxin 1 at the amino acid level, but metaxin 2, unlike metaxin 1, lacks a C-terminal mitochondrial outer membrane signal-anchor domain. Two C. elegans hypothetical proteins, CelZC97.1 and CelF39B2.i, share high sequence similarity with metaxin 2 and metaxin 1, respectively, and likely represent the C. elegans orthologs. Affinity-purified antibodies against metaxin 2 were prepared against the recombinant protein produced in E. coli and were used to analyze the subcellular distribution of metaxin 2. In subcellular fractions of mouse liver, a 29 kD immunoreactive protein, consistent in size with the predicted translation product of metaxin 2 cDNA, was found solely in mitochondria. Alkali extraction of mitochondria indicated that metaxin 2 is peripherally associated with mitochondrial membranes. Metaxin 2 in intact mitochondria was susceptible to digestion with proteinase K, indicating that metaxin 2 is located on the cytosolic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Finally, baculoviruses encoding a His6-tagged metaxin 2 and an untagged metaxin 1 lacking its C-terminal transmembrane domain were produced and used separately or in combination to infect Sf21 insect cells. Metaxin 1 bound to a Ni2+-chelate affinity column only in the presence of metaxin 2, indicating that metaxin 1 and metaxin 2 interact when overexpressed in insect cells. These results suggest that metaxin 2 is bound to the cytosolic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane by means of its interaction with membrane-bound metaxin 1, and that this complex may play a role in protein import into mammalian mitochondria.

10409432|t|Comparative analysis of a novel gene from the Wolf-Hirschhorn/Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome critical region.
10409432|a|Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a multiple malformation syndrome characterized by mental and developmental defects resulting from the absence of a segment of one chromosome 4 short arm (4p16.3). Recently, Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome (PRDS), which is also due to a deletion of chromosome 4p16.3, has been shown to be allelic to WHS. Due to the complex and variable expression of these disorders, it is thought that WHS/PRDS results from a segmental aneusomy of 4p resulting in haploinsufficieny of an undefined number of genes that contribute to the phenotype. In an effort to identify genes that contribute to human development and whose absence may contribute to the phenotype associated with these syndromes, we have generated a transcript map of the 165-kb critical region and have identified a number of potential genes. One of these genes, WHSC2, which was identified with the IMAGE cDNA clone 53283, has been characterized. Sequence analysis defined an open reading frame of 1584 bp (528 amino acids), and transcript analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript in all fetal and adult tissues tested. In parallel, the mouse homologue was isolated and characterized. Mouse sequence analysis and the pattern of expression are consistent with the clone being the murine equivalent of the human WHSC2 gene (designated Whsc2h). The data from sequence and transcript analysis of this new human gene in combination with the lack of significant similarity to proteins of known function imply that it represents a novel gene. Most importantly, its location within the WHSCR suggests that this gene may play a role in the phenotype of the Wolf-Hirschhorn/Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome.   Copyright 1999 Academic Press.

10409438|t|Cloning and mapping of the XRN2 gene to human chromosome 20p11.1-p11.2.
10409438|a|The Dhm1 gene is the mouse homologue of the dhp1(+) gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is involved in homologous recombination and RNA metabolism, such as RNA synthesis and RNA trafficking, in S. pombe. Complementation analysis showed the Dhm1 gene on a multicopy plasmid can rescue the temperature-sensitivity mutation of dhp1(ts) and the lethality of the dhp1 null mutation. This finding suggests that Dhm1 has a function in mouse similar to that of dhp1(+). The human homologue of this gene, XRN2, has been identified. A 3.6-kb transcript of XRN2 was detected in 16 tissues examined and was more abundant in testis. By radiation hybrid panel mapping, the XRN2 gene was localized to chromosome 20p11.1-p11.2 between markers D20S180 and D20S871.   Copyright 1999 Academic Press.

10455022|t|Rab6 is phosphorylated in thrombin-activated platelets by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism: effects on GTP/GDP binding and cellular distribution.
10455022|a|In platelets and other secretory cells, protein kinase C (PKC) plays a role in exocytosis stimulated by physiological extracellular signals, although its linkage to the secretory machinery is poorly understood. We investigated whether Rab6, a GTP-binding protein that fractionates with platelet alpha-granules, may be involved in linking these processes. We found that Rab6 contains two PKC consensus phosphorylation sites that are evolutionarily conserved. In platelets metabolically labelled with P(i), Rab6 phosphorylation was induced by phorbol esters or by thrombin. This phosphorylation was blocked by a specific PKC inhibitor (Ro-31-8220), but not by a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor (PD-169316). Physiological stimulation of platelets caused a PKC-dependent translocation of Rab6 from platelet particulate fractions, nearly doubling the fraction of Rab6 in the cytosol. A human Rab6 isoform (Rab6C) that is preferentially expressed in human platelet RNA was cloned and its phosphorylation by PKC was characterized. Rab6C incorporated up to 2 mol of P(i) per mol of active protein. Rab6C bound GDP and GTP with K(d) values of 113+/-12 and 119+/-27 nM respectively, and hydrolysed GTP at a rate of 100+/-15 micromol of GTP/mol of Rab6C per min. PKC phosphorylation of Rab6C increased the affinity for GTP by 3-fold, although it had lesser effects on GDP (1.6-fold). Phosphorylation did not alter the GTPase activity. In summary, thrombin activation of platelets leads to PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Rab6 and a translocation of Rab6 to the cytosol. We suggest that PKC phosphorylation may be an important mechanism through which Rab functional interactions in vesicle trafficking and secretion can be altered in response to an external stimulus.

10455115|t|Redox regulation of cell signaling by selenocysteine in mammalian thioredoxin reductases.
10455115|a|The intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species, together with the thioredoxin and glutathione systems, is thought to participate in redox signaling in mammalian cells. The activity of thioredoxin is dependent on the redox status of thioredoxin reductase (TR), the activity of which in turn is dependent on a selenocysteine residue. Two mammalian TR isozymes (TR2 and TR3), in addition to that previously characterized (TR1), have now been identified in humans and mice. All three TR isozymes contain a selenocysteine residue that is located in the penultimate position at the carboxyl terminus and which is encoded by a UGA codon. The generation of reactive oxygen species in a human carcinoma cell line was shown to result in both the oxidation of the selenocysteine in TR1 and a subsequent increase in the expression of this enzyme. These observations identify the carboxyl-terminal selenocysteine of TR1 as a cellular redox sensor and support an essential role for mammalian TR isozymes in redox-regulated cell signaling.

10458166|t|A SMAD ubiquitin ligase targets the BMP pathway and affects embryonic pattern formation.
10458166|a|The TGF-beta superfamily of proteins regulates many different biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation and embryonic pattern formation. TGF-beta-like factors signal across cell membranes through complexes of transmembrane receptors known as type I and type II serine/threonine-kinase receptors, which in turn activate the SMAD signalling pathway. On the inside of the cell membrane, a receptor-regulated class of SMADs are phosphorylated by the type-I-receptor kinase. In this way, receptors for different factors are able to pass on specific signals along the pathway: for example, receptors for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) target SMADs 1, 5 and 8, whereas receptors for activin and TGF-beta target SMADs 2 and 3. Phosphorylation of receptor-regulated SMADs induces their association with Smad4, the 'common-partner' SMAD, and stimulates accumulation of this complex in the nucleus, where it regulates transcriptional responses. Here we describe Smurf1, a new member of the Hect family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Smurf1 selectively interacts with receptor-regulated SMADs specific for the BMP pathway in order to trigger their ubiquitination and degradation, and hence their inactivation. In the amphibian Xenopus laevis, Smurf1 messenger RNA is localized to the animal pole of the egg; in Xenopus embryos, ectopic Smurf1 inhibits the transmission of BMP signals and thereby affects pattern formation. Smurf1 also enhances cellular responsiveness to the Smad2 (activin/TGF-beta) pathway. Thus, targeted ubiquitination of SMADs may serve to control both embryonic development and a wide variety of cellular responses to TGF-beta signals.

10491302|t|Identification of a Wnt-responsive signal transduction pathway in primary endothelial cells.
10491302|a|The beta-catenin signal transduction pathway, which can be activated by secreted Wnt proteins, plays a key role in normal embryonic development and in malignant transformation of the mammary gland and colon. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that Wnt and beta-catenin signaling also function in cells of the vasculature. RT-PCR analysis showed that primary endothelial and smooth muscle cell cultures, of both mouse and human origin, express members of the Wnt and Wnt receptor (Frizzled) gene families. Transfection of an expression vector for Wnt-1 into primary endothelial cells increased both the free pool of beta-catenin and the transcription from a Lef/tcf-dependent reporter gene construct. Expression of Wnt-1, but not Wnt-5a, also stimulated proliferation of primary endothelial cell cultures. These data show that Wnt and Frizzled proteins can regulate signal transduction, via beta-catenin, in endothelial cells. These findings suggest that Wnt signaling may feature in normal differentiation of the vasculature as well as in pathological settings where endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation is disturbed.

10491763|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor-6: associations between genetic variability and type II diabetes and between genetic variability and estimates of insulin secretion.
10491763|a|The transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-6 is an upstream regulator of several genes involved in the pathogenesis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young. We therefore tested the hypothesis that variability in the HNF-6 gene is associated with subsets of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and estimates of insulin secretion in glucose tolerant subjects.   We cloned the coding region as well as the intron-exon boundaries of the HNF-6 gene. We then examined them on genomic DNA in six MODY probands without mutations in the MODY1, MODY3 and MODY4 genes and in 54 patients with late-onset Type II diabetes by combined single strand conformational polymorphism-heteroduplex analysis followed by direct sequencing of identified variants. An identified missense variant was examined in association studies and genotype-phenotype studies.   We identified two silent and one missense (Pro75 Ala) variant. In an association study the allelic frequency of the Pro75Ala polymorphism was 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.5) in 330 patients with Type II diabetes mellitus compared with 4.2% (2.4-6.0) in 238 age-matched glucose tolerant control subjects. Moreover, in studies of 238 middle-aged glucose tolerant subjects, of 226 glucose tolerant offspring of Type II diabetic patients and of 367 young healthy subjects, the carriers of the polymorphism did not differ from non-carriers in glucose induced serum insulin or C-peptide responses.   Mutations in the coding region of the HNF-6 gene are not associated with Type II diabetes or with changes in insulin responses to glucose among the Caucasians examined.

10531035|t|Identification of a family of human F-box proteins.
10531035|a|F-box proteins are an expanding family of eukaryotic proteins characterized by an approximately 40 aminoacid motif, the F box (so named because cyclin F was one of the first proteins in which this motif was identified) . Some F-box proteins have been shown to be critical for the controlled degradation of cellular regulatory proteins  . In fact, F-box proteins are one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligases called SCFs. The other three subunits are the Skp1 protein; one of the cullin proteins (Cul1 in metazoans and Cdc53 or Cul A in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae); and the recently identified Roc1 protein (also called Rbx1 or Hrt1). SCF ligases bring ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (either Ubc3 or Ubc4) to substrates that are specifically recruited by the different F-box proteins. The need for high substrate specificity and the large number of known F-box proteins in yeast and worms   suggest the existence of a large family of mammalian F-box proteins. Using Skp1 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen and by searching DNA databases, we identified a family of 26 human F-box proteins, 25 of which were novel. Some of these proteins contained WD-40 domains or leucine-rich repeats; others contained either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. We have named the F-box proteins that contain WD-40 domains Fbws, those containing leucine-rich repeats, Fbls, and the remaining ones Fbxs. We have further characterized representative members of these three classes of F-box proteins.

10534401|t|Cloning, characterization, and localization of mouse and human SPO11.
10534401|a|Spo11 is a meiosis-specific protein in yeast that has been found covalently bound to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during the early stages of meiosis. These DSBs initiate homologous recombination, which is required for proper segregation of chromosomes and the generation of genetic diversity during meiosis. Here we report the cloning, characterization, tissue expression, and chromosomal localization of both mouse and human homologues of Spo11. The putative mouse and human proteins are 82% identical and share approximately 25% identity with other family members. Northern blot analysis revealed testis-specific expression for both genes, but RT-PCR results showed ubiquitous expression of at least a portion of Spo11 in mouse. Human SPO11 was also detected in several somatic tissues. Mouse Spo11 was localized to chromosome 2H4, and human SPO11 was localized to chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3, a region amplified in some breast and ovarian tumors.

10534406|t|Human eukaryotic initiation factor EIF2C1 gene: cDNA sequence, genomic organization, localization to chromosomal bands 1p34-p35, and expression.
10534406|a|We report the cloning and characterization of the human eukaryotic protein translation initiation factor EIF2C1 gene. The human EIF2C1 gene consists of 19 exons and 18 introns that span a region of almost 50 kb. It is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 in the region 1p34-p35. This genomic region is frequently lost in human cancers such as Wilms tumors, neuroblastoma, and carcinomas of the breast, liver, and colon. The human EIF2C1 gene is ubiquitously expressed at low to medium levels. Differential polyadenylation and splicing result in a complex transcriptional pattern. The cDNA sequence is 7478 bp long and contains an extremely large 3' untranslated region of 4799 bp with multiple, short repeated segments composed of mono-, tri-, or quattronucleotides interspersed throughout. The human EIF2C1 gene belongs to a multigene family in human. It is highly conserved during evolution, sharing about 90% identity with rabbit eIF2C and 70% identity with plant AGO1 at the amino acid level. These facts suggest that human EIF2C1 might play an important physiological role.   Copyright 1999 Academic Press.

10534407|t|Characterization of copine VII, a new member of the copine family, and its exclusion as a candidate in sporadic breast cancers with loss of heterozygosity at 16q24.3.
10534407|a|In a search for candidate tumor suppressor genes within a 650-kb common region of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 16q24.3 in breast cancer tissues, a 2.6-kb cDNA, named copine VII (CPNE7), was characterized. The gene is 2654 bp and codes for a 633-residue protein with high homology to the other members of the copine family, such as copine I, copine III, and N-copine. The predicted amino acid sequence contains two copies of a C2 domain in the N-terminus. Since these domains have been found in several membrane-binding proteins involved in different intracellular processes, copine VII was viewed as a potential tumor suppressor gene. Mutation analysis was carried out by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of 18 breast tumor tissue samples with ascertained LOH on chromosome 16q24.3. Since only two polymorphisms were identified, no evidence was found to indicate that copine VII is the tumor suppressor gene at 16q24.3 involved in breast cancer.   Copyright 1999 Academic Press.

10548550|t|Characterization of the structure and regulation of two novel isoforms of serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase.
10548550|a|The catalytic domain of serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (SGK) is 54% identical with protein kinase B (PKB) and, like PKB, is activated in vitro by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and in vivo in response to signals that activate phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. Here we identify two novel isoforms of SGK, termed SGK2 and SGK3, whose catalytic domains share 80% amino acid sequence identity with each other and with SGK (renamed SGK1). Like SGK1, the mRNA encoding SGK3 is expressed in all tissues examined, but SGK2 mRNA is only present at significant levels in liver, kidney and pancreas and, at lower levels, in the brain. The levels of SGK2 mRNA in H4IIE cells and SGK3 mRNA in Rat2 fibroblasts are not increased by stimulation with serum or dexamethasone, whereas the level of SGK1 mRNA is increased greatly. SGK2 and SGK3 are activated in vitro by PDK1, albeit more slowly than SGK1, and their activation is accompanied by the phosphorylation of Thr(193) and Thr(253) respectively, the residues equivalent to the Thr in the 'activation loop' of PKB that is targeted by PDK1. The PDK1-catalysed phosphorylation and activation of SGK2 and SGK3, like SGK1, is greatly potentiated by mutating Ser(356) and Ser(419) respectively to Asp, these residues being equivalent to the C-terminal phosphorylation site of PKB. Like SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3 are activated 5-fold via a phosphorylation mechanism when cells are exposed to H(2)O(2) but, in contrast with SGK1, activation is only suppressed partially by inhibitors of PI 3-kinase. SGK2 and SGK3 are activated to a smaller extent by insulin-like growth factor-1 (2-fold) than SGK1 (5-fold). Like PKB and SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3 preferentially phosphorylate Ser and Thr residues that lie in Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Ser/Thr motifs.

10553045|t|Lad, an adapter protein interacting with the SH2 domain of p56lck, is required for T cell activation.
10553045|a|T cell-specific Src family tyrosine kinase, p56lck, plays crucial roles in T cell differentiation, activation, and proliferation. These multiple functions of p56lck are believed to be conducted through the protein-protein interactions with various cellular signaling proteins. To clarify the mechanisms through which p56lck contributes to T cell signaling, we identified the proteins binding to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of p56lck through a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent yeast two-hybrid screening. Subsequent characterization of positive clones revealed the presence of a protein of 366 aa named Lad (Lck-associated adapter protein), which is a potential murine homologue of previously reported TSAd, a T cell-specific adapter protein. Lad contains several protein-protein interaction domains including a zinc-finger motif, an SH2 domain, a proline-rich SH3 binding motif, and several phosphotyrosine sites. Furthermore, Lad was tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with p56lck in vivo and redistributed from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in a T cell activation-dependent manner. Moreover in T cells, IL-2 promoter activity was enhanced upon coexpression of Lad but was inhibited by the coexpression of antisense Lad RNA. These characteristics of Lad suggest that Lad play an essential role as an adapter protein in p56lck-mediated T cell signaling.

10578051|t|Purification, molecular cloning, and genomic organization of human brain long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase.
10578051|a|An acyl-CoA hydrolase, referred to as hBACH, was purified from human brain cytosol. The enzyme had a molecular mass of 100 kDa and 43-kDa subunits, and was highly active with long-chain acyl-CoAs, e.g. a maximal velocity of 295 micromol/min/mg and K(m) of 6.4 microM for palmitoyl-CoA. Acyl-CoAs with carbon chain lengths of C(8-18) were also good substrates. In human brain cytosol, 85% of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity was titrated by an anti-BACH antibody, which accounted for over 75% of the enzyme activity found in the brain tissue. The cDNA isolated for hBACH, when expressed in Escherichia coli, directed the expression of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity and a 44-kDa protein immunoreactive to the anti-BACH antibody, which in turn neutralized the hydrolase activity. The hBACH cDNA encoded a 338-amino acid sequence which was 95% identical to that of a rat homolog. The hBACH gene spanned about 130 kb and comprised 9 exons, and was mapped to 1p36.2 on the cytogenetic ideogram. These findings indicate that the long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase present in the brain is well conserved between man and the rat, suggesting a conserved role for this enzyme in the mammalian brain, and enabling genetic studies on the functional analysis of acyl-CoA hydrolase.

10588946|t|Family of human oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) homologues. A novel member implicated in brain sterol metabolism.
10588946|a|Oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) is a cytosolic protein that undergoes ligand-induced binding to the Golgi apparatus and has been implicated in the regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae an OSBP homologue is involved in membrane trafficking through the Golgi complex. Prompted by the multitude of OSBP-related genes in the yeast genome, we carried out a search for human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) displaying homology to the sterol-binding domain of OSBP. This revealed a minimum of six novel OSBP-related proteins, designated ORP-1 to ORP-6. ORP cDNA probes were generated by reverse transcription-PCR from human liver mRNA, and used for Northern blot analysis of human tissue transcript panels. This verified that each of them represents a different gene product and showed that they display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns. The ORP-1 and -2 mRNA expression levels were similar to or higher than that of OSBP while the ORP-3 to -6 mRNAs were detected at lower levels in specific tissues. The most abundantly expressed new gene, ORP-1, was transcribed at strikingly high levels in the cortical areas of human brain and displayed sterol-regulated expression in a cultured human neuroblastoma cell line. This indicates that ORP-1 may play an important role in maintaining the sterol balance in cells of the central nervous system. Together with OSBP, the identified gene products constitute a novel human protein family that may provide a link between organellar sterol status and membrane dynamics.

10607832|t|Myoferlin, a candidate gene and potential modifier of muscular dystrophy.
10607832|a|Dysferlin, the gene product of the limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B locus, encodes a membrane-associated protein with homology to Caenorhabditis elegans fer-1. Humans with mutations in dysferlin ( DYSF ) develop muscle weakness that affects both proximal and distal muscles. Strikingly, the phenotype in LGMD 2B patients is highly variable, but the type of mutation in DYSF cannot explain this phenotypic variability. Through electronic database searching, we identified a protein highly homologous to dysferlin that we have named myoferlin. Myoferlin mRNA was highly expressed in cardiac muscle and to a lesser degree in skeletal muscle. However, antibodies raised to myoferlin showed abundant expression of myoferlin in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Within the cell, myoferlin was associated with the plasma membrane but, unlike dysferlin, myoferlin was also associated with the nuclear membrane. Ferlin family members contain C2 domains, and these domains play a role in calcium-mediated membrane fusion events. To investigate this, we studied the expression of myoferlin in the mdx mouse, which lacks dystrophin and whose muscles undergo repeated rounds of degeneration and regeneration. We found upregulation of myoferlin at the membrane in mdx skeletal muscle. Thus, myoferlin ( MYOF ) is a candidate gene for muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy, or possibly a modifier of the muscular dystrophy phenotype.

10607840|t|A novel human odorant-binding protein gene family resulting from genomic duplicons at 9q34: differential expression in the oral and genital spheres.
10607840|a|Lipocalins are carrier proteins for hydrophobic molecules in many biological fluids. In the oral sphere (nasal mucus, saliva, tears), they have an environmental biosensor function and are involved in the detection of odours and pheromones. Herein, we report the first identification of human lipocalins involved in odorant binding. They correspond to a gene family located on human chromosome 9q34 produced by genomic duplications: two new odorant-binding protein genes ( hOBP (IIa) and hOBP (IIb) ), the previously described tear lipocalin LCN1 gene and two new LCN1 pseudogenes. Although 95% similar in sequence, the two hOBP (II) genes were differentially expressed in secretory structures. hOBP (IIa) was strongly expressed in the nasal structures, salivary and lachrymal glands, and lung, therefore having an oral sphere profile. hOBP (IIb) was more strongly expressed in genital sphere organs such as the prostate and mammary glands. Both were expressed in the male deferent ducts and placenta. Surprisingly, alternatively spliced mRNAs resulting in proteins with different C-termini were generated from each of the two genes. The single LCN1 gene in humans generated a putative odorant-binding protein in nasal structures. Finally, based on the proposed successive genomic duplication history, we demonstrated the recruitment of exons within intronic DNA generating diversity. This is consistent with a positive selection pressure in vertebrate evolution in the intron-late hypothesis.

10619843|t|The VacA toxin of Helicobacter pylori identifies a new intermediate filament-interacting protein.
10619843|a|The VacA toxin produced by Helicobacter pylori acts inside cells and induces the formation of vacuoles arising from late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Using VacA as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell library, we have identified a novel protein of 54 kDa (VIP54), which interacts specifically with VacA, as indicated by co-immunoprecipitation and binding experiments. VIP54 is expressed in cultured cells and many tissues, with higher expression in the brain, muscle, kidney and liver. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-VIP54 affinity- purified antibodies shows a fibrous pattern typical of intermediate filaments. Double label immunofluorescence performed on various cell lines with antibodies specific to different intermediate filament proteins revealed that VIP54 largely co-distributes with vimentin. In contrast to known intermediate filament proteins, VIP54 is predicted to contain approximately 50% of helical segments, but no extended coiled-coil regions. The possible involvement of this novel protein in interactions between intermediate filaments and late endosomal compartments is discussed.

10623476|t|Isolation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies directed against subunits of human RNA polymerases I, II, and III.
10623476|a|Human nuclei contain three different RNA polymerases: polymerases I, II, and III. Each polymerase is a multi-subunit enzyme with 12-17 subunits. The localization of these subunits is limited by the paucity of antibodies suitable for immunofluorescence. We now describe eight different monoclonal antibodies that react specifically with RPB6 (also known as RPA20, RPB14.4, or RPC20), RPB8 (RPA18, RPB17, or RPC18), RPC32, or RPC39 and which are suitable for such studies. Each antibody detects one specific band in immunoblots of nuclear extracts; each also immunoprecipitates large complexes containing many other subunits. When used for immunofluorescence, antibodies against the subunits shared by all three polymerases (i.e., RPB6, RPB8) gave a few bright foci in nucleoli and nucleoplasm, as well as many fainter nucleoplasmic foci; all the bright foci were generally distinct from speckles containing Sm antigen. Antibodies against the two subunits found only in polymerase III (i.e., RPC32, RPC39) gave a few bright and many faint nucleoplasmic foci, but no nucleolar foci. Growth in two transcriptional inhibitors-5, 6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole and actinomycin D-led to the redistribution of each subunit in a characteristic manner.

10625670|t|Five members of a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein (CABP) subfamily with similarity to calmodulin.
10625670|a|Five members of a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein subfamily (CaBP), with 46-58% sequence similarity to calmodulin (CaM), were identified in the vertebrate retina. Important differences between these Ca(2+)-binding proteins and CaM include alterations within their second EF-hand loop that render these motifs inactive in Ca(2+) coordination and the fact that their central alpha-helixes are extended by one alpha-helical turn. CaBP1 and CaBP2 contain a consensus sequence for N-terminal myristoylation, similar to members of the recoverin subfamily and are fatty acid acylated in vitro. The patterns of expression differ for each of the various members. Expression of CaBP5, for example, is restricted to retinal rod and cone bipolar cells. In contrast, CaBP1 has a more widespread pattern of expression. In the brain, CaBP1 is found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and in the retina this protein is found in cone bipolar and amacrine cells. CaBP1 and CaBP2 are expressed as multiple, alternatively spliced variants, and in heterologous expression systems these forms show different patterns of subcellular localization. In reconstitution assays, CaBPs are able to substitute functionally for CaM. These data suggest that these novel CaBPs are an important component of Ca(2+)-mediated cellular signal transduction in the central nervous system where they may augment or substitute for CaM.

10628838|t|Leukolysin/MMP25/MT6-MMP: a novel matrix metalloproteinase specifically expressed in the leukocyte lineage.
10628838|a|A novel matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) was identified from leukocytes and found to be specifically expressed by peripheral blood leukocytes among 29 different tissues examined. Named leukolysin, it encodes for 562 residues with a conserved MMP structure, i.e., pre-, pro-, catalytic, hinge- and hemopexin-like domains, but also a RXK/RR motif, known for its role in MMP zymogen activation, and a C-terminal hydrophobic segment. Overall, leukolysin displays the strongest homology to the newly identified MT-MMP subgroup with 45% and 39% identities to MT4- and MT1-MMPs vs 30% and 31.5% to MMP1 and 3 respectively. Unlike MT4-MMP whose proteolytic activity remains undefined, a C-terminally truncated leukolysin is expressed as a strong gelatinolytic species at 28 kDa which is derived from a cell-associated 34 kDa proenzyme, presumably by furin or proprotein convertase mediated removal of the propeptide (approximately 6 kDa). By green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging, the intracellular proenzyme is localized to granules throughout the cell, suggesting that activation occur immediately prior to secretion. Taken together, leukolysin may be part of the proteolytic arsenal deployed by leukocytes during inflammatory responses. Molecular cloning of a novel MMP: MMP:25

10647011|t|Chromosome instability and immunodeficiency syndrome caused by mutations in a DNA methyltransferase gene.
10647011|a|The recessive autosomal disorder known as ICF syndrome (for immunodeficiency, centromere instability and facial anomalies; Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 242860) is characterized by variable reductions in serum immunoglobulin levels which cause most ICF patients to succumb to infectious diseases before adulthood. Mild facial anomalies include hypertelorism, low-set ears, epicanthal folds and macroglossia. The cytogenetic abnormalities in lymphocytes are exuberant: juxtacentromeric heterochromatin is greatly elongated and thread-like in metaphase chromosomes, which is associated with the formation of complex multiradiate chromosomes. The same juxtacentromeric regions are subject to persistent interphase self-associations and are extruded into nuclear blebs or micronuclei. Abnormalities are largely confined to tracts of classical satellites 2 and 3 at juxtacentromeric regions of chromosomes 1, 9 and 16. Classical satellite DNA is normally heavily methylated at cytosine residues, but in ICF syndrome it is almost completely unmethylated in all tissues. ICF syndrome is the only genetic disorder known to involve constitutive abnormalities of genomic methylation patterns. Here we show that five unrelated ICF patients have mutations in both alleles of the gene that encodes DNA methyltransferase 3B (refs 5, 6). Cytosine methylation is essential for the organization and stabilization of a specific type of heterochromatin, and this methylation appears to be carried out by an enzyme specialized for the purpose.

10681536|t|Functional expression of the human hZIP2 zinc transporter.
10681536|a|Zinc is an essential nutrient for humans, yet we know little about how this metal ion is taken up by mammalian cells. In this report, we describe the characterization of hZip2, a human zinc transporter identified by its similarity to zinc transporters recently characterized in fungi and plants. hZip2 is a member of the ZIP family of eukaryotic metal ion transporters that includes two other human genes, hZIP1 and hZIP3, and genes in mice and rats. To test whether hZip2 is a zinc transporter, we examined (65)Zn uptake activity in transfected K562 erythroleukemia cells expressing hZip2 from the CMV promoter. hZip2-expressing cells accumulated more zinc than control cells because of an increased initial zinc uptake rate. This activity was time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent and saturable with an apparent K(m) of 3 microM. hZip2 zinc uptake activity was inhibited by several other transition metals, suggesting that this protein may transport other substrates as well. hZip2 activity was not energy-dependent, nor did it require K(+) or Na(+) gradients. Zinc uptake by hZip2 was stimulated by HCO(3)(-) treatment, suggesting a Zn(2+)-HCO(3)(-) cotransport mechanism. Finally, hZip2 was exclusively localized in the plasma membrane. These results indicate that hZip2 is a zinc transporter, and its identification provides one of the first molecular tools to study zinc uptake in mammalian cells.

10692449|t|Cloning and functional characterization of novel large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel beta subunits, hKCNMB3 and hKCNMB4.
10692449|a|We present the cloning and characterization of two novel calcium-activated potassium channel beta subunits, hKCNMB3 and hKCNMB4, that are enriched in the testis and brain, respectively. We compare and contrast the steady state and kinetic properties of these beta subunits with the previously cloned mouse beta1 (mKCNMB1) and the human beta2 subunit (hKCNMB2). Once inactivation is removed, we find that hKCNMB2 has properties similar to mKCNMB1. hKCNMB2 slows Hslo1 channel gating and shifts the current-voltage relationship to more negative potentials. hKCNMB3 and hKCNMB4 have distinct effects on slo currents not observed with mKCNMB1 and hKCNMB2. Although we found that hKCNMB3 does interact with Hslo channels, its effects on Hslo1 channel properties were slight, increasing Hslo1 activation rates. In contrast, hKCNMB4 slows Hslo1 gating kinetics, and modulates the apparent calcium sensitivity of Hslo1. We found that the different effects of the beta subunits on some Hslo1 channel properties are calcium-dependent. mKCNMB1 and hKCNMB2 slow activation at 1 microM but not at 10 microM free calcium concentrations. hKCNMB4 decreases Hslo1 channel openings at low calcium concentrations but increases channel openings at high calcium concentrations. These results suggest that beta subunits in diverse tissue types fine-tune slo channel properties to the needs of a particular cell.

10693807|t|Positional cloning of zebrafish ferroportin1 identifies a conserved vertebrate iron exporter.
10693807|a|Defects in iron absorption and utilization lead to iron deficiency and overload disorders. Adult mammals absorb iron through the duodenum, whereas embryos obtain iron through placental transport. Iron uptake from the intestinal lumen through the apical surface of polarized duodenal enterocytes is mediated by the divalent metal transporter, DMTi. A second transporter has been postulated to export iron across the basolateral surface to the circulation. Here we have used positional cloning to identify the gene responsible for the hypochromic anaemia of the zebrafish mutant weissherbst. The gene, ferroportin1, encodes a multiple-transmembrane domain protein, expressed in the yolk sac, that is a candidate for the elusive iron exporter. Zebrafish ferroportin1 is required for the transport of iron from maternally derived yolk stores to the circulation and functions as an iron exporter when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Human Ferroportin1 is found at the basal surface of placental syncytiotrophoblasts, suggesting that it also transports iron from mother to embryo. Mammalian Ferroportin1 is expressed at the basolateral surface of duodenal enterocytes and could export cellular iron into the circulation. We propose that Ferroportin1 function may be perturbed in mammalian disorders of iron deficiency or overload.

10704444|t|PEX19 binds multiple peroxisomal membrane proteins, is predominantly cytoplasmic, and is required for peroxisome membrane synthesis.
10704444|a|Peroxisomes are components of virtually all eukaryotic cells. While much is known about peroxisomal matrix protein import, our understanding of how peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are targeted and inserted into the peroxisome membrane is extremely limited. Here, we show that PEX19 binds a broad spectrum of PMPs, displays saturable PMP binding, and interacts with regions of PMPs required for their targeting to peroxisomes. Furthermore, mislocalization of PEX19 to the nucleus leads to nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized PMPs. At steady state, PEX19 is bimodally distributed between the cytoplasm and peroxisome, with most of the protein in the cytoplasm. We propose that PEX19 may bind newly synthesized PMPs and facilitate their insertion into the peroxisome membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the loss of PEX19 results in degradation of PMPs and/or mislocalization of PMPs to the mitochondrion.

10706098|t|Human MT6-matrix metalloproteinase: identification, progelatinase A activation, and expression in brain tumors.
10706098|a|The localization of proteolytic enzymes at the cell surface is a widely used strategy for facilitating tumor invasion. In this study, we have cloned a new member of the membrane-type subfamily of matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs), a group of enzymes associated with tumor progression. The cloned cDNA encodes a protein of 562 amino acids with a domain organization similar to that of other MT-MMPs, including a prodomain with a cysteine switch, a catalytic domain with the zinc-binding site, a hemopexin-like domain, and a COOH-terminal extension rich in hydrophobic residues. The predicted protein sequence also contains a short insertion of basic residues located between the propeptide and the catalytic domain and involved in the proteolytic activation of MT-MMPs by furin-like enzymes. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of COS-7 cells transfected with the isolated cDNA revealed that the encoded protein is localized at the cell surface. Based on these properties, this novel human matrix metalloproteinase has been called MT6-MMP because it is the sixth identified member of this subfamily of matrix metalloproteinase. Cotransfection of expression plasmids encoding MT6-MMP and progelatinase A resulted in activation of COS-7-secreted progelatinase A, as demonstrated by gelatin zymography. In contrast, transfection of progelatinase A cDNA alone did not lead to the activation of the proenzyme. Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNAs isolated from human tissues demonstrated that MT6-MMP is predominantly expressed in leukocytes, lung, and spleen. MT6-MMP was also detected at high levels in SW480 colon carcinoma cells as well as in some anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas, but not in normal colon or brain or in meningiomas. On the basis of these results, we propose that MT6-MMP may facilitate tumor progression through its ability to activate progelatinase A at the membrane of cells from colon carcinomas or brain tumors.

10716726|t|Large exons encoding multiple ectodomains are a characteristic feature of protocadherin genes.
10716726|a|Recent studies revealed a striking difference in the genomic organization of classic cadherin genes and one family of "nonclassic cadherin" genes designated protocadherins. Specifically, the DNA sequences encoding the ectodomain repeats of classic cadherins are interrupted by multiple introns. By contrast, all of the encoded ectodomains of each member of the protocadherin gene clusters are present in one large exon. To determine whether large ectodomain exons are a general feature of protocadherin genes we have investigated the genomic organization of several additional human protocadherin genes by using DNA sequence information in GenBank. These genes include protocadherin 12 (Pcdh12), an ortholog of the mouse vascular endothelial cadherin-2 gene; hFmi1 and hFmi2, homologs of the Drosophila planar cell polarity gene, flamingo; hFat2, a homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene fat; and the Drosophila DN-cadherin and DE-cadherin genes. Each of these genes was found to be a member of the protocadherin subfamily, based on amino acid sequence comparisons of their ectodomains. Remarkably, all of these protocadherin genes share a common feature: most of the genomic DNA sequences encoding their ectodomains are not interrupted by an intron. We conclude that the presence of unusually large exons is a characteristic feature of protocadherin genes.

10729163|t|Induction of a novel cellular homolog of interleukin-10, AK155, by transformation of T lymphocytes with herpesvirus saimiri.
10729163|a|Although herpesvirus saimiri-transformed T lymphocytes retain multiple normal T-cell functions, only a few changes have been described. By subtractive hybridization, we have isolated a novel cellular gene, ak155, a sequence homolog of the interleukin-10 gene. Specifically herpesvirus saimiri-transformed T cells overexpress ak155 and secrete the protein into the supernatant. In other T-cell lines and in native peripheral blood cells, but not in B cells, ak155 is transcribed at low levels. AK155 forms homodimers similarly to interleukin-10. As a lymphokine, AK155 may contribute to the transformed phenotype of human T cells after infection by herpesvirus saimiri.

10747949|t|A novel mammalian iron-regulated protein involved in intracellular iron metabolism.
10747949|a|We have isolated and characterized a novel iron-regulated gene that is homologous to the divalent metal transporter 1 family of metal transporters. This gene, termed metal transporter protein (mtp1), is expressed in tissues involved in body iron homeostasis including the developing and mature reticuloendothelial system, the duodenum, and the pregnant uterus. MTP1 is also expressed in muscle and central nervous system cells in the embryo. At the subcellular level, MTP1 is localized to the basolateral membrane of the duodenal epithelial cell and a cytoplasmic compartment of reticuloendothelial system cells. Overexpression of MTP1 in tissue culture cells results in intracellular iron depletion. In the adult mouse, MTP1 expression in the liver and duodenum are reciprocally regulated. Iron deficiency induces MTP1 expression in the duodenum but down-regulates expression in the liver. These data indicate that MTP1 is an iron-regulated membrane-spanning protein that is involved in intracellular iron metabolism.

10747952|t|Cloning and expression of the histo-blood group Pk UDP-galactose: Ga1beta-4G1cbeta1-cer alpha1, 4-galactosyltransferase. Molecular genetic basis of the p phenotype.
10747952|a|The molecular genetic basis of the P histo-blood group system has eluded characterization despite extensive studies of the biosynthesis of the P(1), P, and P(k) glycolipids. The main controversy has been whether a single or two distinct UDP-Gal:Galbeta1-R 4-alpha-galactosyltransferases catalyze the syntheses of the structurally related P(1) and P(k) antigens. The P(1) polymorphism is linked to 22q11.3-ter. Data base searches with the coding region of an alpha4GlcNAc-transferase identified a novel homologous gene at 22q13.2 designated alpha4Gal-T1. Expression of full coding constructs of alpha4Gal-T1 in insect cells revealed it encoded P(k) but not P(1) synthase activity. Northern analysis showed expression of the transcript correlating with P(k) synthase activity and antigen expression in human B cell lines. Transfection of P(k)-negative Namalwa cells with alpha4Gal-T1 resulted in strong P(k) expression. A single homozygous missense mutation, M183K, was found in six Swedish individuals of the rare p phenotype, confirming that alpha4Gal-T1 represented the P(k) gene. Sequence analysis of the coding region of alpha4Gal-T1 in P(1)+/- individuals did not reveal polymorphisms correlating with P(1)P(2) typing.

10748049|t|Characterization of ABCB9, an ATP binding cassette protein associated with lysosomes.
10748049|a|We have cloned full-length human and mouse cDNAs of ABCB9, which encodes a predicted multiple-spanning transmembrane domain and a nucleotide-binding domain with Walker motifs. It is therefore designated as a "half" ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Northern analysis shows that the ABCB9 mRNA is expressed at a high level in testes and moderate levels in brain and spinal cord. A splice variant mRNA deleted in the last pair of predicted transmembrane segments was shown to be expressed in human tissues. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that ABCB9 is closely related to TAP1 and TAP2, two "half" ABC proteins found in endoplasmic reticulum. ABCB9 protein colocalized with the lysosomal markers, LAMP1 and LAMP2, in transfected cells. ABCB9 protein appears to be most highly expressed in the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules in mouse and rat testes. These cells have high levels of phagocytosis and secretory activities. These findings pave the way for further investigation into the potential novel function of ABCB9 in lysosomes.

10748143|t|Molecular cloning of globotriaosylceramide/CD77 synthase, a glycosyltransferase that initiates the synthesis of globo series glycosphingolipids.
10748143|a|The expression cloning of a cDNA for globotriaosylceramide (Gb3)/CD77 synthase (alpha1,4-galactosyltransferase) was achieved using an anti-Gb3 antibody and mouse L cells as a recipient cell line for the transfection. The isolated cDNA clone designated pVTR1 predicted a type II membrane protein with 19 amino acids of cytoplasmic domain, 26 amino acids of transmembrane region, and a catalytic domain with 308 amino acids. Introduction of the cDNA clone into L cells resulted in the neosynthesis of Gb3/CD77, and the extracts of the transfectant cells showed alpha1, 4-galactosyltransferase activity only on lactosylceramide and galactosylceramide. In Northern blotting, a 2.3-kilobase mRNA was strongly expressed in heart, kidney, spleen, and placenta and weakly in colon, small intestine, and brain. Transfection of the cDNA into L cells resulted in the constitution of sensitivity to the apoptosis with Shiga-like toxins (verotoxins). Since Gb3/CD77 synthase initiates the synthesis of globo series glycolipids, the isolation of this cDNA will make possible further investigations into the function of its important series of glycolipids.

10751307|t|Identification of a fourth subunit of mammalian DNA polymerase delta.
10751307|a|A 12-kDa and two 25-kDa polypeptides were isolated with highly purified calf thymus DNA polymerase delta by conventional chromatography. A 16-mer peptide sequence was obtained from the 12-kDa polypeptide which matched a new open reading frame from a human EST () encoding a hypothetical protein of unknown function. The protein was designated as p12. Human EST was identified as the putative human homologue of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdm1 by a tBlastn search of the EST data base using S. pombe Cdm1. The open reading frame of human EST encoded a polypeptide of 107 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 12.4 kDa, consistent with the experimental findings. p12 is 25% identical to S pombe Cdm1. Both of the 25-kDa polypeptide sequences matched the hypothetical KIAA0039 protein sequence, recently identified as the third subunit of pol delta. Western blotting of immunoaffinity purified calf thymus pol delta revealed the presence of p125, p50, p68 (the KIAA0039 product), and p12. With the identification of p12 mammalian pol delta can now be shown to consist of four subunits. These studies pave the way for more detailed analysis of the possible functions of the mammalian subunits of pol delta.

10766186|t|LRP-DIT, a putative endocytic receptor gene, is frequently inactivated in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.
10766186|a|A variety of studies suggest that allelic losses at chromosome 2q are associated with aggressive behavior of various forms of human neoplasia. Using a probe to detect homozygous deletions on chromosome 2q21.2 in kidney and bladder cancer cell lines, we identified a new candidate tumor suppressor gene, lipoprotein receptor-related protein-deleted in tumors (LRP-DIT). The predicted LRP-DIT product of 4599 amino acids has extensive homology to a gigantic receptor, LRP1, which mediates endocytosis of multiple proteins from the cell surface. Homozygous deletions in LRP-DIT were detected in 17% (4 of 23) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The expression of only abnormal transcripts missing portions of the LRP-DIT sequence was demonstrated in an additional 30% (11 of 36) of NSCLC lines. Finally, a missense mutation at codon 3157 was detected in one of four NSCLC lines tested for the large open reading frame. In contrast, no LRP-DIT alterations were identified in a major fraction of SCLC cell lines, indicating that this gene is preferentially inactivated in one histological type of lung cancer. Our data suggest that inactivation of LRP-DIT occurs in at least 40% of NSCLC lines and thus may play an important role in tumorigenesis of NSCLCs.

10766764|t|Cloning and functional expression of two families of beta-subunits of the large conductance calcium-activated K+ channel.
10766764|a|We report here a characterization of two families of calcium-activated K(+) channel beta-subunits, beta2 and beta3, which are encoded by distinct genes that map to 3q26.2-27. A single beta2 family member and four alternatively spliced variants of beta3 were investigated. These subunits have predicted molecular masses of 27. 1-31.6 kDa, share approximately 30-44% amino acid identity with beta1, and exhibit distinct but overlapping expression patterns. Coexpression of the beta2 or beta3a-c subunits with a BK alpha-subunit altered the functional properties of the current expressed by the alpha-subunit alone. The beta2 subunit rapidly and completely inactivated the current and shifted the voltage dependence for activation to more polarized membrane potentials. In contrast, coexpression of the beta3a-c subunits resulted in only partial inactivation of the current, and the beta3b subunit conferred an apparent inward rectification. Furthermore, unlike the beta1 and beta2 subunits, none of the beta3 subunits increased channel sensitivity to calcium or voltage. The tissue-specific expression of these beta-subunits may allow for the assembly of a large number of distinct BK channels in vivo, contributing to the functional diversity of native BK currents.

10767544|t|Cloning of CCRL1, an orphan seven transmembrane receptor related to chemokine receptors, expressed abundantly in the heart.
10767544|a|In an attempt to identify novel chemokine receptor genes, cDNA expressed sequence tags (EST) were analyzed for a significant homology with mammalian chemokine receptors. The sequence from one of the selected EST clones was used to generate a full-length cDNA encoding a putative seven transmembrane receptor, CCRL1-CC chemokine receptor like 1. The full-length receptor encodes a polypeptide of 350 amino acids and has about 35% homology to the chemokine receptors CCR6 and CCR7. Northern blot analysis indicates predominant expression of about 5.0, 2.0 and 1.3kb mRNA forms in human heart tissue, while low-level expression of the 2.0 and 1.3kb forms was observed in lung, pancreas and spleen and in fetal tissues. In-situ hybridization confirmed the presence of CCRL1 mRNA in cardiac muscle cells. Similar to the chemokine receptor CCR6, CCRL1 maps to chromosome 6 and has one intron in the 5' untranslated region. Coupled transcription-translation of CCRL1 cDNA yielded a glycosylated polypeptide of about 45kDa.

10779507|t|Localization and genomic organization of a new hepatocellular organic anion transporting polypeptide.
10779507|a|Based on sequence homology to the human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (OATP2; SLC21A6), we cloned a new member of the SLC21A superfamily of solute carriers, termed OATP8 (SLC21A8). The protein of 702 amino acids showed an amino acid identity of 80% with human OATP2. Based on Northern blotting, the expression of OATP8 was restricted to human liver. Cosmid clones containing the genes encoding human OATP1 (SLC21A3), OATP2 (SLC21A6), and OATP8 (SLC21A8) served to establish their genomic organization. All three genes contained 14 exons with 13 identical splice sites when transferred to the amino acid sequence. An antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus localized OATP8 to the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes and the recombinant glycoprotein, expressed in MDCKII cells, to the lateral membrane. Transport properties of OATP8 were studied in stably transfected MDCKII and HEK293 cells. Organic anions transported by human OATP8 included sulfobromophthalein, with a K(m) of 3.3 microm, and 17beta-glucuronosyl estradiol, with a K(m) of 5.4 microm. Several bile salts were not substrates. Thus, human OATP8 is a new uptake transporter in the basolateral hepatocyte membrane with an overlapping but distinct substrate specificity as compared with OATP2, which is localized to the same membrane domain.

10780674|t|AAC-11 overexpression induces invasion and protects cervical cancer cells from apoptosis.
10780674|a|To identify the genes involved in cervical carcinogenesis, we applied the mRNA differential display (DD) method to analyze normal cervical tissue, cervical cancer, metastatic lymph node, and cervical cancer cell line. We cloned a 491-bp cDNA fragment, CC231, which was present in metastatic tissue and cervical cancer cell line, but absent in normal cervical and cervical cancer tissues. The 491 bp cDNA fragment has 98% homology to the previously published sequence, AAC-11 (antiapoptosis clone 11). The levels of AAC-11 mRNA expressions in nine normal cervical and nine primary cervical cancer tissues were low. Its expression was higher in three metastatic tissues and five cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, CaSki, SiHa, CUMC-3, and CUMC-6). Invasion of matrigel and adhesion to laminin by AAC-11 transfected CUMC-6 cells were increased by approximately 2-fold and 4-fold, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) genes were found to be expressed in high levels in AAC-11-transfected cancer cells. But MMP-2 and MT1-MMP were not expressed in cells transfected with vector alone or wild-type cells. AAC-11-transfected cells expressed an elevated level of MMP-2 protein as assessed by immunoblotting. On the contrary, tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP-2) expression was detectable in cells transfected with vector alone or wild-type cells, respectively. Its expression was undetectable in AAC-11 transfected cells. In cervical cancer cells transfected with AAC-11, the expression of beta-catenin was up-regulated. These suggest that overexpressions of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, loss of TIMP-2 expression, and up-regulation of beta-catenin by AAC-11 transfection may contribute to the development of cervical cancer invasion. AAC-11 gene transfection increased cervical cancer cell colonization. The effect of AAC-11 on cultured cervical cancer cells was associated with antiapoptotic process. Approximately 50% of the AAC-11 transfected cells in serum-free medium died after 2 weeks, compared to 1 week for vector alone or wild-type cells. These results suggest that AAC-11 may serve as a candidate metastasis-related and apoptosis-inhibiting gene in human cervical cancer.

10799322|t|Cloning, characterization, and expression of the human TIN-ag-RP gene encoding a novel putative extracellular matrix protein.
10799322|a|The human gene encoding a novel tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen (TIN-ag)-related protein (TIN-ag-RP) was isolated, and its genomic organization was determined. BLAST searches revealed the highest degree of homology to several mammalian TIN-ag orthologues, and a weak homology to cathepsin B-like proteases. The 12 kb gene was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization to chromosome 1p34.2-3, a locus neither related to that of the human TIN-ag (6p11.2-12) nor to that of cathepsin B (8p22-23.1). The TIN-ag-RP is encoded in ten exons with introns ranging from 83 bp to 4 kb. In addition, the gene contained one exon in the 5'UTR, but none in the 3'UTR. Five of the 10 splice sites of the TIN-ag-RP gene were fully conserved when compared to a related gene of C. elegans, whereas only one splice site was identical to those found in cathepsin B genes. Furthermore, human TIN-ag-RP tagged with the T7-epitope, was expressed in HeLa cells, and was found to be localized in vesicular compartments as well as secreted into the medium suggesting the involvement of the endosomal trafficking pathway. Based on the high degree of homology of the amino acid sequences and genomic organization between TIN-ag-RP and TIN-ag, we suggest that both molecules may form a distinct group or family of TIN-ag-like proteins.

10828014|t|Identification and characterization of a new human ETS-family transcription factor, TEL2, that is expressed in hematopoietic tissues and can associate with TEL1/ETV6.
10828014|a|The ETS family of proteins is a large group of transcription factors implicated in many aspects of normal hematopoietic development, as well as oncogenesis. For example, the TEL1/ETV6 (TEL1) gene is required for normal yolk sac angiogenesis, adult bone marrow hematopoiesis, and is rearranged or deleted in numerous leukemias. This report describes the cloning and characterization of a novel ETS gene that is highly related to TEL1 and is therefore called TEL2. The TEL2 gene consists of 8 exons spanning approximately 21 kilobases (kb) in human chromosome 6p21. Unlike the ubiquitously expressed TEL1 gene, however, TEL2 appears to be expressed predominantly in hematopoietic tissues. Antibodies raised against the C-terminus of the TEL2 protein were used to show that TEL2 localizes to the nucleus. All ETS proteins can bind DNA via the highly conserved ETS domain, which recognizes a purine-rich DNA sequence with a GGAA core motif. DNA binding assays show that TEL2 can bind the same consensus DNA binding sequence recognized by TEL1/ETV6. Additionally, the TEL2 protein is capable of associating with itself and with TEL1 in doubly transfected Hela cells, and this interaction is mediated through the pointed (PNT) domain of TEL1. The striking similarities of TEL2 to the oncogenic TEL1, its expression in hematopoietic tissues, and its ability to associate with TEL1 suggest that TEL2 may be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein.

10831842|t|Molecular cloning, chromosome mapping and characterization of UBQLN3 a testis-specific gene that contains an ubiquitin-like domain.
10831842|a|The sequence of the ubiquitin protein is highly conserved between species and has facilitated the cloning of numerous ubiquitin-like proteins. In the present study, we report the cloning of the cDNA for human ubiquilin 3 (UBQLN3). The deduced amino acid sequence of UBQLN3 contains a UBQ domain (ubiquitin-like) in the amino terminus as well as two highly conserved domains found in several recently cloned ubiquitin-like proteins. One of these domains, termed the NP domain, is a highly conserved 93 amino acid region present in UBQLN3 and several ubiquitin-like proteins. The last conserved domain is the UBA domain (ubiquitin-associated) found in a variety of proteins of the ubiquination pathway. The human UBQLN3 gene was mapped to the 11p15 region of chromosome 11. Northern blot analysis of multiple human and mouse tissues demonstrated UBQLN3 mRNA expression specifically in testis.

10854325|t|Tollip, a new component of the IL-1RI pathway, links IRAK to the IL-1 receptor.
10854325|a|Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a proinflammatory cytokine that elicits its pleiotropic effects through activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1. Binding of IL-1 to its receptor results in rapid assembly of a membrane-proximal signalling complex that consists of two different receptor chains (IL-1Rs), IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP, the adaptor protein MyD88, the serine/threonine kinase IRAK and a new protein, which we have named Tollip. Here we show that, before IL-1beta treatment, Tollip is present in a complex with IRAK, and that recruitment of Tollip-IRAK complexes to the activated receptor complex occurs through association of Tollip with IL-1RAcP. Co-recruited MyD88 then triggers IRAK autophosphorylation, which in turn leads to rapid dissociation of IRAK from Tollip (and IL-1Rs). As overexpression of Tollip results in impaired NF-kappaB activation, we conclude that Tollip is an important constituent of the IL-1R signalling pathway.

10866201|t|Excessive placental secretion of neurokinin B during the third trimester causes pre-eclampsia.
10866201|a|Pre-eclampsia is a principal cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, affecting 5-10% of first pregnancies worldwide. Manifestations include increased blood pressure, proteinuria, coagulopathy and peripheral and cerebral oedema. Although the aetiology and pathogenesis remain to be elucidated, the placenta is undoubtedly involved, as termination of pregnancy eradicates the disease. Here we have cloned a complementary DNA from human placental messenger RNA encoding a precursor protein of 121 amino acids which gives rise to a mature peptide identical to the neuropeptide neurokinin B (NKB) of other mammalian species. In female rats, concentrations of NKB several-fold above that of an animal 20 days into pregnancy caused substantial pressor activity. In human pregnancy, the expression of NKB was confined to the outer syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta, significant concentrations of NKB could be detected in plasma as early as week 9, and plasma concentrations of NKB were grossly elevated in pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. We conclude that elevated levels of NKB in early pregnancy may be an indicator of hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and that treatment with certain neurokinin receptor antagonists may be useful in alleviating the symptoms.

10866301|t|Genomic structure of the human ING1 gene and tumor-specific mutations detected in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
10866301|a|We characterized the genomic structure of the human ING1 gene, a candidate tumor suppressor gene, and found that the gene has three exons. We also demonstrated that four mRNA variants were transcribed from three different promoter regions. Of 34 informative cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, 68% of tumors showed loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 13q33-34, where the ING1 gene is located. Here we present the first report that three missense mutations and three silent changes were detected in the ING1 gene in 6 of 23 tumors with allelic loss at the 13q33-34 region. These missense mutations were found within the PHD finger domain and nuclear localization motif in ING1 protein, probably abrogating the normal function.

10882522|t|Isolation and characterization of the novel popeye gene family expressed in skeletal muscle and heart.
10882522|a|We identified a novel gene family in vertebrates which is preferentially expressed in developing and adult striated muscle. Three genes of the Popeye (POP) family were detected in human and mouse and two in chicken. Chromosomal mapping indicates that Pop1 and Pop3 genes are clustered on mouse chromosome 10, whereas Pop2 maps to mouse chromosome 16. We found evidence that POP1 and POP3 in chicken may also be linked and multiple transcript isoforms are generated from this locus. The POP genes encode proteins with three potential transmembrane domains that are conserved in all family members. Individual POP genes exhibit specific expression patterns during development and postnatally. Chicken POP3 and mouse Pop1 are first preferentially expressed in atrium and later also in the subepicardial compact layer of the ventricles. Chicken POP1 and mouse Pop2 are expressed in the entire heart except the outflow tract. All three Pop genes are expressed in heart and skeletal muscle of the adult mouse and lower in lung. Pop1 and Pop2 expression is upregulated in uterus of pregnant mice. Like the mouse genes, human POP genes are predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The strong conservation of POP genes during evolution and their preferential expression in heart and skeletal muscle suggest that these novel proteins may have an important function in these tissues in vertebrates.

10882741|t|Identification, cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the testis-specific RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL3.
10882741|a|The human ELL gene, which is a frequent target for translocation in acute myeloid leukemia, was initially isolated from rat liver nuclei and found to be an RNA polymerase II elongation factor. Based on homology to ELL, we later cloned ELL2 and demonstrated that it can also increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. To better understand the role of ELL proteins in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, we have initiated a search for proteins related to ELLs. In this report, we describe the molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of ELL3, a novel RNA polymerase II elongation factor approximately 50% similar to both ELL and ELL2. Our transcriptional studies have demonstrated that ELL3 can also increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. The C-terminal domain of ELL, which we recently demonstrated to be required and sufficient for the immortalization of myeloid progenitor cells, shares strong similarities to the C-terminal domain of ELL3. ELL3 was localized by immunofluorescence to the nucleus of cells, and Northern analysis indicated that ELL3 is a testis-specific RNA polymerase II elongation factor.

10888605|t|The SCA8 transcript is an antisense RNA to a brain-specific transcript encoding a novel actin-binding protein (KLHL1).
10888605|a|Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat that is transcribed as part of an untranslated RNA. As a step towards understanding the molecular pathology of SCA8, we have defined the genomic organization of the SCA8 RNA transcripts and assembled a 166 kb segment of genomic sequence containing the repeat. The most striking feature of the SCA8 transcripts is that the most 5' exon is transcribed through the first exon of another gene that is transcribed in the opposite orientation. This gene arrangement suggests that the SCA8 transcript is an endogenous antisense RNA that overlaps the transcription and translation start sites as well as the first splice donor sequence of the sense gene. The sense transcript encodes a 748 amino acid protein with a predicted domain structure typical of a family of actin-organizing proteins related to the Drosophila Kelch gene, and so has been given the name Kelch-like 1 (KLHL1). We have identified the full-length cDNA sequence for both the human and mouse KLHLI genes, and have elucidated the general genomic organization of the human gene. The predicted open reading frame and promoter region are highly conserved, and both genes are primarily expressed in specific brain tissues, including the cerebellum, the tissue most affected by SCA8. Transfection studies with epitope-tagged KLHL1 demonstrate that the protein localizes to the cytoplasm, suggesting that it may play a role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton of the brain cells in which it is expressed.

10888872|t|DNMT1 binds HDAC2 and a new co-repressor, DMAP1, to form a complex at replication foci.
10888872|a|DNA methylation can contribute to transcriptional silencing through several transcriptionally repressive complexes, which include methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). We show here that the chief enzyme that maintains mammalian DNA methylation, DNMT1, can also establish a repressive transcription complex. The non-catalytic amino terminus of DNMT1 binds to HDAC2 and a new protein, DMAP1 (for DNMT1 associated protein), and can mediate transcriptional repression. DMAP1 has intrinsic transcription repressive activity, and binds to the transcriptional co-repressor TSG101. DMAP1 is targeted to replication foci through interaction with the far N terminus of DNMT1 throughout S phase, whereas HDAC2 joins DNMT1 and DMAP1 only during late S phase, providing a platform for how histones may become deacetylated in heterochromatin following replication. Thus, DNMT1 not only maintains DNA methylation, but also may directly target, in a heritable manner, transcriptionally repressive chromatin to the genome during DNA replication.

10913340|t|Molecular cloning and characterization of human FGF-20 on chromosome 8p21.3-p22.
10913340|a|The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play important roles in morphogenesis, angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and carcinogenesis. Human FGF-20 has been cloned and characterized in this study. FGF-20 encodes a 211-amino-acid polypeptide with the FGF-core domain. A strong hydrophobic region was found in the FGF-core domain of FGF-20; however, no typical N-terminal signal sequence was found in FGF-20, just as in FGF-9 and FGF-16. Total amino acid identities are as follows: FGF-20 vs FGF-9, 71.6%; FGF-20 vs FGF-16, 66.2%; FGF-9 vs FGF-16, 72.4%. Phylogenic analysis indicated that FGF-20, FGF-9, and FGF-16 constitute a subfamily among the FGF family. FGF-20 mRNA of 2.4 kb in size was detected in colon cancer cell line SW480 by Northern blot analysis. Lower levels of FGF-20 mRNA were detected in human fetal tissues and primary cancers by cDNA-PCR. The nucleotide sequence of FGF-20 cDNA is split into three parts in the human genome sequence of the chromosome 8p21.3-p22 region (Accession No. AB020858). These results indicate that the FGF-20 gene, located on human chromosome 8p21.3-p22, consists of three exons. Compared with the nucleotide sequence of FGF-20 cDNA determined in this study, one nucleotide deletion and one nucleotide substitution in the putative coding region were identified in human genome sequence AB020858.

10913346|t|Cloning and characterization of cDNA encoding a novel human leukotriene B(4) receptor.
10913346|a|By homology screening using BLAST searches of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we have found a previously unidentified cDNA encoding a putative seven-transmembrane receptor with highest similarity to the leukotriene B(4) receptor, BLTR. Analysis of calcium flow in transfected cells, along with sequence analysis, revealed that the EST encoded a functionally inactive protein, lacking the segment corresponding to the C-terminal part of the putative receptor protein. The missing segment was obtained by PCR amplification of a human leukocyte cDNA library and ligated to the truncated EST cDNA. The novel cDNA encodes a full-length receptor with 39% identity to the previously cloned BLTR. Studies of intracellular calcium flow of transfected HeLa cells exposed to various leukotrienes showed that also the novel BLTR-like receptor can be activated by leukotriene B(4), and it is therefore tentatively named BLTR2.

10924333|t|The cysteine- and glycine-rich LIM domain protein CRP2 specifically interacts with a novel human protein (CRP2BP).
10924333|a|We used the interaction trap to isolate a novel human protein that specifically interacts with the double LIM domain protein CRP2. This protein, designated CRP2BP (for CRP2 binding partner), was previously postulated by sequencing contigs of human chromosome 20. The observed interaction is mediated via the LIM1 domain of CRP2 and is of functional relevance in cellular environment. This novel single copy gene spans approximately 45-bp and is organized into at least ten exons. CRP2BP is expressed in all human tissues tested, with a major mRNA of 4-kb in size and an additional 3.2-kb transcript in placenta.   Copyright 2000 Academic Press.

10936056|t|Cloning and characterization of human DDX24 and mouse Ddx24, two novel putative DEAD-Box proteins, and mapping DDX24 to human chromosome 14q32.
10936056|a|DEAD-box proteins are a large group of putative RNA helicases that exist ubiquitously in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. They are likely to play important roles in many different RNA metabolic processes. In this paper, we report the cloning of human DDX24, a putative DEAD-box protein, and its ortholog, Ddx24 in mouse. The deduced proteins encoded by these two cDNAs share 78.7% identity at the amino acid level and possess all the well-conserved motifs of DEAD-box proteins. However, little homology can be found between them and other DEAD-box proteins, even in their core region (identity <40%). Northern blot analysis showed that a 3.0-kb transcript of human DDX24 exists ubiquitously in the 16 human tissues examined and was most abundant in heart and brain, but with lowest levels in thymus and small intestine. The mouse Ddx24, whose transcript is 4.0 kb, was also expressed widely in 10 tissues tested with the highest level in heart and testis. By radiation hybrid mapping, the human DDX24 gene was localized to human chromosome 14q32 between the markers D14S81 and D14S265. Moreover, the gene structure of DDX24 was determined by comparing its cDNA and genomic sequence from BAC R-1089B7, which showed that the gene spanned a 30-kb region and consisted of at least nine exons.

10938276|t|A human gene coding for a membrane-associated nucleic acid-binding protein.
10938276|a|Studies to clone a cell-surface DNA-binding protein involved in the binding and internalization of extracellular DNA have led to the isolation of a gene for a membrane-associated nucleic acid-binding protein (MNAB). The full-length cDNA is 4.3 kilobases with an open reading frame of 3576 base pairs encoding a protein of approximately 130 kDa (GenBank accession numbers and ). The MNAB gene is on human chromosome 9 with wide expression in normal tissues and tumor cells. A C3HC4 RING finger and a CCCH zinc finger have been identified in the amino-terminal half of the protein. MNAB bound DNA (K(D) approximately 4 nm) and mutagenesis of a single conserved amino acid in the zinc finger reduced DNA binding by 50%. A potential transmembrane domain exists near the carboxyl terminus. Antibodies against the amino-terminal half of the protein immunoprecipitated a protein of molecular mass approximately 150 kDa and reacted with cell surfaces. The MNAB protein is membrane-associated and primarily localized to the perinuclear space, probably to the endoplasmic reticulum or trans-Golgi network. Characterization of the MNAB protein as a cell-surface DNA-binding protein, critical in binding and internalization of extracellular DNA, awaits confirmation of its localization to cell surfaces.

10944437|t|Cloning, genomic organization, and tissue distribution of human Ssf-1.
10944437|a|During the screening of a human placenta cDNA library, realized in order to isolate the P2Y(11) coding sequence, an unrelated cDNA was cloned. We identified a 1422 bp open reading frame encoding a human protein displaying 40% amino acid identity with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ssf-1, a protein involved in the second step of mRNA splicing. Sequencing of the corresponding genomic DNA showed that the gene encoding human Ssf-1 is located upstream to the P2Y(11) gene on chromosome 19p31. Comparison of the cDNA and genomic DNA sequences revealed that the human Ssf-1 gene is split into 12 exons. Northern blotting experiments showed that the 1.7 kb Ssf-1 mRNA presents an ubiquitous tissue expression. We also show that, in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, Ssf-1 mRNA is rapidly upregulated following a treatment by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and dibutyryl-cyclicAMP, two agents known to induce the granulocytic differentiation of these cells.

10944529|t|XAB2, a novel tetratricopeptide repeat protein involved in transcription-coupled DNA repair and transcription.
10944529|a|Nucleotide excision repair is a highly versatile DNA repair system responsible for elimination of a wide variety of lesions from the genome. It is comprised of two subpathways: transcription-coupled repair that accomplishes efficient removal of damage blocking transcription and global genome repair. Recently, the basic mechanism of global genome repair has emerged from biochemical studies. However, little is known about transcription-coupled repair in eukaryotes. Here we report the identification of a novel protein designated XAB2 (XPA-binding protein 2) that was identified by virtue of its ability to interact with XPA, a factor central to both nucleotide excision repair subpathways. The XAB2 protein of 855 amino acids consists mainly of 15 tetratricopeptide repeats. In addition to interacting with XPA, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that a fraction of XAB2 is able to interact with the transcription-coupled repair-specific proteins CSA and CSB as well as RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, antibodies against XAB2 inhibited both transcription-coupled repair and transcription in vivo but not global genome repair when microinjected into living fibroblasts. These results indicate that XAB2 is a novel component involved in transcription-coupled repair and transcription.

10949293|t|Regulation of chromatin structure by site-specific histone H3 methyltransferases.
10949293|a|The organization of chromatin into higher-order structures influences chromosome function and epigenetic gene regulation. Higher-order chromatin has been proposed to be nucleated by the covalent modification of histone tails and the subsequent establishment of chromosomal subdomains by non-histone modifier factors. Here we show that human SUV39H1 and murine Suv39h1--mammalian homologues of Drosophila Su(var)3-9 and of Schizosaccharomyces pombe clr4--encode histone H3-specific methyltransferases that selectively methylate lysine 9 of the amino terminus of histone H3 in vitro. We mapped the catalytic motif to the evolutionarily conserved SET domain, which requires adjacent cysteine-rich regions to confer histone methyltransferase activity. Methylation of lysine 9 interferes with phosphorylation of serine 10, but is also influenced by pre-existing modifications in the amino terminus of H3. In vivo, deregulated SUV39H1 or disrupted Suv39h activity modulate H3 serine 10 phosphorylation in native chromatin and induce aberrant mitotic divisions. Our data reveal a functional interdependence of site-specific H3 tail modifications and suggest a dynamic mechanism for the regulation of higher-order chromatin.

We have isolated the human orthologue of mouse AID cDNA, which has an open reading frame of 198 residues containing a conserved cytidine deaminase motif. The amino acid sequence of human AID is 92% identical to that of mouse AID. RT-PCR analysis of 15 human tissues showed that AID mRNA is expressed strongly in lymph nodes and tonsils.

10954742|t|Human interleukin-10-related T cell-derived inducible factor: molecular cloning and functional characterization as an hepatocyte-stimulating factor.
10954742|a|IL-10-related T cell-derived inducible factor (IL-TIF or IL-21) is a new cytokine structurally related to IL-10 and originally identified in the mouse as a gene induced by IL-9 in T cells and mast cells. Here, we report the cloning of the human IL-TIF cDNA, which shares 79% amino acid identity with mouse IL-TIF and 25% identity with human IL-10. Recombinant human IL-TIF was found to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription factors-1 and -3 in several hepatoma cell lines. IL-TIF stimulation of HepG2 human hepatoma cells up-regulated the production of acute phase reactants such as serum amyloid A, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and haptoglobin. Although IL-10 and IL-TIF have distinct activities, antibodies directed against the beta chain of the IL-10 receptor blocked the induction of acute phase reactants by IL-TIF, indicating that this chain is a common component of the IL-10 and IL-TIF receptors. Similar acute phase reactant induction was observed in mouse liver upon IL-TIF injection, and IL-TIF expression was found to be rapidly increased after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, suggesting that this cytokine contributes to the inflammatory response in vivo.

10967094|t|Characterization of TCL, a new GTPase of the rho family related to TC10 andCcdc42.
10967094|a|GTPases of the Rho family control a wide variety of cellular processes such as cell morphology, motility, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We report here the characterization of a new Rho member, which shares 85% and 78% amino acid similarity to TC10 and Cdc42, respectively. This GTPase, termed as TC10-like (TCL) is encoded by an unexpectedly large locus, made of five exons spanning over 85 kilobases on human chromosome 14. TCL mRNA is 2.5 kilobases long and is mainly expressed in heart. In vitro, TCL shows rapid GDP/GTP exchange and displays higher GTP dissociation and hydolysis rates than TC10. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and GST pull-down assays, we show that GTP-bound but not GDP-bound TCL protein directly interacts with Cdc42/Rac interacting binding domains, such as those found in PAK and WASP. Despite its overall similarity to TC10 and Cdc42, the constitutively active TCL mutant displays distinct morphogenic activity in REF-52 fibroblasts, producing large and dynamic F-actin-rich ruffles on the dorsal cell membrane. Interestingly, TCL morphogenic activity is blocked by dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42 mutants, suggesting a cross-talk between these three Rho GTPases.

10967134|t|Complete nucleotide sequence and genomic structure of the human NRAMP1 gene region on chromosome region 2q35.
10967134|a|Several lines of independent evidence suggest that human Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein 1 gene (NRAMP1) is an important regulator of susceptibility to infectious diseases caused by certain intracellular pathogens. Here, we report the nucleotide sequence of 32198 bp of genomic DNA overlapping NRAMP1 on chromosomal region 2q35. The NRAMP1 gene spans 13604 bp. The gene and its 5' genomic region are highly enriched for DNA repeat sequences. A second gene was identified in the immediate vicinity of NRAMP1 and was tentatively named Nuclear LIM Interactor-Interacting Factor (NLI-IF) by analogy to its closest ortholog. The human NLI-IF gene begins 4721 bp downstream of the NRAMP1 stop codon and is composed of seven exons varying in size from 57 bp to 1644 bp. The gene gives rise to a 2655-bp mRNA transcript that contains a 783-bp open reading frame. The predicted molecular weight of the 261-amino acid NLI-IF protein is 29.2 kDa. Several putative gene regulatory elements were identified in the 5' upstream region of NLI-IF, including consensus binding sequences for Sp1, AP-2, NF-kappa B, and PU 1. The NLI-IF amino acid sequence has homology to proteins that have a high degree of homology with the NLI-interacting factor from Gallus gallus and are found in divergent species ranging from yeast to plants. NLI-IF is part of a human gene family encoding four related proteins of unknown function. Northern blot analysis of 15 different human tissues revealed a 2.6-kb NLI-IF mRNA that was ubiquitously expressed, but at varying levels. A second transcript with estimated size of 7 kb was expressed only in the placenta. Our data provide new sequence information about the NRAMP1 gene region that will be useful in the search for genetic variants causally involved in altered susceptibility to infectious diseases.

10967136|t|The WFDC1 gene encoding ps20 localizes to 16q24, a region of LOH in multiple cancers.
10967136|a|We previously identified ps20 protein as a secreted growth inhibitor and purified the protein from fetal rat prostate urogenital sinus mesenchymal cell conditioned medium. The rat cDNA was subsequently cloned, and ps20 was found to contain a WAP-type four-disulfide core motif, indicating it may function as a protease inhibitor. We now report cloning and characterization of the mouse ps20 gene (designated Wfdc1), the human homolog cDNA, and the human gene (designated WFDC1). Both the mouse and human WFDC1 genes consist of seven exons and encode respective ps20 proteins sharing 79.1% identity and nearly identical WAP motifs in exon 2. The WFDC1 gene was mapped by FISH analysis to human Chromosome (Chr) 16q24, an area of frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) previously identified in multiple cancers including prostate, breast, hepatocellular, and Wilms' tumor. Identification and characterization of the WFDC1 gene may aid in better understanding the potential role of this gene and ps20 in prostate biology and carcinogenesis.

10973974|t|Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel type of histamine receptor preferentially expressed in leukocytes.
10973974|a|Recently cDNA encoding the histamine H3 receptor was isolated after 15 years of considerable research. However, several studies have proposed heterogeneity of the H3 receptor. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel type of histamine receptor. A novel orphan G-protein-coupled receptor named GPRv53 was obtained through a search of the human genomic DNA data base and analyzed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). GPRv53 possessed the features of biologic amine receptors and had the highest homology with H3 receptor among known G-protein-coupled receptors. Mammalian cells expressing GPRv53 were demonstrated to bind and respond to histamine in a concentration-dependent manner. In functional assays, not only an H3 receptor agonist, R-(alpha)-methylhistamine, but also a H3 receptor antagonist, clobenpropit, and a neuroleptic, clozapine, activated GPRv53-expressing cells. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that expression of GPRv53 is localized in the peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, thymus, and colon, which was totally different from the H3 receptor, whose expression was restricted to the brain. The discovery of the GPRv53 receptor will open a new phase of research on the physiological role of histamine.

10978331|t|Retrovirally mediated complementation of the glyB phenotype. Cloning of a human gene encoding the carrier for entry of folates into mitochondria.
10978331|a|The transduction of a human placental cDNA retroviral library into glyB cells, a Chinese hamster ovary K1 subline that is deficient in the transport of folates into mitochondria, resulted in the complementation of glycine auxotrophy of these cells. A 2.6-kilobase pair cDNA insert flanked by retroviral sequences had integrated into genomic DNA in rescued cells. An open reading frame in this cDNA encoded a 35-kDa protein homologous to several inner mitochondrial wall transporters for intermediate metabolites. The subcloned cDNA complemented the glycine auxotrophy of glyB cells and reinstated folate accumulation in the mitochondria of transfected cells. The human origin, chromosomal location, and intron-exon organization of the isolated mitochondrial folate transporter gene were deduced from the expressed sequence tag database and human genome project data.

10978536|a|We isolated cDNA coding for the ninth of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-T9) from human brain by the polymerase chain reaction. The polypeptide encoded by GalNAc-T9 contained the structural features characteristic of GalNAc transferases, such as a GT1 motif, a Gal/GalNAc transferase motif, (QXW)(3) repeats, and conserved His, Cys, and acidic amino acid residues. Northern blot analysis revealed the mRNA expression of the enzyme to be confined to the brain. The brain-specific expression of GalNAc-T9 suggested that this isozyme catalyzes O-glycosylation in the brain.

10993894|t|The orthologous human and murine semaphorin 6A-1 proteins (SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1) bind to the enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-like protein (EVL) via a novel carboxyl-terminal zyxin-like domain.
10993894|a|Neuronal development and apoptosis critically depend on the transformation of extracellular signals to intracellular actions resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements. Ena/VASP (enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) proteins play an important role in actin and filament dynamics, whereas members of the semaphorin protein family are guidance signals in embryo- and organogenesis. Here, we report the identification of two novel transmembranous human and murine semaphorins, (HSA)SEMA6A-1 and (MMU)Sema6A-1. These semaphorin 6 variants directly link the Ena/VASP and the semaphorin protein family, since SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is capable of a selective binding to the protein EVL (Ena/VASP-like protein). EVL is the third member of the Ena/VASP family of proteins that was identified sharing the same structural features as Mena (mammalian enabled) and VASP, although its functionality seems to be different from that of the other members. Here we demonstrate that SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is colocalized with EVL via its zyxin-like carboxyl-terminal domain that contains a modified binding motif, which further stresses the existence of functional differences between EVL and Mena/VASP. In addition these findings suggest a completely new role for transmembranous semaphorins such as SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 in retrograde signaling.

10994649|t|A family of heptahelical receptors with adhesion-like domains: a marriage between two super families.
10994649|a|Some G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are regulators of cell adhesion via inside-out effector signaling pathways. Such is the case with leukocyte chemokine receptors which stimulate intracellular second messenger pathways resulting in upregulation of integrin adhesion to ligands present in the extracellular matrix or on opposing cells resulting in chemotaxis and extravasation during immune surveillance. Remarkably, a family of GPCRs has recently been discovered that may themselves be triggered by cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. Along with a canonical heptahelical membrane-spanning region, these intriguing proteins contain putative cell adhesion-like modules. The evidence to date suggests that they are involved in lymphocyte activation, macrophage biology, synaptic exocytosis and planar polarization during organogenesis.

11003675|t|Protein 4.1 R-135 interacts with a novel centrosomal protein (CPAP) which is associated with the gamma-tubulin complex.
11003675|a|Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a novel human centrosomal protein, CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated protein), which specifically interacts with the head domain of the 135-kDa protein 4.1R isoform (4.1R-135). Sequence analysis revealed that the carboxyl terminus of CPAP has 31.3% amino acid identity with human Tcp-10 (a t-complex responder gene product). Interestingly, most of the sequence identity is restricted to two conserved regions. One carries a leucine zipper, which may form a series of heptad repeats involved in coiled-coil formation; the other contains unusual glycine repeats with unknown function. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that CPAP and gamma-tubulin are localized within the centrosome throughout the cell cycle. CPAP cosediments with gamma-tubulin in sucrose gradients and coimmunoprecipitates with gamma-tubulin, indicating that CPAP is a part of the gamma-tubulin complex. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that CPAP is localized within the center of microtubule asters and may participate in microtubule nucleation. The formation of microtubule asters was significantly inhibited by anti-CPAP antibody. Together, these observations indicate that CPAP may play an important role in cell division and centrosome function.

11007475|a|The activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene, specifically expressed in germinal center B cells in mice, is a member of the cytidine deaminase family. We herein report mutations in the human counterpart of AID in patients with the autosomal recessive form of hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM2). Three major abnormalities characterize AID deficiency: (1) the absence of immunoglobulin class switch recombination, (2) the lack of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutations, and (3) lymph node hyperplasia caused by the presence of giant germinal centers. The phenotype observed in HIGM2 patients (and in AID-/- mice) demonstrates the absolute requirement for AID in several crucial steps of B cell terminal differentiation necessary for efficient antibody responses.

11027560|t|Molecular cloning of a human, hemicholinium-3-sensitive choline transporter.
11027560|a|Under many physiological circumstances, Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent, hemicholinium-3 (HC-3)-sensitive, high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) in cholinergic neurons is thought to be rate-limiting in the biosynthesis of acetylcholine (ACh). Based on sequence information provided by the Human Genome Project and the recently reported rat CHT1 (rCHT1), we cloned a human CHT cDNA from spinal cord. The hCHT cDNA encodes a protein of 580 amino acids having 93% identity to rCHT1 and 51% identity to the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog CHO-1, and is distantly related to members of the Na(+)-coupled glucose transporter (SGLT) gene family of Na(+)-coupled glucose (SGLT), nucleoside and iodide transporters. Northern blot analysis reveals the expression of a approximately 5 kb transcript in human brain regions rich in cholinergic neurons including the putamen, spinal cord, and medulla. Expression of hCHT cDNA in COS-7 cells results in saturable, Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent choline uptake (K(m) = 1.2 microM) in membrane vesicles and  HC-3 binding (K(d) = 4 nM) in membrane fractions, consistent with characteristics reported in mammalian cholinergic neurons. Using radiation hybrid mapping techniques, we localized the hCHT gene to human chromosome 2q12. These studies elucidate the primary structure and chromosomal localization of hCHT and provide a basis for mechanistic analysis of HACU regulation and an investigation of the role of hCHT in disease states.

Northern blotting detected a major 3.1-kilobase mRNA transcript as well as a minor 4.1-kilobase transcript in all human tissues examined. In several cancer cell lines, lower levels of mRNA expression were clearly evident. The gene encoding the human enzyme was mapped to chromosome band 1p32-35. High efficiency bacterial expression yielded 1.5 mg of recombinant enzyme/liter of culture medium. The molecular and kinetic properties of recombinant human NMN adenylyltransferase provide new directions for investigating metabolic pathways involving this enzyme.

11031099|t|SMARCAD1, a novel human helicase family-defining member associated with genetic instability: cloning, expression, and mapping to 4q22-q23, a band rich in breakpoints and deletion mutants involved in several human diseases.
11031099|a|Members of the DEAD/H box-containing helicase superfamily include proteins essential to genome replication, repair, and expression. We report here the cloning and initial characterization of a novel human member of this protein family, designated hHel1 (human helicase 1), now designated SMARCAD1 by HUGO. This DEAD/H box-containing molecule has seven highly conserved sequence regions that allow us to place it in the SNF2 family of the helicase superfamily. Uniquely, though, hHel1 contains two DEAD/H box motifs, a property not reported to be shared by any other SNF2 family members. This defines a new subfamily consisting of hHel1 and its homologues. In addition to these DEAD/H box/ATP-binding motifs, hHel1 has a putative nuclear localization signal and several regions that may mediate protein-protein interactions. Expression analysis indicates that hHel1 transcripts are ubiquitous, with particularly high levels in endocrine tissue. We have mapped the gene for hHel1 to human chromosome 4q22-q23; this region is rich in breakpoints and deletion mutants of genes involved in several human diseases, notably soft tissue leiomyosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hematologic malignancies. Our observation that human Hel1 gene overexpression is present in an E1A-expressing cell line with increased capacity for gene reactivation events by genomic rearrangement suggests that human Hel1 may play a role in genetic instability development.

11034316|t|Membrane-type 6 matrix metalloproteinase (MT6-MMP, MMP-25) is the second glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored MMP.
11034316|a|A recently identified membrane-type 6 matrix metalloproteinase (MT6-MMP) has a hydrophobic stretch of 24 amino acids at the C-terminus. This hydrophobicity pattern is similar to glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored MMP, MT4-MMP, and other GPI-anchored proteins. Thus, we tested the possibility that MT6-MMP was also a GPI-anchored proteinase. Our results showed that MT6-MMP as well as MT4-MMP were labeled with ethanolamine indicating the presence of a GPI unit with incorporated label. In addition, phosphatidyl inositol-specific phospholipase C treatment released MT6-MMP from the surface of transfected cells. These results strongly indicate that MT6-MMP is a GPI-anchored protein. Since two members of MT-MMPs are now assigned as GPI-anchored proteinase, MT-MMPs can be subgrouped into GPI type and transmembrane type.

11039935|t|Two-amino acid molecular switch in an epithelial morphogen that regulates binding to two distinct receptors.
11039935|a|Ectodysplasin, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, is encoded by the anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) gene. Mutations in EDA give rise to a clinical syndrome characterized by loss of hair, sweat glands, and teeth. EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are two isoforms of ectodysplasin that differ only by an insertion of two amino acids. This insertion functions to determine receptor binding specificity, such that EDA-A1 binds only the receptor EDAR, whereas EDA-A2 binds only the related, but distinct, X-linked ectodysplasin-A2 receptor (XEDAR). In situ binding and organ culture studies indicate that EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are differentially expressed and play a role in epidermal morphogenesis.

11042359|t|Cloning, localisation and functional expression of a novel human, cerebellum specific, two pore domain potassium channel.
11042359|a|We have isolated, by degenerate PCR, a complementary DNA encoding a novel two pore domain potassium channel. This is the 7th functional member of the human tandem pore domain potassium channel family to be reported. It has an open reading frame of 1.125 kb and encodes a 374 amino acid protein which shows 62% identity to the human TASK-1 gene: identity to other human members of the family is 31-35% at the amino acid level. We believe this gene to be human TASK-3, the ortholog of the recently reported rat TASK-3 gene: amino acid identity between the two is 74%. 'Taqman' mRNA analysis demonstrated a very specific tissue distribution pattern, showing human TASK-3 mRNA to be localised largely in the cerebellum, in contrast rat TASK-3 was reported to be widely distributed. We have shown by radiation hybrid mapping that human TASK-3 can be assigned to chromosome 8q24.3. Human TASK-3 was demonstrated to endow Xenopus oocytes with a negative resting membrane potential through the presence of a large K(+) selective conductance. TASK-3 is inhibited by extracellular acidosis with a mid-point of inhibition around pH 6. 5, supporting the predictions from the sequence data that this is a third human TASK (TWIK-related acid sensitive K(+) channel) gene.

11050005|t|A novel gene, MEL1, mapped to 1p36.3 is highly homologous to the MDS1/EVI1 gene and is transcriptionally activated in t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive leukemia cells.
11050005|a|The reciprocal translocation t(1;3)(p36;q21) occurs in a subset of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is frequently characterized by trilineage dysplasia, in particular dysmegakaryocytopoiesis, and poor prognosis. Previously, the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) at 3q21 was identified within a 60-kilobase (kb) region centromeric to the BCR of 3q21q26 syndrome and that at 1p36.3 within a 90-kb region. In this study, genes were searched near the breakpoints at 1p36.3, and a novel gene was isolated that encoded a zinc finger protein with a PR domain, which is highly homologous to the MDS1/EVI1 gene. The novel gene, designated as MEL1 (MDS1/EVI1-like gene 1), with 1257 amino acid residues is 64% similar in nucleotide and 63% similar in amino acid sequences to MDS1/EVI1 with the same domain structure. The MEL1 gene is expressed in leukemia cells with t(1;3) but not in other cell lines or bone marrow, spleen, and fetal liver, suggesting that MEL1 is specifically in the t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive MDS/AML. On the basis of the positional relationship between the EVI1 and MEL1 genes in each translocation, it was suggested that both genes are transcriptionally activated by the translocation of the 3q21 region with the Ribophorin I gene. Because of the transcriptional activation of the EVI1 family genes in both t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive MDS/AML and 3q21q26 syndrome, it is suggested that they share a common molecular mechanism for the leukemogenic transformation of the cells.

11054413|t|Bcl-G, a novel pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family.
11054413|a|A new member of the Bcl-2 family was identified, Bcl-G. The human BCL-G gene consists of 6 exons, resides on chromosome 12p12, and encodes two proteins through alternative mRNA splicing, Bcl-G(L) (long) and Bcl-G(S) (short) consisting of 327 and 252 amino acids in length, respectively. Bcl-G(L) and Bcl-G(S) have identical sequences for the first 226 amino acids but diverge thereafter. Among the Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains previously recognized in Bcl-2 family proteins, the BH3 domain is found in both Bcl-G(L) and Bcl-G(S), but only the longer Bcl-G(L) protein possesses a BH2 domain. Bcl-G(L) mRNA is expressed widely in adult human tissues, whereas Bcl-G(S) mRNA was found only in testis. Overexpression of Bcl-G(L) or Bcl-G(S) in cells induced apoptosis although Bcl-G(S) was far more potent than Bcl-G(L). Apoptosis induction by Bcl-G(S) depended on the BH3 domain and was suppressed by coexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-X(L) protein. Bcl-X(L) also coimmunoprecipitated with Bcl-G(S) but not with mutants of Bcl-G(S) in which the BH3 domain was deleted or mutated or with Bcl-G(L). Bcl-G(S) was predominantly localized to cytosolic organelles, whereas Bcl-G(L) was diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol. A mutant of Bcl-G(L) in which the BH2 domain was deleted displayed increased apoptotic activity and coimmunoprecipitated with Bcl-X(L), suggesting that the BH2 domain autorepresses Bcl-G(L).

11054547|t|Human serine racemase: moleular cloning, genomic organization and functional analysis.
11054547|a|High levels of D-serine are found in mammalian brain, where it is an endogenous agonist of the strichinine-insensitive site of N-methyl D-aspartate type of glutamate receptors. D-serine is enriched in protoplasmic astrocytes that occur in gray matter areas of the brain and was shown to be synthesized from L-serine. We now report cloning and expression of human serine racemase, an enzyme that catalyses the synthesis of D-serine from L-serine. The enzyme displays a high homology to the murine serine racemase. It contains a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate attachment sequence similar to bacterial biosynthetic threonine dehydratase. Northern-blot analysis show high levels of human serine racemase in areas known to contain large amounts of endogenous D-serine, such as hippocampus and corpus callosum. Robust synthesis of D-serine was detected in cells transfected with human serine racemase, demonstrating the conservation of D-amino acid metabolism in humans. Serine racemase may be a therapeutic target in psychiatric diseases as supplementation of D-serine greatly improves schizophrenia symptoms. We identify the human serine racemase genomic structure and show that the gene encompasses seven exons and localizes to chromosome 17q13.3. Identification of the intron-exon boundaries of the human serine racemase gene will be useful to search for mutations in neuropsychiatric disorders.

11054569|t|Rab6c, a new member of the rab gene family, is involved in drug resistance in MCF7/AdrR cells.
11054569|a|A new Rab6 homolog cDNA, Rab6c, was discovered by a hypermethylated DNA fragment probe that was isolated from a human multidrug resistant (MDR) breast cancer cell line, MCF7/AdrR, by the methylation sensitive-representational difference analysis (MS-RDA) technique. Rab6c was found to be under-expressed in MCF7/AdrR and MES-SA/Dx5 (a human MDR uterine sarcoma cell line) compared with their non-MDR parental cell lines. MCF7/AdrR cells expressing the exogenous Rab6c exhibited less resistance to several anti-cancer drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX), taxol, vinblastine, and vincristine, than the control cells containing the empty vector. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed that the transfectants' diminished resistance to DOX was caused by increased drug accumulation induced by the exogenous Rab6c. These results indicate that Rab6c is involved in drug resistance in MCF7/AdrR cells.

11056056|t|Genomic organization of the JEM-1 (BLZF1) gene on human chromosome 1q24: molecular cloning and analysis of its promoter region.
11056056|a|The Jem-1 (JEM-1, HGMW-approved symbol BLZF1) gene mapping to human chromosome 1q24 codes for a ubiquitously expressed 3-kb mRNA, translated in a 45-kDa nuclear protein. Recent studies have shown a deficient expression of this gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, treatment with retinoids was able to upregulate JEM-1 mRNA in maturing NB4 leukemia cells. Here, we report the characterization of the structural organization of JEM-1. By hybridization screening of a human genomic library derived from blood mononuclear cells, five overlapping genomic DNA clones were isolated. These clones extend over 34 kb of the human genome and comprise the complete JEM-1 gene and a 4-kb 5'flanking region. Determination of the exon-intron structure of Jem-1 revealed seven exons whose junctions with introns exhibited typical splice sequences. A shorter transcript (Jem-1s, 1.3 kb) generated by exon 3 extension and polyadenylation was identified. Its translation generated a 23-kDa protein that exhibited a cytoplasmic localization. 5'RACE-PCR identified a major transcription start site (TSS) located at 403 nt upstream of the ATG. Computer analysis of the 1. 8-kb 5'flanking region showed that it lacks a TATA box, Inr motifs or DPE motifs, but it contains a typical CCAAT box located 95 bp upstream of the TSS. Sequencing also revealed potential cis-acting elements for multiple transcription regulators including Sp1, GATA, C/EBP, AP-1, and Pu1. No retinoic acid receptor elements or retinoic X receptor elements were detected. This 1.8-kb DNA sequence showed a strong constitutive promoter activity determined by a luciferase-reporter gene assay in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Retinoids further increased luciferase expression 2.7-fold. We demonstrated that the 1-kb distal sequence contains yet unidentified elements reducing constitutive transcription. Thus, the maximal constitutive promoter activity was assigned to a -432 + 101 region overlapping the TSS. These data support the idea of a constitutive expression of JEM-1, but a negative regulation in APL released by retinoids.   Copyright 2000 Academic Press.

11058597|t|IL-17E, a novel proinflammatory ligand for the IL-17 receptor homolog IL-17Rh1.
11058597|a|We report identification of interleukin (IL)-17E, a novel member of the IL-17 family of cytokines. IL-17E is a ligand for the recently identified protein termed EVI27/IL-17BR, which we term IL-17 receptor homolog 1 (IL-17Rh1) in light of the multiple reported ligand-receptor relationships. Murine EVI27 was identified through its location at a common site of retroviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid leukemias. IL-17Rh1 shows highest level expression in kidney with moderate expression in multiple other organs, whereas IL-17E mRNA was detected at very low levels in several peripheral tissues. IL-17E induces activation of NF-kappaB and stimulates production of the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8.

11062248|t|Molecular cloning and characterization of the human protein kinase D2. A novel member of the protein kinase D family of serine threonine kinases.
11062248|a|We have isolated the full-length cDNA of a novel human serine threonine protein kinase gene. The deduced protein sequence contains two cysteine-rich motifs at the N terminus, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a catalytic domain containing all the characteristic sequence motifs of serine protein kinases. It exhibits the strongest homology to the serine threonine protein kinases PKD/PKCmicro and PKCnu, particularly in the duplex zinc finger-like cysteine-rich motif, in the pleckstrin homology domain and in the protein kinase domain. In contrast, it shows only a low degree of sequence similarity to other members of the PKC family. Therefore, the new protein has been termed protein kinase D2 (PKD2). The mRNA of PKD2 is widely expressed in human and murine tissues. It encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 105 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which is expressed in various human cell lines, including HL60 cells, which do not express PKCmicro. In vivo phorbol ester binding studies demonstrated a concentration-dependent binding of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to PKD2. The addition of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate in the presence of dioleoylphosphatidylserine stimulated the autophosphorylation of PKD2 in a synergistic fashion. Phorbol esters also stimulated autophosphorylation of PKD2 in intact cells. PKD2 activated by phorbol esters efficiently phosphorylated the exogenous substrate histone H1. In addition, we could identify the C-terminal Ser(876) residue as an in vivo phosphorylation site within PKD2. Phosphorylation of Ser(876) of PKD2 correlated with the activation status of the kinase. Finally, gastrin was found to be a physiological activator of PKD2 in human AGS-B cells stably transfected with the CCK(B)/gastrin receptor. Thus, PKD2 is a novel phorbol ester- and growth factor-stimulated protein kinase.

11063725|t|The Fanconi anemia protein FANCF forms a nuclear complex with FANCA, FANCC and FANCG.
11063725|a|Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosomal instability syndrome associated with a strong predisposition to cancer, particularly acute myeloid leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma. At the cellular level, FA is characterized by spontaneous chromosomal breakage and a unique hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents. Complementation analysis has indicated that at least seven distinct genes are involved in the pathogenesis of FA. Despite the identification of four of these genes (FANCA, FANCC, FANCF and FANCG), the nature of the 'FA pathway' has remained enigmatic, as the FA proteins lack sequence homologies or motifs that could point to a molecular function. To further define this pathway, we studied the subcellular localizations and mutual interactions of the FA proteins, including the recently identified FANCF protein, in human lymphoblasts. FANCF was found predominantly in the nucleus, where it complexes with FANCA, FANCC and FANCG. These interactions were detected in wild-type and FA-D lymphoblasts, but not in lymphoblasts of other FA complementation groups. This implies that each of the FA proteins, except FANCD, is required for these complexes to form. Similarly, we show that the interaction between FANCA and FANCC is restricted to wild-type and FA-D cells. Furthermore, we document the subcellular localization of FANCA and the FANCA/FANCG complex in all FA complementation groups. Our results, along with published data, culminate in a model in which a multi-protein FA complex serves a nuclear function to maintain genomic integrity.

11075807|t|FIF , a nuclear putatively antiapoptotic factor, interacts specifically with FGF-2.
11075807|a|Numerous evidence indicates that some of the activities of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) depend on an intracrine mode of action. Recently, we showed that three high molecular mass (HMM) nuclear forms of FGF-2 are part of a 320-kDa protein complex while the cytoplasmic AUG-initiated form is included in a 130-kDa complex. Consequently, the characterization of FGF endogenous targets has become crucial to allow the elucidation of their endogenous activities. Through the screening of GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid expression libraries, we have isolated a gene encoding a nuclear protein of 55 kDa, FIF (FGF-2-interacting-factor), which interacts specifically with FGF-2 but not with FGF-1, FGF-3, or FGF-6. In this system, FIF interacts equally well with the NH2-extended 24-kDa FGF form as with the 18-kDa form, indicating that the FIF-binding motif is located in the last 155 amino acids of FGF-2. Nevertheless, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed an exclusive association with HMM FGF-2. The predicted protein contains a canonical leucine zipper domain and three overlapping hydrophobic heptad repeats. The region spanning these repeats is, together with a region located in the N-terminal part of the FIF protein, implicated in the binding to FGF-2. In contrast to the full-length FIF protein, several deletion constructs were able to transactivate a lac-Z reporter gene. Furthermore, the COOH-terminal part, but not the full-length FIF protein, has previously been shown to exhibit antiapoptotic properties. Thus we discuss the possibility that these activities could reflect a physiological function of FIF through its interaction with FGF-2.

11076957|t|Molecular cloning and characterization of DEFCAP-L and -S, two isoforms of a novel member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of apoptosis proteins.
11076957|a|We report the deduced amino acid sequences of two alternately spliced isoforms, designated DEFCAP-L and -S, that differ in 44 amino acids and encode a novel member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of apoptosis proteins. Similar to the other mammalian Ced-4 proteins (Apaf-1 and Nod1), DEFCAP contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and a putative nucleotide binding domain, signified by a consensus Walker's A box (P-loop) and B box (Mg(2+)-binding site). Like Nod1, but different from Apaf-1, DEFCAP contains a putative regulatory domain containing multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRR). However, a distinguishing feature of the primary sequence of DEFCAP is that DEFCAP contains at its NH(2) terminus a pyrin-like motif and a proline-rich sequence, possibly involved in protein-protein interactions with Src homology domain 3-containing proteins. By using in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments, both long and short isoforms were capable of strongly interacting with caspase-2 and exhibited a weaker interaction with caspase-9. Transient overexpression of full-length DEFCAP-L, but not DEFCAP-S, in breast adenocarcinoma cells MCF7 resulted in significant levels of apoptosis. In vitro death assays with transient overexpression of deletion constructs of both isoforms using beta-galactosidase as a reporter gene in MCF7 cells suggest the following: 1) the nucleotide binding domain may act as a negative regulator of the killing activity of DEFCAP; 2) the LRR/CARD represents a putative constitutively active inducer of apoptosis; 3) the killing activity of LRR/CARD is inhibitable by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone and to a lesser extent by Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; and 4) the CARD is critical for killing activity of DEFCAP. These results suggest that DEFCAP is a novel member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of proteins capable of inducing apoptosis, and understanding its regulation may elucidate the complex nature of the mammalian apoptosis-promoting machinery.

11080599|t|Identification of cDNAs encoding two novel nuclear proteins, IMUP-1 and IMUP-2, upregulated in SV40-immortalized human fibroblasts.
11080599|a|Using a model system of young, senescent and SV40-immortalized WI-38 fibroblasts, we identified two mRNAs upregulated in immortalized cells (imup-1, immortalization-upregulated protein 1, and imup-2). Compared to normal tissues, both genes were more frequently expressed in cancer cells. The open reading frame of imup-1 spans 321bp, coding for a 10.9 kDa protein of 106 amino acids, while an insertion of 59bp in the otherwise identical mRNA of imup-2 leads to a frameshift, resulting in an 8.5 kDa protein of 85 amino acids. Database searches identified these genes on chromosome 19, which could account for the cloned imup-1 and imup-2 transcripts by alternative splicing. Southern blot analysis of digested genomic DNA confirmed that both transcripts are derived from a single locus. The expressed proteins IMUP-1 and IMUP-2 share 46 identical N-terminal amino acids, whereas the C-termini are unrelated. Green fluorescent protein-fusions of both IMUP-1 and IMUP-2 accumulated in the nucleus of HeLa cells. The C-terminus of IMUP-1 contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, the deletion of which impaired nuclear translocation. In-vitro translated proteins bound to poly(rG), but did not interact with single-stranded DNA or double-stranded DNA. The nuclear localization of IMUP-1 and IMUP-2 as well as the upregulation of both underlying mRNAs in immortalized cells suggest a function in immortalization.

11081504|t|Interleukin 21 and its receptor are involved in NK cell expansion and regulation of lymphocyte function.
11081504|a|Cytokines are important in the regulation of haematopoiesis and immune responses, and can influence lymphocyte development. Here we have identified a class I cytokine receptor that is selectively expressed in lymphoid tissues and is capable of signal transduction. The full-length receptor was expressed in BaF3 cells, which created a functional assay for ligand detection and cloning. Conditioned media from activated human CD3+ T cells supported proliferation of the assay cell line. We constructed a complementary DNA expression library from activated human CD3+ T cells, and identified a cytokine with a four-helix-bundle structure using functional cloning. This cytokine is most closely related to IL2 and IL15, and has been designated IL21 with the receptor designated IL21 R. In vitro assays suggest that IL21 has a role in the proliferation and maturation of natural killer (NK) cell populations from bone marrow, in the proliferation of mature B-cell populations co-stimulated with anti-CD40, and in the proliferation of T cells co-stimulated with anti-CD3.

11084341|t|The novel Rho-family GTPase rif regulates coordinated actin-based membrane rearrangements.
11084341|a|Small GTPases of the Rho family have a critical role in controlling cell morphology, motility and adhesion through dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . Individual Rho GTPases have been shown to regulate distinct components of the cytoskeletal architecture; RhoA stimulates the bundling of actin filaments into stress fibres , Rac reorganises actin to produce membrane sheets or lamellipodia  and Cdc42 causes the formation of thin, actin-rich surface projections called filopodia . We have isolated a new Rho-family GTPase, Rif (Rho in filopodia), and shown that it represents an alternative signalling route to the generation of filopodial structures. Coordinated regulation of Rho-family GTPases can be used to generate more complicated actin rearrangements, such as those underlying cell migration . In addition to inducing filopodia, Rif functions cooperatively with Cdc42 and Rac to generate additional structures, increasing the diversity of actin-based morphology.

11085512|t|Mitomycin C resistance induced by TCF-3 overexpression in gastric cancer cell line MKN28 is associated with DT-diaphorase down-regulation.
11085512|a|TCF transcription factors are mediators of the WNT signaling pathway and are antagonized by the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway. Here human TCF-3 has been cloned and characterized. Differential expression analyses of TCF genes in gastric cancer revealed that TCF-1 was expressed in most cases of primary gastric cancer at almost the same level as in normal gastric mucosa and that TCF-3 was occasionally up-regulated in primary gastric cancer. The TCF-3 expression vector was transfected to gastric cancer cell line MKN28 to establish stable transformants. Three independent MKN28 transformants overexpressing TCF-3 showed about 8-fold resistance to mitomycin C (MMC; IC50, 2.4 microg/ml) compared with MKN28 vector transfectants (IC50 = 0.3 microg/ml). Among the 10 drug resistance-associated genes examined in this study, the DT-diaphorase (DTD) gene was down-regulated in three MKN28 transformants overexpressing TCF-3. DTD mRNA was also down-regulated in primary gastric cancer with TCF-3 up-regulation. In addition, DTD protein was down-regulated in three MKN28 transformants overexpressing TCF-3 compared with MKN28 vector transfectants. DTD is implicated in the activation of MMC in target cells, and DTD down-regulation explains MMC resistance. MMC resistance induced by TCF-3 overexpression is probably due to DTD down-regulation, which might provide a possible target for new therapy of drug-resistant gastric cancer.

11086001|t|betaIV spectrin, a new spectrin localized at axon initial segments and nodes of ranvier in the central and peripheral nervous system.
11086001|a|We report the identification of betaIV spectrin, a novel spectrin isolated as an interactor of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase-like protein ICA512. The betaIV spectrin gene is located on human and mouse chromosomes 19q13.13 and 7b2, respectively. Alternative splicing of betaIV spectrin generates at least four distinct isoforms, numbered betaIVSigma1-betaIVSigma4 spectrin. The longest isoform (betaIVSigma1 spectrin) includes an actin-binding domain, followed by 17 spectrin repeats, a specific domain in which the amino acid sequence ERQES is repeated four times, several putative SH3-binding sites and a pleckstrin homology domain. betaIVSigma2 and betaIVSigma3 spectrin encompass the NH(2)- and COOH-terminal halves of betaIVSigma1 spectrin, respectively, while betaIVSigma4 spectrin lacks the ERQES and the pleckstrin homology domain. Northern blots revealed an abundant expression of betaIV spectrin transcripts in brain and pancreatic islets. By immunoblotting, betaIVSigma1 spectrin is recognized as a protein of 250 kD. Anti-betaIV spectrin antibodies also react with two additional isoforms of 160 and 140 kD. These isoforms differ from betaIVSigma1 spectrin in terms of their distribution on subcellular fractionation, detergent extractability, and phosphorylation. In islets, the immunoreactivity for betaIV spectrin is more prominent in alpha than in beta cells. In brain, betaIV spectrin is enriched in myelinated neurons, where it colocalizes with ankyrin(G) 480/270-kD at axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier. Likewise, betaIV spectrin is concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier in the rat sciatic nerve. In the rat hippocampus, betaIVSigma1 spectrin is detectable from embryonic day 19, concomitantly with the appearance of immunoreactivity at the initial segments. Thus, we suggest that betaIVSigma1 spectrin interacts with ankyrin(G) 480/270-kD and participates in the clustering of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and cell-adhesion molecules at initial segments and nodes of Ranvier.

11095982|t|Characterization of C14orf4, a novel intronless human gene containing a polyglutamine repeat, mapped to the ARVD1 critical region.
11095982|a|Within the ARVD1 (arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy, type 1) critical region, mapped to 14q24.3, we detected an intronless gene of 4859 bp, predominantly expressed in the heart tissue. This gene encodes a 796-amino-acid, proline-rich protein showing polyglutamine and polyalanine tracks with variable length at the N-terminus and a C3HC4 RING finger domain at the C-terminus. CREB and AP-2 binding sites are present in the promoter region. The 5' flanking region contains neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box, but it is high in GC content and includes several Sp1 binding sites. Protein similarity searches revealed a significant match between the C-terminus and a human hypothetical protein, whose gene is located on the chromosome 19 long arm. The predicted protein shows PEST sequences, suggesting its rapid degradation. The novel intronless gene, provisionally named C14orf4 and probably encoding a nuclear protein, was excluded from being the ARVD1 gene.   Copyright 2000 Academic Press.

11102511|t|Human orthologs of yeast vacuolar protein sorting proteins Vps26, 29, and 35: assembly into multimeric complexes.
11102511|a|Sorting nexin (SNX) 1 and SNX2 are mammalian orthologs of Vps5p, a yeast protein that is a subunit of a large multimeric complex, termed the retromer complex, involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. We report the cloning and characterization of human orthologs of three additional components of the complex: Vps26p, Vps29p, and Vps35p. The close structural similarity between the yeast and human proteins suggests a similarity in function. We used both yeast two-hybrid assays and expression in mammalian cells to define the binding interactions among these proteins. The data suggest a model in which hVps35 serves as the core of a multimeric complex by binding directly to hVps26, hVps29, and SNX1. Deletional analyses of hVps35 demonstrate that amino acid residues 1-53 and 307-796 of hVps35 bind to the coiled coil-containing domain of SNX1. In contrast, hVps26 binds to amino acid residues 1-172 of hVps35, whereas hVps29 binds to amino acid residues 307-796 of hVps35. Furthermore, hVps35, hVps29, and hVps26 have been found in membrane-associated and cytosolic compartments. Gel filtration chromatography of COS7 cell cytosol showed that both recombinant and endogenous hVps35, hVps29, and hVps26 coelute as a large complex ( approximately 220-440 kDa). In the absence of hVps35, neither hVps26 nor hVps29 is found in the large complex. These data provide the first insights into the binding interactions among subunits of a putative mammalian retromer complex.

11110791|t|Three novel components of the human exosome.
11110791|a|The yeast exosome is a complex of 3' --> 5' exoribonucleases. Sequence analysis identified putative human homologues for exosome components, although several were found only as expressed sequence tags. Here we report the cloning of full-length cDNAs, which encode putative human homologues of the Rrp40p, Rrp41p, and Rrp46p components of the exosome. Recombinant proteins were expressed and used to raise rabbit antisera. In Western blotting experiments, these decorated HeLa cell proteins of the predicted sizes. All three human proteins were enriched in the HeLa cells nucleus and nucleolus, but were also clearly detected in the cytoplasm. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p were present in a large complex. This cofractionated with the human homologues of other exosome components, hRrp4p and PM/Scl-100. Anti-PM/Scl-positive patient sera coimmunoprecipitated hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p demonstrating their physical association. The immunoprecipitated complex exhibited 3' --> 5' exoribonuclease activity in vitro. hRrp41p was expressed in yeast and shown to suppress the lethality of genetic depletion of yeast Rrp41p. We conclude that hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p represent novel components of the human exosome complex.

11121057|t|Comparative structural and functional analysis of the olfactory receptor genes flanking the human and mouse beta-globin gene clusters.
11121057|a|By sequencing regions flanking the beta-globin gene complex in mouse (Hbbc) and human (HBBC), we have shown that the beta-globin gene cluster is surrounded by a larger cluster of olfactory receptor genes (ORGs). To facilitate sequence comparisons and to investigate the regulation of ORG expression, we have mapped 5' sequences of mRNA from olfactory epithelium encoding beta-globin-proximal ORGs. We have found that several of these genes contain multiple noncoding exons that can be alternatively spliced. Surprisingly, the only common motifs found in the promoters of these genes are a "TATA" box and a purine-rich motif. Sequence comparisons between human and mouse reveal that most of the conserved regions are confined to the coding regions and transcription units of the genes themselves, but a few blocks of conserved sequence also are found outside of ORG transcription units. The possible influence of beta-globin regulatory sequences on ORG expression in olfactory epithelium was tested in mice containing a deletion of the endogenous beta-globin locus control region, but no change in expression of the neighboring ORGs was detected. We evaluate the implications of these results for possible mechanisms of regulation of ORG transcription.

11133773|t|Characterization of human sialoadhesin, a sialic acid binding receptor expressed by resident and inflammatory macrophage populations.
11133773|a|Sialoadhesin is a macrophage-restricted cellular interaction molecule and a prototypic member of the Siglec family of sialic acid binding immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectins. So far, it has only been characterized in rodents. Here, we report the molecular cloning, binding properties, and expression pattern of human sialoadhesin. The predicted protein sequences of human and mouse sialoadhesin are about 72% identical, with the greatest similarity in the extracellular region, which comprises 17 Ig domains in both species. A recombinant protein consisting of the first 4 N-terminal domains of human sialoadhesin fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 mediated sialic acid-dependent binding with a specificity similar to its mouse counterpart, preferring sialic acid in the alpha2,3 glycosidic linkage over the alpha2,6 linkage. By flow cytometry with peripheral blood leukocytes, recombinant sialoadhesin bound strongly to granulocytes with intermediate binding to monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells, and a subset of CD8 T cells. Using antibodies raised to the recombinant protein, sialoadhesin was immunoprecipitated from the THP-1 human monocytic cell line as an approximate 200-kd glycoprotein. The expression pattern of human sialoadhesin was found to be similar to that of the mouse receptor, being absent from monocytes and other peripheral blood leukocytes, but expressed strongly by tissue macrophages in the spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, liver, colon, and lungs. High expression was also found on inflammatory macrophages present in affected tissues from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

11152476|t|The neural cell recognition molecule neurofascin interacts with syntenin-1 but not with syntenin-2, both of which reveal self-associating activity.
11152476|a|Neurofascin belongs to the L1 subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules and is implicated in axonal growth and fasciculation. We used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins that interact with neurofascin intracellularly and therefore might link it to trafficking, spatial targeting, or signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that rat syntenin-1, previously published as syntenin, mda-9, or TACIP18 in human, is a neurofascin-binding protein that exhibits a wide-spread tissue expression pattern with a relative maximum in brain. Syntenin-1 was found not to interact with other vertebrate members of the L1 subgroup such as L1 itself or NrCAM. We confirmed the specificity of the neurofascin-syntenin-1 interaction by ligand-overlay assay, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and colocalization of both proteins in heterologous cells. The COOH terminus of neurofascin was mapped to interact with the second PDZ domain of syntenin-1. Furthermore, we isolated syntenin-2 that may be expressed in two isoforms. Despite their high sequence similarity to syntenin-1, syntenin-2alpha, which interacts with neurexin I, and syntenin-2beta do not bind to neurofascin or several other transmembrane proteins that are binding partners of syntenin-1. Finally, we report that syntenin-1 and -2 both form homodimers and can interact with each other.

11152479|t|Identification of a novel thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein.
11152479|a|We recently identified a series of transforming growth factor-beta-responsive genes in A549 human adenocarcinoma cell line by a gene trap screening method. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of one of these genes, designated TMX, that encodes a novel protein of 280 amino acid residues. The TMX protein possesses an N-terminal signal peptide followed by one thioredoxin (Trx)-like domain with a unique active site sequence, Cys-Pro-Ala-Cys, and a potential transmembrane domain. There are putative TMX homologs with identical active site sequences in the Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genomes. Using recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, we demonstrated the activity of the Trx domain of TMX to cleave the interchain disulfide bridges in insulin in vitro. The TMX transcript is widely expressed in normal human tissues, and subcellular fractionation and immunostaining for an epitope-tagged TMX protein suggest that TMX is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When TMX was expressed in HEK293 cells, it significantly suppressed the apoptosis induced by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ER-Golgi transport. This activity was abolished when two Cys residues in the active site sequence were mutated to Ser, suggesting that the Trx-like activity of TMX may help relieve ER stress caused by brefeldin A.

11158580|t|Regulation of Smad degradation and activity by Smurf2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase.
11158580|a|Smad proteins are key intracellular signaling effectors for the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily of peptide growth factors. Following receptor-induced activation, Smads move into the nucleus to activate transcription of a select set of target genes. The activity of Smad proteins must be tightly regulated to exert the biological effects of different ligands in a timely manner. Here, we report the identification of Smurf2, a new member of the Hect family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Smurf2 selectively interacts with receptor-regulated Smads and preferentially targets Smad1 for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. At higher expression levels, Smurf2 also decreases the protein levels of Smad2, but not Smad3. In Xenopus embryos, ectopic Smurf2 expression specifically inhibits Smad1 responses and thereby affects embryonic patterning by bone morphogenetic protein signals. These findings suggest that Smurf2 may regulate the competence of a cell to respond to transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein signaling through a distinct degradation pathway that is similar to, yet independent of, Smurf1.

11163187|t|Human Upf proteins target an mRNA for nonsense-mediated decay when bound downstream of a termination codon.
11163187|a|Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) rids eukaryotic cells of aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination codons. These are discriminated from true termination codons by downstream cis-elements, such as exon-exon junctions. We describe three novel human proteins involved in NMD, hUpf2, hUpf3a, and hUpf3b. While in HeLa cell extracts these proteins are complexed with hUpf1, in intact cells hUpf3a and hUpf3b are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins, hUpf2 is perinuclear, and hUpf1 cytoplasmic. hUpf3a and hUpf3b associate selectively with spliced beta-globin mRNA in vivo, and tethering of any hUpf protein to the 3'UTR of beta-globin mRNA elicits NMD. These data suggest that assembly of a dynamic hUpf complex initiates in the nucleus at mRNA exon-exon junctions and triggers NMD in the cytoplasm when recognized downstream of a translation termination site.

11165367|t|Identification of four novel human G protein-coupled receptors expressed in the brain.
11165367|a|We report the discovery and tissue distributions of four novel human genes, GPR61, GPR62, GPR63 and GPR77, all of which encode G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPR61 was discovered in a search of the patent literature which retrieved a rabbit DNA sequence partially encoding a novel GPCR. This sequence was used to obtain a full-length human cDNA encoding GPR61, a receptor of 417 amino acid length. A search of the GenBank genomic sequence databases revealed three previously unrecognized intronless genes encoding the orphan GPCrs (oGPCRs) GPR62, GPR63 and GPR77, with respective amino acid lengths of 368, 419 and 337. Sequence analysis revealed that GPR61 and GPR62, and a published orphan receptor p47MNR, shared the highest level of identities to each other, ranging from 36 to 45% in the transmembrane (TM) domains. Together, these three oGPCRs appear to comprise a novel subfamily of GPCRs, most closely related to the serotonin 5-HT(6) receptor. Sequence analysis of GPR63 and GPR77 revealed highest sequence identities in the TM regions with the oGPCR PSP24 (58%) and the anaphylatoxin C5a receptor (49%) respectively. Tissue distribution analyses detected the expression of all four novel genes in the human brain. GPR61 mRNA expression was detected in the caudate, putamen and thalamus of human brain, with a more widespread expression pattern in rat brain, with mRNA signals in areas of the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain. GPR62 mRNA expression was detected in the basal forebrain, frontal cortex, caudate, putamen, thalamus and hippocampus. GPR63 mRNA expression was detected in the frontal cortex, with lower levels in the thalamus, caudate, hypothalamus and midbrain. Analysis of GPR77 mRNA expression revealed signals in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus with high transcript levels in the liver.

11171957|t|Identification of two novel transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamic acid proteins expressed broadly in fetal and adult tissues.
11171957|a|The proline-rich gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2 are the founding members of a family of vitamin K-dependent single-pass integral membrane proteins characterized by an extracellular amino terminal domain of approximately 45 amino acids that is rich in Gla. The intracellular carboxyl terminal region of these two proteins contains one or two copies of the sequence PPXY, a motif present in a variety of proteins involved in such diverse cellular functions as signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and protein turnover. In this report, we describe the cloning of the cDNAs for two additional human transmembrane Gla proteins (TMG) of 20-24 kDa named TMG3 and TMG4. These two proteins possess extracellular Gla domains with 13 or 9 potential Gla residues, respectively, followed by membrane-spanning hydrophobic regions and cytoplasmic carboxyl terminal regions that contain PPXY motifs. This emerging family of integral membrane Gla proteins includes proline-rich Gla protein (PRGP) 1, PRGP2, TMG3, and TMG4, all of which are characterized by broad and variable distribution in both fetal and adult tissues. Members of this family can be grouped into two subclasses on the basis of their gene organization and amino acid sequence. These observations suggest novel physiological functions for vitamin K beyond its known role in the biosynthesis of proteins involved in blood coagulation and bone development. The identification and characterization of these proteins may allow a more complete understanding of the teratogenic consequences of exposure in utero to vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin-based anticoagulants.

11172815|t|Functional characterization of novel human ARFGAP3.
11172815|a|ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) are critical in the vesicular trafficking pathway. ARF activity is controlled by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). We have identified recently a novel tentative ARF GAP derived from human fetal liver, ARFGAP3 (originally named as ARFGAP1). In the present study, we demonstrated that ARFGAP3 had GAP activity in vitro and remarked that the GAP activity of ARFGAP3 was regulated by phospholipids, i.e. phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate as agonist and phosphatidylcholine as antagonist. ARFGAP3 is a predominantly cytosolic protein, and concentrated in the perinuclear region. Its transient ectopic overexpression in cultured mammalian cells reduced the constitutive secretion of secreted alkaline phosphatase, indicating that ectopic overexpression of ARFGAP3 inhibits the early secretory pathway of proteins in vivo. These results demonstrated that ARFGAP3 is a novel GAP for ARF1 and might be involved in intracellular traffic of proteins and vesicular transport as predicted.

11196645|t|Identification of the platelet ADP receptor targeted by antithrombotic drugs.
11196645|a|Platelets have a crucial role in the maintenance of normal haemostasis, and perturbations of this system can lead to pathological thrombus formation and vascular occlusion, resulting in stroke, myocardial infarction and unstable angina. ADP released from damaged vessels and red blood cells induces platelet aggregation through activation of the integrin GPIIb-IIIa and subsequent binding of fibrinogen. ADP is also secreted from platelets on activation, providing positive feedback that potentiates the actions of many platelet activators. ADP mediates platelet aggregation through its action on two G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes. The P2Y1 receptor couples to Gq and mobilizes intracellular calcium ions to mediate platelet shape change and aggregation. The second ADP receptor required for aggregation (variously called P2Y(ADP), P2Y(AC), P2Ycyc or P2T(AC)) is coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase through Gi. The molecular identity of the Gi-linked receptor is still elusive, even though it is the target of efficacious antithrombotic agents, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel and AR-C66096 (ref. 9). Here we describe the cloning of this receptor, designated P2Y12, and provide evidence that a patient with a bleeding disorder has a defect in this gene. Cloning of the P2Y12 receptor should facilitate the development of better antiplatelet agents to treat cardiovascular diseases.

11230181|t|WBSCR14, a gene mapping to the Williams--Beuren syndrome deleted region, is a new member of the Mlx transcription factor network.
11230181|a|Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a developmental disorder associated with haploinsufficiency of multiple genes at 7q11.23. Here, we report the functional characterization of WBS critical region gene 14 (WBSCR14), a gene contained in the WBS commonly deleted region. It encodes a basic-helix--loop--helix leucine zipper (bHLHZip) transcription factor of the Myc/Max/Mad superfamily. WBSCR14 is expressed in multiple tissues, including regions of the brain and the intestinal tract. WBSCR14 forms heterodimers with the bHLHZip protein Mlx to bind the DNA sequence CACGTG. Like Max, Mlx has no intrinsic transcriptional activity, but its association with Mad1, Mad4, Mnt or WBSCR14 can repress E-box-dependent transcription. Preliminary results suggest a possible role of WBSCR14 in growth control. Our data support the view that the Max-like bHLHZip protein, Mlx, is a key element of a transcription factor network. We thus suggest that WBSCR14 may contribute to some aspects of the WBS pathology.

11238452|t|Cargo of kinesin identified as JIP scaffolding proteins and associated signaling molecules.
11238452|a|The cargo that the molecular motor kinesin moves along microtubules has been elusive. We searched for binding partners of the COOH terminus of kinesin light chain, which contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. Three proteins were found, the c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting proteins (JIPs) JIP-1, JIP-2, and JIP-3, which are scaffolding proteins for the JNK signaling pathway. Concentration of JIPs in nerve terminals requires kinesin, as evident from the analysis of JIP COOH-terminal mutants and dominant negative kinesin constructs. Coprecipitation experiments suggest that kinesin carries the JIP scaffolds preloaded with cytoplasmic (dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase) and transmembrane signaling molecules (the Reelin receptor, ApoER2). These results demonstrate a direct interaction between conventional kinesin and a cargo, indicate that motor proteins are linked to their membranous cargo via scaffolding proteins, and support a role for motor proteins in spatial regulation of signal transduction pathways.

11239445|t|ULBPs, novel MHC class I-related molecules, bind to CMV glycoprotein UL16 and stimulate NK cytotoxicity through the NKG2D receptor.
11239445|a|The human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein, UL16, binds to two members of a novel family of molecules, the ULBPs, and to the MHC class I homolog, MICB. The ULBPs are GPI-linked glycoproteins belonging to the extended MHC class I family but are only distantly related to MICB. The ULBP and MICB molecules are ligands for the activating receptor, NKG2D/DAP10, and this interaction is blocked by a soluble form of UL16. The ULBPs stimulate cytokine and chemokine production from NK cells, and expression of ULBPs in NK cell-resistant target cells confers susceptibility to NK cell cytotoxicity. Masking of NK cell recognition of ULBP or MIC antigens by UL16 provides a potential mechanism by which human cytomegalovirus-infected cells might evade attack by the immune system.

11243782|t|Identification of muscle specific ring finger proteins as potential regulators of the titin kinase domain.
11243782|a|The giant myofibrillar protein titin contains within its C-terminal region a serine-threonine kinase of unknown function. We have identified a novel muscle specific RING finger protein, referred to as MURF-1, that binds in vitro to the titin repeats A168/A169 adjacent to the titin kinase domain. In myofibrils, MURF-1 is present within the periphery of the M-line lattice in close proximity to titin's catalytic kinase domain, within the Z-line lattice, and also in soluble form within the cytoplasm. Yeast two-hybrid screens with MURF-1 as a bait identified two other highly homologous MURF proteins, MURF-2 and MURF-3. MURF-1,2,3 proteins are encoded by distinct genes, share highly conserved N-terminal RING domains and in vitro form dimers/heterodimers by shared coiled-coil motifs. Of the MURF family, only MURF-1 interacts with titin repeats A168/A169, whereas MURF-3 has been reported to affect microtubule stability. Association of MURF-1 with M-line titin may potentially modulate titin's kinase activity similar to other known kinase-associated proteins, whereas differential expression and heterodimerization of MURF1, 2 and 3 may link together titin kinase and microtubule-dependent signal pathways in striated muscles.

11255011|t|MMP-28, a new human matrix metalloproteinase with an unusual cysteine-switch sequence is widely expressed in tumors.
11255011|a|We report the discovery, cloning, and characterization of a novel human matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-28) cDNA gene. The deduced 520-amino-acid sequence of MMP-28 includes a signal peptide, a prodomain with an unusual cysteine-switch PRCGVTD motif followed by the furin cleavage RRKKR site, a catalytic domain, a hinge-region and a hemopexin-like domain. On the basis of their structural characteristics, MMP-28 belongs to the MMP-19 subfamily. The genomic MMP-28 gene uniquely mapped to chromosome 17q11.2 includes eight exons and seven introns. The broad range of expression in carcinomas as well as normal adult and fetal tissues suggests an important functional role for MMP-28.

11259612|t|Identification of two prokineticin cDNAs: recombinant proteins potently contract gastrointestinal smooth muscle.
11259612|a|The motility of gastrointestinal tract is regulated by classical neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and humoral agents. Two novel human cDNAs have been cloned based on their sequence similarity to a frog skin secretion protein, Bv8, and a nontoxic protein of mamba snake venom. These human cDNAs encode two secreted proteins of 86 and 81 amino acids. Northern blot hybridization has revealed that these cDNAs are expressed in gastrointestinal tract, particularly the stomach. Recombinant proteins with authentic N-terminal sequences have been produced in Escherichia coli and refolded into functional proteins by careful control of protein aggregation. Mass spectrometry has confirmed the formation of five pairs of disulfide bonds. The refolded recombinant proteins potently contract gastrointestinal smooth muscle with EC(50) values in the subnanomolar range. The contractile effects of the recombinant proteins are specific for gastrointestinal smooth muscle, because they have no effect on vascular or respiratory smooth muscle. To reflect their potent and specific effects on gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells, we have named these recombinant proteins prokineticins. Ligand binding studies with iodinated prokineticin revealed the presence of a high-affinity site in ileal smooth muscle. The displacement of specific binding by GTP gamma S suggests that the prokineticin receptor may belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Experiments with verapamil and nifedipine revealed that calcium influx is essential for the contractile activity of prokineticins on gastrointestinal smooth muscle. In summary, we have identified two novel endogenous regulators of gastrointestinal motility. The availability of recombinant prokineticins should provide novel therapeutic agents for disorders involving impaired gastrointestinal motility.

11278579|t|Expression of CaT-like, a novel calcium-selective channel, correlates with the malignancy of prostate cancer.
11278579|a|The regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) plays a key role in the development and growth of cells. Here we report the cloning and functional expression of a highly calcium-selective channel localized on the human chromosome 7. The sequence of the new channel is structurally related to the gene product of the CaT1 protein cloned from rat duodenum and is therefore called CaT-like (CaT-L). CaT-L is expressed in locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic and androgen-insensitive prostatic lesions but is undetectable in healthy prostate tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Additionally, CaT-L is expressed in normal placenta, exocrine pancreas, and salivary glands. New markers with well defined biological function that correlate with aberrant cell growth are needed for the molecular staging of cancer and to predict the clinical outcome. The human CaT-L channel represents a marker for prostate cancer progression and may serve as a target for therapeutic strategies.

11278593|t|Human corneal GlcNac 6-O-sulfotransferase and mouse intestinal GlcNac 6-O-sulfotransferase both produce keratan sulfate.
11278593|a|Human corneal N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase (hCGn6ST) has been identified by the positional candidate approach as the gene responsible for macular corneal dystrophy (MCD). Because of its high homology to carbohydrate sulfotransferases and the presence of mutations of this gene in MCD patients who lack sulfated keratan sulfate in the cornea and serum, hCGn6ST protein is thought to be a sulfotransferase that catalyzes sulfation of GlcNAc in keratan sulfate. In this report, we analyzed the enzymatic activity of hCGn6ST by expressing it in cultured cells. A lysate prepared from HeLa cells transfected with an intact form of hCGn6ST cDNA or culture medium from cells transfected with a secreted form of hCGn6ST cDNA showed an activity of transferring sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc of synthetic oligosaccharide substrates in vitro. When hCGn6ST was expressed together with human keratan sulfate Gal-6-sulfotransferase (hKSG6ST), HeLa cells produced highly sulfated carbohydrate detected by an anti-keratan sulfate antibody 5D4. These results indicate that hCGn6ST transfers sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc in keratan sulfate. Amino acid substitutions in hCGn6ST identical to changes resulting from missense mutations found in MCD patients abolished enzymatic activity. Moreover, mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase had the same activity as hCGn6ST. This observation suggests that mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase is the orthologue of hCGn6ST and functions as a sulfotransferase to produce keratan sulfate in the cornea.

11294830|t|A new spectrin, beta IV, has a major truncated isoform that associates with promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies and the nuclear matrix.
11294830|a|We isolated cDNAs that encode a 77-kDa peptide similar to repeats 10-16 of beta-spectrins. Its gene localizes to human chromosome 19q13.13-q13.2 and mouse chromosome 7, at 7.5 centimorgans. A 289-kDa isoform, similar to full-length beta-spectrins, was partially assembled from sequences in the human genomic DNA data base and completely cloned and sequenced. RNA transcripts are seen predominantly in the brain, and Western analysis shows a major peptide that migrates as a 72-kDa band. This new gene, spectrin betaIV, thus encodes a full-length minor isoform (SpbetaIVSigma1) and a truncated major isoform (SpbetaIVSigma5). Immunostaining of cells shows a micropunctate pattern in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In mesenchymal stem cells, the staining concentrates at nuclear dots that stain positively for the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Expression of SpbetaIVSigma5 fused to green fluorescence protein in cells produces nuclear dots that include all PML bodies, which double in number in transfected cells. Deletion analysis shows that partial repeats 10 and 16 of SpbetaIVSigma5 are necessary for nuclear dot formation. Immunostaining of whole-mount nuclear matrices reveals diffuse positivity with accentuation at PML bodies. Spectrin betaIV is the first beta-spectrin associated with a subnuclear structure and may be part of a nuclear scaffold to which gene regulatory machinery binds.

11311562|t|Identification and characterization of a human mitochondrial homologue of the bacterial co-chaperone GrpE.
11311562|a|We have identified a novel human cDNA with a predicted protein sequence that has 28% amino acid identity with the E. coli Hsp70 co-chaperone GrpE and designated it HMGE. Even with this low level of amino acid identity the human sequence could be efficiently modelled on the X-ray structure of the E. coli protein, suggesting that there may be significant functional conservation. Indeed, HMGE expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein co-purified with the E. coli Hsp70 protein DnaK in the absence of ATP. DnaK could be released from the GST-HMGE with a Mg-ATP wash. Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry studies using antisera raized against HMGE show that it is a mitochondrial protein. In contrast to studies of rat GrpE, however, HMGE also appears to bind the constitutive cytosolic Hsp70, Hsc70, in addition to mitochondrial Hsp70, Mt-Hsp70. We have previously shown that Hsc70 nucleotide-exchange is rate limiting in the presence of the DnaJ-protein, HSJ1b. However, HMGE was found to inhibit the HSJ1b-enhanced Hsc70 ATPase activity and may mediate this inhibition by binding the DnaJ-protein, HSJ1b. This is the first description of a direct interaction between a DnaJ protein and GrpE-like protein. These studies suggest that the structure of GrpE has been conserved throughout evolution and that the conserved structure can interact with several forms of Hsp70, but that HMGE cannot form part of the reaction cycle for cytosolic Hsc70.

11337487|t|Extensive repertoire of membrane-bound and soluble dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin 1 (DC-SIGN1) and DC-SIGN2 isoforms. Inter-individual variation in expression of DC-SIGN transcripts.
11337487|a|Expression in dendritic cells (DCs) of DC-SIGN, a type II membrane protein with a C-type lectin ectodomain, is thought to play an important role in establishing the initial contact between DCs and resting T cells. DC-SIGN is also a unique type of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) attachment factor and promotes efficient infection in trans of cells that express CD4 and chemokine receptors. We have identified another gene, designated here as DC-SIGN2, that exhibits high sequence homology with DC-SIGN. Here we demonstrate that alternative splicing of DC-SIGN1 (original version) and DC-SIGN2 pre-mRNA generates a large repertoire of DC-SIGN-like transcripts that are predicted to encode membrane-associated and soluble isoforms. The range of DC-SIGN1 mRNA expression was significantly broader than previously reported and included THP-1 monocytic cells, placenta, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and there was cell maturation/activation-induced differences in mRNA expression levels. Immunostaining of term placenta with a DC-SIGN1-specific antiserum showed that DC-SIGN1 is expressed on endothelial cells and CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)-positive macrophage-like cells in the villi. DC-SIGN2 mRNA expression was high in the placenta and not detectable in PBMCs. In DCs, the expression of DC-SIGN2 transcripts was significantly lower than that of DC-SIGN1. Notably, there was significant inter-individual heterogeneity in the repertoire of DC-SIGN1 and DC-SIGN2 transcripts expressed. The genes for DC-SIGN1, DC-SIGN2, and CD23, another Type II lectin, colocalize to an approximately 85 kilobase pair region on chromosome 19p13.3, forming a cluster of related genes that undergo highly complex alternative splicing events. The molecular diversity of DC-SIGN-1 and -2 is reminiscent of that observed for certain other adhesive cell surface proteins involved in cell-cell connectivity. The generation of this large collection of polymorphic cell surface and soluble variants that exhibit inter-individual variation in expression levels has important implications for the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, as well as for the molecular code required to establish complex interactions between antigen-presenting cells and T cells, i.e. the immunological synapse.

11342225|t|Identification of the human crooked neck gene by comparative gene identification.
11342225|a|Drosophila melanogaster serves as a useful model organism for functional genomic studies, and its genome project was recently completed. We previously described a comparative-gene-identification approach to assist human ortholog gene identification that involves applying an entire proteome as an alignment template. Analysis of the available 14100 Drosophila protein sequences revealed that 37% of them (5228 sequences) might lead to discoveries of novel human genes. Upon further database interrogations, we found several putative full-length human gene transcripts, including the human crooked neck (crn) gene. Based on sequence gap-closure experiments using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as well as bioinformatic analysis, we found that the assembled human cDNA contig of crooked neck gene was at least 3903 base pairs in length with alternative splicing variations which encoded mainly for a 687-amino-acid residue protein. The human crooked neck gene was located on chromosome 20 with at least 15 exons. The unique features of the 16 copies of the tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR) motif were conserved in the yeast, fly and human crooked neck orthologous proteins, which were important for spliceosome assembly in cells.

11342227|t|Identification of a novel fibroblast growth factor, FGF-22, preferentially expressed in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle.
11342227|a|We isolated cDNA encoding a novel fibroblast growth factor (FGF-22) (170 amino acids) from human placenta. Of the FGF family members, FGF-22, which appears to be a secreted protein, is most similar to FGF-10 and FGF-7 (approximately 46% and approximately 40% amino acid identities, respectively). The human FGF-22 gene was localized on chromosome 19p13.3. We also isolated mouse cDNA encoding FGF-22 (162 amino acids) from the skin. Mouse FGF-22 shows high homology (87% amino acid identity) to human FGF-22. Mouse FGF-22 mRNA was found to be preferentially expressed in the skin among the mouse adult tissues examined by Northern blotting analysis. By in situ hybridization, FGF-22 mRNA in the skin was found to be preferentially expressed in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle. Therefore, FGF-22 is expected to be a unique FGF that plays a role in hair development.

11350119|a|We report the isolation and initial characterization of a new member of the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit family, alpha10 (CHRNA10), from both inner-ear neuroepithelium and lymphoid tissue. The cDNA is 1959 nucleotides in length, with a coding region predicting a protein of 451 amino acids that is 90% identical to rat alpha10. The alpha10 gene was localized to chromosome 11p15.5. Human alpha10 was detected in human inner-ear tissue, tonsil, immortalized B-cells, cultured T-cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot hybridization, and immunohistochemistry.

11410164|t|Molecular cloning and preliminary functional analysis of two novel human KRAB zinc finger proteins, HKr18 and HKr19.
11410164|a|cDNA clones encoding two novel human KRAB zinc finger proteins, HKr18 and HKr19, were isolated from a human testis cDNA library. Their corresponding genes were later identified in sequences originating from chromosomes 19 and 7, respectively. On the basis of the collected information from gene and cDNA sequences, Hkr18 was found to be a protein of 94 kDa with 20 zinc finger motifs in its C terminus. The HKr19 is a smaller protein, with a molecular weight of 56 kDa containing 11 zinc finger motifs. Both HKr18 and HKr19 contained a KRAB A as well as a KRAB B domain in their N termini. Northern blot analysis showed expression of HKr18 in all human tissues tested, indicating a ubiquitous expression pattern. In contrast, HKr19 showed a more restricted tissue distribution, with detectable expression primarily in testis and fetal tissues. The HKr19 protein is a member of the large ZNF91 subfamily of KRAB zinc finger genes. A PCR-based analysis of the expression of HKr19 and other closely related genes showed that lymphoid, myeloid, and nonhematopoietic cells expressed different sets of these genes. This latter finding indicates that some members of the ZNF91 family may be involved in regulating lineage commitment during hematopoietic development. Transfection of various parts of HKr19 into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 cells) showed that the entire protein and its zinc finger region were toxic to these cells when expressed at high levels. In contrast, the KRAB domain and the linker region seemed to be well tolerated.

11463832|t|Negative regulation of protein translation by mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinases 1 and 2.
11463832|a|Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is a key component of the translational machinery and an important modulator of cell growth and proliferation. The activity of eIF4E is thought to be regulated by interaction with inhibitory binding proteins (4E-BPs) and phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-interacting kinase (MNK) on Ser209 in response to mitogens and cellular stress. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of eIF4E via MNK1 is mediated via the activation of either the Erk or p38 pathway. We further show that expression of active mutants of MNK1 and MNK2 in 293 cells diminishes cap-dependent translation relative to cap-independent translation in a transient reporter assay. The same effect on cap-dependent translation was observed when MNK1 was activated by the Erk or p38 pathway. In line with these findings, addition of recombinant active MNK1 to rabbit reticulocyte lysate resulted in a reduced protein synthesis in vitro, and overexpression of MNK2 caused a decreased rate of protein synthesis in 293 cells. By using CGP 57380, a novel low-molecular-weight kinase inhibitor of MNK1, we demonstrate that eIF4E phosphorylation is not crucial to the formation of the initiation complex, mitogen-stimulated increase in cap-dependent translation, and cell proliferation. Our results imply that activation of MNK by MAP kinase pathways does not constitute a positive regulatory mechanism to cap-dependent translation. Instead, we propose that the kinase activity of MNKs, eventually through phosphorylation of eIF4E, may serve to limit cap-dependent translation under physiological conditions.

11481447|t|A soluble class II cytokine receptor, IL-22RA2, is a naturally occurring IL-22 antagonist.
11481447|a|IL-22 is an IL-10 homologue that binds to and signals through the class II cytokine receptor heterodimer IL-22RA1/CRF2-4. IL-22 is produced by T cells and induces the production of acute-phase reactants in vitro and in vivo, suggesting its involvement in inflammation. Here we report the identification of a class II cytokine receptor designated IL-22RA2 (IL-22 receptor-alpha 2) that appears to be a naturally expressed soluble receptor. IL-22RA2 shares amino acid sequence homology with IL-22RA1 (also known as IL-22R, zcytor11, and CRF2-9) and is physically adjacent to IL-20Ralpha and IFN-gammaR1 on chromosome 6q23.3-24.2. We demonstrate that IL-22RA2 binds specifically to IL-22 and neutralizes IL-22-induced proliferation of BaF3 cells expressing IL-22 receptor subunits. IL-22RA2 mRNA is highly expressed in placenta and spleen by Northern blotting. PCR analysis using RNA from various tissues and cell lines showed that IL-22RA2 was expressed in a range of tissues, including those in the digestive, female reproductive, and immune systems. In situ hybridization revealed the dominant cell types expressing IL-22RA2 were mononuclear cells and epithelium. Because IL-22 induces the expression of acute phase reactants, IL-22RA2 may play an important role as an IL-22 antagonist in the regulation of inflammatory responses.

11545741|t|Two closely related human nuclear export factors utilize entirely distinct export pathways.
11545741|a|Nuclear mRNA export mediated by the human protein TAP requires a carboxy-terminal domain that directly interacts with components of the nuclear pore complex. Here we demonstrate that NXF3, a human RNA binding protein related to TAP, lacks this domain yet retains the ability to export tethered RNA transcripts and to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. NXF3 contains a novel Crm1-dependent nuclear export signal that compensates in cis for the loss of the nuclear pore targeting domain. NXF3-dependent RNA export is therefore blocked by Crm1-specific inhibitors that do not affect TAP function. Thus, while the related TAP and NXF3 proteins are both capable of mediating nuclear RNA export, they do so via unrelated export pathways.

11555636|t|Large-scale identification of mammalian proteins localized to nuclear sub-compartments.
11555636|a|Many nuclear components participating in related pathways appear concentrated in specific areas of the mammalian nucleus. The importance of this organization is attested to by the dysfunction that correlates with mis-localization of nuclear proteins in human disease and cancer. Determining the sub-nuclear localization of proteins is therefore important for understanding genome regulation and function, and it also provides clues to function for novel proteins. However, the complexity of proteins in the mammalian nucleus is too large to tackle this on a protein by protein basis. Large-scale approaches to determining protein function and sub-cellular localization are required. We have used a visual gene trap screen to identify more than 100 proteins, many of which are normal, located within compartments of the mouse nucleus. The most common discrete localizations detected are at the nucleolus and the splicing speckles and on chromosomes. Proteins at the nuclear periphery, or in other nuclear foci, have also been identified. Several of the proteins have been implicated in human disease or cancer, e.g. ATRX, HMGI-C, NBS1 and EWS, and the gene-trapped proteins provide a route into further understanding their function. We find that sequence motifs are often shared amongst proteins co-localized within the same sub-nuclear compartment. Conversely, some generally abundant motifs are lacking from the proteins concentrated in specific areas of the nucleus. This suggests that we may be able to predict sub-nuclear localization for proteins in databases based on their sequence.

11559747|t|CHMP1 is a novel nuclear matrix protein affecting chromatin structure and cell-cycle progression.
11559747|a|The Polycomb-group (PcG) is a diverse set of proteins required for maintenance of gene silencing during development. In a screen for conserved partners of the PcG protein Polycomblike (Pcl), we have identified a new protein, human CHMP1 (CHromatin Modifying Protein; CHarged Multivesicular body Protein), which is encoded by an alternative open reading frame in the PRSM1 gene and is conserved in both complex and simple eukaryotes. CHMP1 contains a predicted bipartite nuclear localization signal and distributes as distinct forms to the cytoplasm and the nuclear matrix in all cell lines tested. We have constructed a stable HEK293 cell line that inducibly overexpresses CHMP1 under ecdysone control. Overexpressed CHMP1 localizes to a punctate subnuclear pattern, encapsulating regions of nuclease-resistant, condensed chromatin. These novel structures are also frequently surrounded by increased histone H3 phosphorylation and acetylation. CHMP1 can recruit a PcG protein, BMI1, to these regions of condensed chromatin and can cooperate with co-expressed vertebrate Pcl in a Xenopus embryo PcG assay; this is consistent with a role in PcG function. In combination, these observations suggest that CHMP1 plays a role in stable gene silencing within the nucleus.

11559748|t|CHMP1 functions as a member of a newly defined family of vesicle trafficking proteins.
11559748|a|A multivesicular body is a vesicle-filled endosome that targets proteins to the interior of lysosomes. We have identified a conserved eukaryotic protein, human CHMP1, which is strongly implicated in multivesicular body formation. Immunocytochemistry and biochemical fractionation localize CHMP1 to early endosomes and CHMP1 physically interacts with SKD1/VPS4, a highly conserved protein directly linked to multivesicular body sorting in yeast. Similar to the action of a mutant SKD1 protein, overexpression of a fusion derivative of human CHMP1 dilates endosomal compartments and disrupts the normal distribution of several endosomal markers. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae further support a conserved role of CHMP1 in vesicle trafficking. Deletion of CHM1, the budding yeast homolog of CHMP1, results in defective sorting of carboxypeptidases S and Y and produces abnormal, multi-lamellar prevacuolar compartments. This phenotype classifies CHM1 as a member of the class E vacuolar protein sorting genes. Yeast Chm1p belongs to a structurally-related, but rather divergent family of proteins, including Vps24p and Snf7p and three novel proteins, Chm2p, Chm5p and Chm6p, which are all essential for multivesicular body sorting. These observations identify the conserved CHMP/Chmp family as a set of proteins fundamental to understanding multivesicular body sorting in eukaryotic organisms.

11566096|t|NXF5, a novel member of the nuclear RNA export factor family, is lost in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation.
11566096|a|Although X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) affects 2%-3% of the human population, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Recent interest in this topic led to the identification of several genes for which mutations result in the disturbance of cognitive development.   We identified a novel gene that is interrupted by an inv(X)(p21.1;q22) in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation. Molecular analysis of both breakpoint regions did not reveal an interrupted gene on Xp, but identified a novel nuclear RNA export factor (NXF) gene cluster, Xcen-NXF5-NXF2-NXF4-NXF3-Xqter, in which NXF5 is split by the breakpoint, leading to its functional nullisomy. The predicted NXF5 protein shows high similarity with the central part of the presumed mRNA nuclear export factor TAP/NXF1. Functional analysis of NXF5 demonstrates binding to RNA as well as to the RNA nuclear export-associated protein p15/NXT. In contrast to TAP/NXF1, overexpression studies localized NXF5 in the form of granules in the cell body and neurites of mature hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role in mRNA transport. The two newly identified mouse nxf homologs, nxf-a and nxf-b, which also map on X, show highest mRNA levels in the brain.   A novel member of the nuclear RNA export factor family is absent in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation. Although we did not find direct evidence for the involvement of NXF5 in MR, the gene could be involved in development, possibly through a process in mRNA metabolism in neurons.

11597136|t|Phylogenetic conservation of the makorin-2 gene, encoding a multiple zinc-finger protein, antisense to the RAF1 proto-oncogene.
11597136|a|Natural endogenous antisense RNAs have been reported in multiple loci, with evidence in some cases supporting a regulatory role for the antisense transcript. Here, we describe a novel gene, makorin RING zinc finger-2 (MKRN2), that overlaps and is antisense to the gene RAF1 in mammals. Phylogenetic analysis of the 3' untranslated region of RAF1 orthologues suggests that this relationship may have existed for up to 450 million years. We have also identified MKRN2 orthologues in two species of fish. This places the gene duplication event that created this locus from an ancestral MKRN1 gene early in vertebrate evolution, over 450 million years ago. Northern blot analyses show that human MKRN2 and RAF1 are co-expressed in tissues and cell lines, raising the possibility of mRNA duplex formation. The encoded makorin-2 protein is likely a ribonucleoprotein of unknown function, but its conservation suggests an important cellular role. The data presented here describe a conserved vertebrate MKRN2 gene that is closely associated with the RAF1 locus.

11641404|t|The p53 family member genes are involved in the Notch signal pathway.
11641404|a|The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth and death in response to environmental stimuli such as DNA damage. p63/p51 and p73 were recently identified as members of the p53 gene family. In contrast to p53 however, p63 and p73 are rarely mutated in human cancers. Mice that lack p53 are developmentally normal, while p63 and p73 appear to play critical roles in normal development. To determine how p63 and p73 are involved in normal development, we attempted to identify target genes that are specifically regulated by p63 and/or p73 but not by p53. We found that the Jagged1 (JAG1) and Jagged2 (JAG2) genes, encoding ligands for the Notch receptors, are up-regulated by p63 and p73. Furthermore, we identified a p63-binding site in the second intron of the JAG1 gene, which can directly interact with the p63 protein in vivo, as assessed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. A heterologous reporter assay revealed that this p63-binding site is a functional response element and is specific for p63. We also found a target of Notch signaling, HES-1 was up-regulated in Jurkat cells, in which Notch1 is highly expressed, when co-cultured with p63-transfected cells, suggesting that p63 can trigger the Notch signal pathway in neighboring cells. Our findings show an association between the p53 family genes and Notch signaling and suggest a potential molecular mechanism for the involvement of the p53 family genes in normal development.

11696592|t|Functional cloning of Src-like adapter protein-2 (SLAP-2), a novel inhibitor of antigen receptor signaling.
11696592|a|In an effort to identify novel therapeutic targets for autoimmunity and transplant rejection, we developed and performed a large-scale retroviral-based functional screen to select for proteins that inhibit antigen receptor-mediated activation of lymphocytes. In addition to known regulators of antigen receptor signaling, we identified a novel adaptor protein, SLAP-2 which shares 36% sequence similarity with the known Src-like adaptor protein, SLAP. Similar to SLAP, SLAP-2 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells. Overexpression of SLAP-2 in B and T cell lines specifically impaired antigen receptor-mediated signaling events, including CD69 surface marker upregulation, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) promoter activation and calcium influx. Signaling induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin was not significantly reduced, suggesting SLAP-2 functions proximally in the antigen receptor signaling cascade. The SLAP-2 protein contains an NH2-terminal myristoylation consensus sequence and SH3 and SH2 Src homology domains, but lacks a tyrosine kinase domain. In antigen receptor-stimulated cells, SLAP-2 associated with several tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, including the ubiquitin ligase Cbl. Deletion of the COOH terminus of SLAP-2 blocked function and abrogated its association with Cbl. Mutation of the putative myristoylation site of SLAP-2 compromised its inhibitory activity and impaired its localization to the membrane compartment. Our identification of the negative regulator SLAP-2 demonstrates that a retroviral-based screening strategy may be an efficient way to identify and characterize the function of key components of many signal transduction systems.

11698403|t|Composition of Drosophila melanogaster proteome involved in fucosylated glycan metabolism.
11698403|a|The whole genome approach enables the characterization of all components of any given biological pathway. Moreover, it can help to uncover all the metabolic routes for any molecule. Here we have used the genome of Drosophila melanogaster to search for enzymes involved in the metabolism of fucosylated glycans. Our results suggest that in the fruit fly GDP-fucose, the donor for fucosyltransferase reactions, is formed exclusively via the de novo pathway from GDP-mannose through enzymatic reactions catalyzed by GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose 3,5-epimerase/4-reductase (GMER, also known as FX in man). The Drosophila genome does not have orthologs for the salvage pathway enzymes, i.e. fucokinase and GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase synthesizing GDP-fucose from fucose. In addition we identified two novel fucosyltransferases predicted to catalyze alpha1,3- and alpha1,6-specific linkages to the GlcNAc residues on glycans. No genes with the capacity to encode alpha1,2-specific fucosyltransferases were found. We also identified two novel genes coding for O-fucosyltransferases and a gene responsible for a fucosidase enzyme in the Drosophila genome. Finally, using the Drosophila CG4435 gene, we identified two novel human genes putatively coding for fucosyltransferases. This work can serve as a basis for further whole-genome approaches in mapping all possible glycosylation pathways and as a basic analysis leading to subsequent experimental studies to verify the predictions made in this work.

11698418|t|Activation of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by a SAP-independent receptor of the CD2 family.
11698418|a|Some CD2 family receptors stimulate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through a signaling pathway, which is dependent on the recruitment of an adapter protein called SLAM-associated protein (SAP). In this work we identify a novel leukocyte cell surface receptor of the CD2 family called CD2-like receptor activating cytotoxic cells (CRACC). CRACC is expressed on cytotoxic lymphocytes, activated B cells, and mature dendritic cells, and activates NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Remarkably, although CRACC displays cytoplasmic motifs similar to those recruiting SAP, CRACC-mediated cytotoxicity occurs in the absence of SAP and requires activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2. Thus, CRACC is a unique CD2-like receptor which mediates NK cell activation through a SAP-independent extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated pathway.

11739631|t|FENS-1 and DFCP1 are FYVE domain-containing proteins with distinct functions in the endosomal and Golgi compartments.
11739631|a|FENS-1 and DFCP1 are recently discovered proteins containing one or two FYVE-domains respectively. We show that the FYVE domains in these proteins can bind PtdIns3P in vitro with high specificity over other phosphoinositides. Exogenously expressed FENS-1 localises to early endosomes: this localisation requires an intact FYVE domain and is sensitive to wortmannin inhibition. The isolated FYVE domain of FENS-1 also localises to endosomes. These results are consistent with current models of FYVE-domain function in this cellular compartment. By contrast, exogenously expressed DFCP1 displays a predominantly Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vesicular distribution with little or no overlap with FENS-1 or other endosomal markers. Overexpression of DFCP1 was found to cause dispersal of the Golgi compartment defined by giantin and gpp130-staining. Disruption of the FYVE domains of DFCP1 causes a shift to more condensed and compact Golgi structures and overexpression of this mutant was found to confer significant protection to the Golgi against brefeldin-induced dispersal. These properties of DFCP1 are surprising, and suggest FYVE domain-localisation and function may not be exclusively endosomal. Movies available on-line

11749039|t|Expression pattern in brain of TASK-1, TASK-3, and a tandem pore domain K(+) channel subunit, TASK-5, associated with the central auditory nervous system.
11749039|a|TWIK-related acid-sensitive K(+) (TASK) channels contribute to setting the resting potential of mammalian neurons and have recently been defined as molecular targets for extracellular protons and volatile anesthetics. We have isolated a novel member of this subfamily, hTASK-5, from a human genomic library and mapped it to chromosomal region 20q12-20q13. hTASK-5 did not functionally express in Xenopus oocytes, whereas chimeric TASK-5/TASK-3 constructs containing the region between M1 and M3 of TASK-3 produced K(+) selective currents. To better correlate TASK subunits with native K(+) currents in neurons the precise cellular distribution of all TASK family members was elucidated in rat brain. A comprehensive in situ hybridization analysis revealed that both TASK-1 and TASK-3 transcripts are most strongly expressed in many neurons likely to be cholinergic, serotonergic, or noradrenergic. In contrast, TASK-5 expression is found in olfactory bulb mitral cells and Purkinje cells, but predominantly associated with the central auditory pathway. Thus, TASK-5 K(+) channels, possibly in conjunction with auxiliary proteins, may play a role in the transmission of temporal information in the auditory system.

11750132|t|Identification of two novel human dynein light chain genes, DNLC2A and DNLC2B, and their expression changes in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from 68 Chinese patients.
11750132|a|Two full-length cDNAs, DNLC2A and DNLC2B, were cloned and characterized. Their open reading frames respectively encode 96 amino acids which are most closely homologous to roadblock/LC7, one member of an ancient dynein light chain protein family, conserved in nematode, fruit fly, mouse and rat. The DNLC2A was expressed in 12 of 16 human tissues examined, with especially strong expression in heart, liver and brain, whereas there was weak expression in lung, prostate, testis, small intestine and colon. The expression of DNLC2B was generally high compared with that of DNLC2A except in liver. Northern blotting and/or semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis examined the expression changes of DNLC2A and DNLC2B in 68 hepatocellular carcinoma tissue samples. It was revealed that DNLC2A was up-regulated (45 out of the 68 cases) while DNLC2B was down-regulated (44 out of 68 cases), compared with their adjacent tumor-free liver tissues. Interestingly, among the total 68 liver cancer samples tested, DNLC2A was up-regulated while DNLC2B was down-regulated in 28 cases; DNLC2A was up-regulated while no obvious change was observed for DNLC2B in 10 cases; no obvious change was observed for DNLC2A while DNLC2B was down-regulated in 14 cases. Although the underlying mechanism is not clear to date, the apparent up-regulation of DNLC2A and down-regulation of DNLC2B suggest that these genes might be involved in tumor progression. On the other hand, the different expression changes of the two homologous genes indicate that hepatocellular carcinomas are caused by different pathological mechanisms. In addition, DNLC2A was assigned to human chromosome 20q12-q13.11 near the marker D20S106 by radiation hybrid mapping.

11781389|t|Identification of human CD93 as the phagocytic C1q receptor (C1qRp) by expression cloning.
11781389|a|CD93 is a approximately 120 kDa O-sialoglycoprotein that within the hematopoietic system is selectively expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage. So far, its primary structure and function were unknown. We used retroviral-expression cloning to isolate the CD93 cDNA. Sequence analysis revealed that CD93 is identical to a protein on human phagocytes termed C1q receptor (C1qRp). C1qRp was shown previously to mediate enhancement of phagocytosis in monocytes and was suggested to be a receptor of C1q and two other structurally related molecules. When studying CD93 transductants and control cells, we found that cells expressing CD93 have enhanced capacity to bind C1q. Furthermore, we show that immature dendritic cells (DC) express CD93/C1qRp, and mature DC, known to have reduced capacity for antigen uptake and to have lost the ability to phagocytose, show weak-to-negative CD93/C1qRp expression.

11802771|t|A novel immunoglobulin superfamily receptor (19A) related to CD2 is expressed on activated lymphocytes and promotes homotypic B-cell adhesion.
11802771|a|A novel lymphocyte-specific immunoglobulin superfamily protein (19A) has been cloned. The predicted 335-amino-acid sequence of 19A represents a Type 1 membrane protein with homology with the CD2 family of receptors. A molecular model of the two predicted extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains of 19A has been generated using the crystal structure of CD2 as a template. In isolated lymphocytes, expression of 19A is induced by various activation stimuli, and enforced expression of the 19A gene promotes homotypic cell adhesion in a B-cell-line model. Collectively these data imply that the 19A protein plays a role in regulation of lymphocyte adhesion.

11804589|a|We show that matrices carrying the tethered homologs of natural phosphoinositides can be used to capture and display multiple phosphoinositide binding proteins in cell and tissue extracts. We present the mass spectrometric identification of over 20 proteins isolated by this method, mostly from leukocyte extracts: they include known and novel proteins with established phosphoinositide binding domains and also known proteins with surprising and unusual phosphoinositide binding properties. One of the novel PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding proteins, ARAP3, has an unusual domain structure, including five predicted PH domains. We show that it is a specific PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/PtdIns(3,4)P2-stimulated Arf6 GAP both in vitro and in vivo, and both its Arf GAP and Rho GAP domains cooperate in mediating PI3K-dependent rearrangements in the cell cytoskeleton and cell shape.

11854288|t|The telomeric poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, tankyrase 1, contains multiple binding sites for telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) and a novel acceptor, 182-kDa tankyrase-binding protein (TAB182).
11854288|a|Tankyrase 1, a human telomeric poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, was originally identified through its interaction with TRF1, a negative regulator of telomere length. Tankyrase 1 ADP-ribosylates TRF1 in vitro, and its overexpression induces telomere elongation in human cancer cells. In addition to its telomeric localization, tankyrase 1 resides at multiple subcellular sites, suggesting additional functions for this protein. Here we identify TAB182, a novel tankyrase 1-binding protein of 182 kDa. TAB182 displays a complex pattern of subcellular localization. TAB182 localizes to the nucleus in a heterochromatic staining pattern and to the cytoplasm, where it co-stains with the cortical actin network. TAB182 coimmunoprecipitates with tankyrase 1 from human cells and serves as an acceptor of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by tankyrase 1 in vitro. Like TRF1, TAB182 binds to the ankyrin domain (comprising 24 ankyrin repeats) of tankyrase 1. Surprisingly, dissection of this domain reveals multiple discrete and overlapping binding sites for TRF1 and TAB182. Thus, we demonstrate five well conserved ankyrin repeat clusters in tankyrase 1. Although each of the five ankyrin repeat clusters independently binds to TRF1, only three of the five bind toTAB182. These findings suggest that tankyrase 1 may act as a scaffold for large molecular mass complexes made up of multiple binding proteins. We discuss potential roles for tankyrase 1-mediated higher order complexes at telomeres and at other subcellular sites.

11891219|t|A novel Src homology 2 domain-containing molecule, Src-like adapter protein-2 (SLAP-2), which negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling.
11891219|a|We have cloned a novel adapter protein containing Src homology 2 and Src homology 3 domains similar to the Src family of tyrosine kinases. This molecule lacks a catalytic tyrosine kinase domain and is related to a previously identified protein, Src-like adapter protein (SLAP), and is therefore designated SLAP-2. Northern blot analysis indicates that SLAP-2 is predominantly expressed in the immune system. Jurkat T cells express SLAP-2 protein and overexpression of SLAP-2 in these cells negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling as assessed by interleukin-2 promoter or NF-AT promoter reporter constructs. Mutational analysis revealed that an intact SH2 domain of SLAP-2 is essential for this inhibitory effect, whereas mutation of the SH3 domain alone has no effect. This inhibitory effect is upstream of the activation of Ras and increase of intracellular calcium levels, as no inhibition was observed when the cells were activated by phorbol ester plus ionomycin. SLAP-2 interacts with Cbl in vivo in a phosphorylation independent manner and with ZAP-70 and T cell receptor zeta chain upon T cell receptor activation. Finally, we show that the mutation of a predicted myristoylation site within the NH(2)-terminal of SLAP-2 is essential for its inhibitory effect. This report therefore implicates SLAP and SLAP-2 as a family of adapter proteins that negatively regulate T cell receptor signaling.

11895476|t|Isolation and characterization of a new nucleolar protein, Nrap, that is conserved from yeast to humans.
11895476|a|The nucleolus is the site of rRNA synthesis and processing in eukaryotic cells, but its composition remains poorly understood.   We have identified a novel nucleolar RNA-associated protein (Nrap) which is highly conserved from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to human, with homologues in mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and other species. In the mouse, we have found that Nrap is ubiquitously expressed and is specifically localized in the nucleolus. We have also identified splice variants in human and mouse, and defined the intron-exon structure of the human Nrap gene. Nrap is inherited into daughter nuclei by associating with the condensed chromosomes during mitosis. RNase treatment of permeabilized cells indicated that the nucleolar localization of Nrap is RNA dependent. The effects of actinomycin D, cycloheximide and 5,6-dichloro-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole on Nrap expression and distribution in cultured cells suggest that Nrap is associated with the pre-rRNA transcript.   Nrap is a large nucleolar protein (of more than 1000 amino acids), and is a new class of protein with new structural and functional motifs. Nrap appears to be associated with ribosome biogenesis by interacting with pre-rRNA primary transcript.

11897791|t|Identification of the mitochondrial glutamate transporter. Bacterial expression, reconstitution, functional characterization, and tissue distribution of two human isoforms.
11897791|a|The mitochondrial carriers are a family of transport proteins in the inner membranes of mitochondria. They shuttle substrates, metabolites, and cofactors through this membrane and connect cytoplasm functions with others in the matrix. Glutamate is co-transported with H(+) (or exchanged for OH(-)), but no protein has ever been associated with this activity. Two human expressed sequence tags encode proteins of 323 and 315 amino acids with 63% identity that are related to the aspartate-glutamate carrier, a member of the carrier family. They have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. Their transport properties demonstrate that the two proteins are isoforms of the glutamate/H(+) symporter described in the past in whole mitochondria. Isoform 1 is expressed at higher levels than isoform 2 in all the tissues except in brain, where the two isoforms are expressed at comparable levels. The differences in expression levels and kinetic parameters of the two isoforms suggest that isoform 2 matches the basic requirement of all tissues especially with respect to amino acid degradation, and isoform 1 becomes operative to accommodate higher demands associated with specific metabolic functions such as ureogenesis.

11909966|t|Identification of mammalian Sds3 as an integral component of the Sin3/histone deacetylase corepressor complex.
11909966|a|Silencing of gene transcription involves local chromatin modification achieved through the local recruitment of large multiprotein complexes containing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. The mammalian corepressors mSin3A and mSin3B have been shown to play a key role in this process by tethering HDACs 1 and 2 to promoter-bound transcription factors. Similar mechanisms appear to be operative in yeast, in which epistasis experiments have established that the mSin3 and HDAC orthologs (SIN3 and RPD3), along with a novel protein, SDS3, function in the same repressor pathway. Here, we report the identification of a component of the mSin3-HDAC complex that bears homology to yeast SDS3, physically associates with mSin3 proteins in vivo, represses transcription in a manner that is partially dependent on HDAC activity, and enables HDAC1 catalytic activity in vivo. That key physical and functional properties are also shared by yeast SDS3 underscores the central role of the Sin3-HDAC-Sds3 complex in eukaryotic cell biology, and the discovery of mSds3 in mammalian cells provides a new avenue for modulating the activity of this complex in human disease.

11955620|t|Isolation of a genomic clone containing the promoter region of the human ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCB6.
11955620|a|We previously reported on the isolation of a new rat ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCB6. We now report the isolation of the full-length cDNA and genomic clones containing the human ABCB6 gene. ABCB6 is 100% identical to the cloned MTABC3 human ABC transporter and contains the typical ABC signature, Walker A and B motifs. We found that HuABCB6 is expressed at low levels in normal human liver. We found that ABCB6 was overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinomas compared to paired surrounding non-malignant tissue. We found that there was no difference in ABCB6 gene copy between human liver cancer and its paired non-malignant tissue. Because HuABCB6 was overexpressed in human cancers compared to peri-tumoral tissue in the absence of gene amplification, transcriptional regulation may play an important role in its expression. Therefore, we isolated a 14 kb genomic DNA clone containing the HuABCB6 promoter and 5'-flanking region. The 5'-flanking region contains a CpG island, lacks an appropriately positioned TATA element and contains a number of putative transcription factor binding sites. Two transcription start sites were identified by S1 nuclease mapping at -274 and -296 bp from the start codon. Transient transfection of the HuABCB6 promoter constructs (HuABCB6/1.68, 1.39, 1.13, 0.90, 0.52) containing the luciferase reporter gene resulted in a 1100-2300-fold increase in luciferase activity compared to the empty vector control whereas HuABCB6/1.68 subcloned in the reverse orientation resulted in no activity. We observed a significant decrease in luciferase activity with the promoter constructs, HuABCB6/0.25, 0.15 and 0.06, which indicates that an orientation-dependent functional promoter is contained within our previously predicted promoter region of -315 bp to -565 bp as deletion of this 250 bp sequence resulted in a loss of promoter activity.

11980910|t|Mirk protein kinase is activated by MKK3 and functions as a transcriptional activator of HNF1alpha.
11980910|a|Mirk/Dyrk1B is an arginine-directed serine/threonine protein kinase that is expressed at low levels in most normal tissues but at elevated levels in many tumor cell lines and in normal skeletal muscle. Colon carcinoma cell lines stably overexpressing Mirk proliferated in serum-free medium, but the mechanism of Mirk action is unknown. DCoHm (dimerization cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha ( HNF1alpha) from muscle), a novel gene of the DCoH family with 78% amino acid identity to DCoH, was identified as a Mirk-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid analysis and cloned. Mirk co-immunoprecipitated with DCoHm and bound to DCoHm in glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. DCoH stabilizes HNF1alpha as a dimer and enhances its transcriptional activity on the beta-fibrinogen promoter reporter, and DCoHm had similar activity. Mirk enhanced HNF1alpha transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas two kinase-inactive Mirk mutants and a Mirk N-terminal deletion mutant did not. Mirk, DCoHm, and HNF1alpha formed a complex. Mirk bound to a specific region within the CREB-binding protein-binding region of HNF1alpha and phosphorylated HNF1alpha at a site adjacent to the Mirk-binding region. Conversely, the HNF1alpha binding domain was located within the first five conserved kinase subdomains of Mirk. Mirk co-immunoprecipitated with the MAPK kinase MKK3, an upstream activator of p38. MKK3 enhanced Mirk kinase activity and the transcriptional activation of HNF1alpha by Mirk, suggesting that Mirk, like p38, is activated by certain environmental stress agents. The Mirk-binding protein DCoH has been shown to be selectively expressed in colon carcinomas but not in normal tissue. Mirk may function as an HNF1alpha transcriptional activator in response to an MKK3-mediated stress signal, and the selective expression of DCoH could restrict the Mirk response to carcinoma cells.

11994479|t|Human C1qRp is identical with CD93 and the mNI-11 antigen but does not bind C1q.
11994479|a|It has been suggested that the human C1qRp is a receptor for the complement component C1q; however, there is no direct evidence for an interaction between C1q and C1qRp. In this study, we demonstrate that C1q does not show enhanced binding to C1qRp-transfected cells compared with control cells. Furthermore, a soluble recombinant C1qRp-Fc chimera failed to interact with immobilized C1q. The proposed role of C1qRp in the phagocytic response in vivo is also unsupported in that we demonstrate that this molecule is not expressed by macrophages in a variety of human tissues and the predominant site of expression is on endothelial cells. Studies on the rodent homolog of C1qRp, known as AA4, have suggested that this molecule may function as an intercellular adhesion molecule. Here we show that C1qRp is the Ag recognized by several previously described mAbs, mNI-11 and two anti-CD93 Abs (clones X2 and VIMD2b). Interestingly, mNI-11 (Fab') has been shown to promote monocyte-monocyte and monocyte-endothelial cell adhesive interactions. We produced a recombinant C1qRp-Fc chimera containing the C-type lectin-like domain of C1qRp and found specific binding to vascular endothelial cells in sections of inflamed human tonsil, indicating the presence of a C1qRp ligand at this site. This interaction was Ca(2+) independent and was not blocked by our anti-C1qRp mAb BIIG-4, but was blocked by the proadhesive mAb mNI-11. Collectively, these data indicate that C1qRp is not a receptor for C1q, and they support the emerging role of C1qRp (here renamed CD93) in functions relevant to intercellular adhesion.

11997512|t|Paip1 interacts with poly(A) binding protein through two independent binding motifs.
11997512|a|The 3' poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNAs plays an important role in the regulation of translation. The poly(A) binding protein (PABP) interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), a component of the eIF4F complex, which binds to the 5' cap structure. The PABP-eIF4G interaction brings about the circularization of the mRNA by joining its 5' and 3' termini, thereby stimulating mRNA translation. The activity of PABP is regulated by two interacting proteins, Paip1 and Paip2. To study the mechanism of the Paip1-PABP interaction, far-Western, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, and surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed. Paip1 contains two binding sites for PABP, PAM1 and PAM2 (for PABP-interacting motifs 1 and 2). PAM2 consists of a 15-amino-acid stretch residing in the N terminus, and PAM1 encompasses a larger C-terminal acidic-amino-acid-rich region. PABP also contains two Paip1 binding sites, one located in RNA recognition motifs 1 and 2 and the other located in the C-terminal domain. Paip1 binds to PABP with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an apparent K(d) of 1.9 nM.

12027893|t|Human sprouty 4, a new ras antagonist on 5q31, interacts with the dual specificity kinase TESK1.
12027893|a|The Drosophila melanogaster protein sprouty is induced upon fibroblast growth factor (FGF)- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor tyrosine kinase activation and acts as an inhibitor of the ras/MAP kinase pathway downstream of these receptors. By differential display RT-PCR of activated vs. resting umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) we detected a new human sprouty gene, which we designated human sprouty 4 (hspry4) based on its homology with murine sprouty 4. Hspry4 is widely expressed and Northern blots indicate that different isoforms of hspry4 are induced upon cellular activation. The hspry4 gene maps to 5q31.3. It encodes a protein of 322 amino acids, which, in support of a modulating role in signal transduction, contains a prototypic cysteine-rich region, three, potentially Src homology 3 (SH3) binding, proline-rich regions and a PEST sequence. This new sprouty orthologue can suppress the insulin- and EGF-receptor transduced MAP kinase signaling pathway, but fails to inhibit MAP kinase activation by constitutively active V12 ras. Hspry4 appears to impair the formation of active GTP-ras and exert its activity at the level of wild-type ras or upstream thereof. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, using hspry4 as bait, testicular protein kinase 1 (TESK1) was identified from a human fetal liver cDNA library as a partner of hspry4. The hspry4-TESK1 interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments and increases by growth factor stimulation. The two proteins colocalize in apparent cytoplasmic vesicles and do not show substantial translocation to the plasma membrane upon receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation.

12065586|t|Identification and characterization of Gemin7, a novel component of the survival of motor neuron complex.
12065586|a|The survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein is the product of the gene mutated or deleted in the neurodegenerative disease, spinal muscular atrophy. SMN is part of a large macromolecular complex that also contains Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4, Gemin5, and Gemin6. The SMN complex functions in the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and probably other ribonucleoprotein particles. We have identified a novel protein component of the SMN complex termed Gemin7 using native purified SMN complexes and peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunolocalization experiments demonstrate that Gemin7 is a component of the SMN complex and colocalizes with SMN in the cytoplasm and in gems. Binding experiments show that Gemin7 interacts directly with SMN and Gemin6 and mediates the association of Gemin6 with the SMN complex. The amino acid sequence of Gemin7 does not contain any recognizable motifs with the exception of several arginine and glycine repeats that are necessary for its interaction with SMN. Moreover, Gemin7 interacts with several Sm proteins of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, in particular, with SmE. With the identification of Gemin7, the inventory of the core components of the SMN complex appears essentially complete.

12093742|t|FANCE: the link between Fanconi anaemia complex assembly and activity.
12093742|a|The Fanconi anaemia (FA) nuclear complex (composed of the FA proteins A, C, G and F) is essential for protection against chromosome breakage. It activates the downstream protein FANCD2 by monoubiquitylation; this then forges an association with the BRCA1 protein at sites of DNA damage. Here we show that the recently identified FANCE protein is part of this nuclear complex, binding both FANCC and FANCD2. Indeed, FANCE is required for the nuclear accumulation of FANCC and provides a critical bridge between the FA complex and FANCD2. Disease-associated FANCC mutants do not bind to FANCE, cannot accumulate in the nucleus and are unable to prevent chromosome breakage.

12101391|t|Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 cleavage during apoptosis: an update.
12101391|a|Poly(ADP-ribosylation) is a post-translational modification of proteins playing a crucial role in many processes, including DNA repair and cell death. The best known poly(ADP-ribosylating) enzyme, PARP-1, is a DNA nick sensor and uses betaNAD(+) to form polymers of ADP-ribose which are further bound to nuclear protein acceptors. To strictly regulate poly(ADP-ribose) turnover, its degradation is assured by the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). During apoptosis, PARP-1 plays two opposite roles: its stimulation leads to poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis, whereas caspases cause PARP-1 cleavage and inactivation. PARP-1 proteolysis produces an 89 kDa C-terminal fragment, with a reduced catalytic activity, and a 24 kDa N-terminal peptide, which retains the DNA binding domains. The fate and the possible role of these fragments during apoptosis will be discussed.

12106695|t|Molecular, functional, and genomic characterization of human KCC2, the neuronal K-Cl cotransporter.
12106695|a|The expression level of the neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 (SLC12A5) is a major determinant of whether neurons will respond to GABA with a depolarizing, excitatory response or a hyperpolarizing, inhibitory response. In view of the potential role in human neuronal excitability we have characterized the hKCC2 cDNA and gene. The 5.9 kb hKCC2 transcript is specific to brain, and is induced during in vitro differentiation of NT2 teratocarcinoma cells into neuronal NT2-N cells. The 24-exon SLC12A5 gene is on human chromosome 20q13, and contains a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat within intron 1 near a potential binding site for neuron-restrictive silencing factor. Expression of hKCC2 cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes results in significant Cl(-)-dependent (86)Rb(+) uptake under isotonic conditions; cell swelling under hypotonic conditions causes a 20-fold activation, which is blocked by the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin-A. In contrast, oocytes expressing mouse KCC4 do not mediate isotonic K-Cl cotransport but express much higher absolute transport activity than KCC2 oocytes under hypotonic conditions. Initial and steady state kinetics of hKCC2-injected oocytes were performed in both isotonic and hypotonic conditions, revealing K(m)s for K(+) and Cl(-) of 9.3+/-1.8 mM and 6.8+/-0.9 mM, respectively; both affinities are significantly higher than KCC1 and KCC4. The K(m) for Cl(-) is close to the intracellular Cl(-) activity of mature neurons, as befits a neuronal efflux mechanism.   Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

12119107|t|Human aminopeptidase B (rnpep) on chromosome 1q32.2: complementary DNA, genomic structure and expression.
12119107|a|Aminopeptidase B (APB) is a Zn(2+)-metalloexopeptidase, which selectively removes Arg and/or Lys residues from the N-terminus of several peptide substrates. Several data strongly support the hypothesis that this enzyme could participate in the final stages of precursor processing mechanisms and/or in particular inflammatory processes and tumor developments. Therefore, we have cloned the complementary DNA encoding the human APB, a 658-residues protein, containing the canonical "HEXXH(X(18))E", a signature allowing its classification in the M1 family of metallopeptidases. The genomic structure of the human APB gene (rnpep; 1q32.1-q32.2) was also determined. rnpep is bracketed by pre-protein translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane gene and ETS family transcription factor ELF3 gene. It spans more than 24 kbp and contains 11 exons ranging from 109 to 574 bp. Finally, expression of the human APB messenger RNA (mRNA) was investigated using a pre-made dot-blot. This mRNA seems to be ubiquitous although its expression level varies depending of the cells or tissues considered.

12140175|t|Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation attenuates beta-lapachone-induced necrotic cell death in human osteosarcoma cells.
12140175|a|beta-Lapachone, a novel anticancer drug, induces various human carcinoma cells to undergo apoptotic cell death. However, we report here that, in human osteocarcinoma (U2-OS) cells, beta-lapachone induces necrosis rather than apoptosis. beta-Lapachone-induced necrotic cell death in U2-OS cells was characterized by propidium iodide uptake, cytochrome c release, a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP depletion. The mitochondrial potential transition (MPT), including the reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, occurred in beta-lapachone-treated cells; cotreatment of these cells with cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of MPT pore, failed to prevent necrotic cell death. This indicates that the MPT transition does not play a crucial role in this process. Furthermore, beta-lapachone-induced necrosis was independent of oxidative stress and caspase activation. However, excessive poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation and subsequent depletion of intracellular NAD(+) and ATP were seen in beta-lapachone-treated U2-OS cells. Cotreatment with a PARP inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, decreased beta-lapachone-induced PARP activation and provided significant protection from necrosis by preventing depletion of intracellular NAD(+) and ATP. Taken together, our results suggest that PARP plays an important role in the signaling pathway for beta-lapachone-induced necrosis in U2-OS cells.

12192048|t|Enzymes of the SUMO modification pathway localize to filaments of the nuclear pore complex.
12192048|a|SUMOs are small ubiquitin-related polypeptides that are reversibly conjugated to many nuclear proteins. Although the number of identified substrates has grown rapidly, relatively little is still understood about when, where, and why most proteins are modified by SUMO. Here, we demonstrate that enzymes involved in the SUMO modification and demodification of proteins are components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We show that SENP2, a SUMO protease that is able to demodify both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 protein conjugates, localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC. The unique amino-terminal domain of SENP2 interacts with the FG repeat domain of Nup153, indicating that SENP2 associates with the nucleoplasmic basket of the NPC. We also investigated the localization of the SUMO conjugating enzyme, Ubc9. Using immunogold labeling of isolated nuclear envelopes, we found that Ubc9 localizes to both the cytoplasmic and the nucleoplasmic filaments of the NPC. In vitro binding studies revealed that Ubc9 and SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 bind synergistically to form a trimeric complex with a component of the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC, Nup358. Our results indicate that both SUMO modification and demodification of proteins may occur at the NPC and suggest a connection between the SUMO modification pathway and nucleocytoplasmic transport.

12218053|t|A coregulatory role for the TRAP-mediator complex in androgen receptor-mediated gene expression.
12218053|a|The human thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein (TRAP)-Mediator complex was originally identified as a large multimeric complex that copurifies with the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) from HeLa cells and markedly enhances TR-mediated transcription in vitro. More recent studies have implicated TRAP-Mediator as a coactivator for a broad range of nuclear hormone receptors as well as other classes of transcriptional activators. Here we present evidence that TRAP-Mediator plays a functional role in androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcription. We show that several subunits of the complex ligand-dependently coimmunoprecipitate with AR from both prostate cancer LNCaP cells and from HeLa cells stably transfected with AR. The 220-kDa subunit of the complex (TRAP220) can contact the ligand-binding domain of AR in vitro, possibly implicating TRAP220 involvement in targeting AR to the holocomplex. Consistent with a TRAP-Mediator coactivator role, transient overexpression of the TRAP220, TRAP170, and TRAP100 subunits enhanced ligand-dependent transcription by AR in cultured cells. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that TRAP220 is recruited to the androgen-responsive prostate-specific antigen gene promoter in vivo in ligand-stimulated LNCaP cells. Collectively, these data suggest that TRAP-Mediator may play an important coregulatory role in AR-mediated gene expression.

12270937|t|Role of TRAF3 and -6 in the activation of the NF-kappa B and JNK pathways by X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor.
12270937|a|X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that has been shown to be highly expressed in ectodermal derivatives during embryonic development and binds to ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). By using a subclone of 293F cells with stable expression of XEDAR, we report that XEDAR activates the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. Treatment with EDA-A2 leads to the recruitment of TRAF3 and -6 to the aggregated XEDAR complex, suggesting a central role of these adaptors in the proximal aspect of XEDAR signaling. Whereas TRAF3 and -6, IKK1/IKKalpha, IKK2/IKKbeta, and NEMO/IKKgamma are involved in XEDAR-induced NF-kappaB activation, XEDAR-induced JNK activation seems to be mediated via a pathway dependent on TRAF3, TRAF6, and ASK1. Deletion and point mutagenesis studies delineate two distinct regions in the cytoplasmic domain of XEDAR, which are involved in binding to TRAF3 and -6, respectively, and play a major role in the activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Taken together, our results establish a major role of TRAF3 and -6 in XEDAR signaling and in the process of ectodermal differentiation.

12397388|t|K+ channel activation by all three isoforms of serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent protein kinase SGK.
12397388|a|The serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase SGK1 was originally identified as a glucocorticoid-sensitive gene. Subsequently, the two homologous kinases SGK2 and SGK3 have been cloned, being products of distinct genes, which are differentially expressed and share 80% identity in amino acid sequence in their catalytic domains. While SGK1 has been shown to activate ion channels, including K(+) channels, the functions of SGK2 and SGK3 have not been examined. The present study was therefore performed to elucidate the effect of SGK1, SGK2, and SGK3 on electrical properties of renal epithelial cells. To this end human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were transfected with the kinases and ion-channel activity determined using the patch-clamp technique. In non-transfected cells and in cells transfected with the empty GFP construct a voltage-gated K(+) current was observed amounting to 303+/-19 pA ( n=13) and 299+/-29 pA ( n=23), respectively. Transfection with SGK1, SGK2 or SGK3 increased the voltage-gated K(+) current to 1056+/-152 pA ( n=17), 555+/-47 pA ( n=17), and 775+/-98 pA ( n=16), respectively. The K(+) current was fully blocked by 3 mM tetraethylammonium chloride and inhibited 45% by the Kv1 channel blocker margatoxin (10 nM). In dual electrode voltage-clamp experiments SGK isoforms up-regulated Kv1 voltage-gated K(+)channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The present observations thus reveal a powerful stimulating effect of all three isoforms of SGK on K(+) channels. Those effects may participate in regulation of epithelial transport, cell proliferation, and neuromuscular excitability.

12445808|t|Physical interaction between hepatitis C virus NS4B protein and CREB-RP/ATF6beta.
12445808|a|By using a yeast two-hybrid assay, cyclic AMP-response-element-binding protein-related protein (CREB-RP), also called activating transcription factor 6beta (ATF6beta), was identified as a cellular protein that interacts with the NS4B protein of hepatitis C virus. An N-terminal half of NS4B and a central portion of CREB-RP/ATF6beta containing the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain were involved in the interaction. The interaction between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta was demonstrated also in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analyses using specific antibodies. The bZIP domain of ATF6alpha, which shares high sequence similarity with CREB-RP/ATF6beta, was also shown to interact with NS4B in yeast although the interaction was weaker than that between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta. CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha are known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced transcription factors. Collectively, our results imply the possibility that NS4B modulates certain cellular responses upon ER stress through the physical interaction with CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha.

12446779|t|A C-terminal inhibitory domain controls the activity of p63 by an intramolecular mechanism.
12446779|a|The human genome is far smaller than originally estimated, and one explanation is that alternative splicing creates greater proteomic complexity than a simple count of open reading frames would suggest. The p53 homologue p63, for example, is a tetrameric transcription factor implicated in epithelial development and expressed as at least six isoforms with widely differing transactivation potential. In particular, p63alpha isoforms contain a 27-kDa C-terminal region that drastically reduces their activity and is of clear biological importance, since patients with deletions in this C terminus have phenotypes very similar to patients with mutations in the DNA-binding domain. We have identified a novel domain within this C terminus that is necessary and sufficient for transcriptional inhibition and which acts by binding to a region in the N-terminal transactivation domain of p63 homologous to the MDM2 binding site in p53. Based on this mechanism, we provide a model that explains the transactivation potential of homo- and heterotetramers composed of different p63 isoforms and their effect on p53.

12446784|t|Complex transcriptional effects of p63 isoforms: identification of novel activation and repression domains.
12446784|a|p63 is a transcription factor structurally related to the p53 tumor suppressor. The C-terminal region differs from p53's in that it contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain and is subject to multiple alternative splicings. The N-terminal region is present in the transactivation (TA) and DeltaN configurations, with the latter lacking the transcriptional activation domain 1. Single amino acid substitutions and frameshift mutations of p63 cause the human ankyloblepharon ectodermal dysplasia clefting (AEC) or ectrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia and facial clefting (EEC) syndromes. We have systematically compared the activities of the wild-type p63 isoforms and of the natural mutants in activation and repression assays on three promoters modulated by p53. We found that p63 proteins with an altered SAM domain or no SAM domain-the beta isoforms, the EEC frameshift mutant, and the missense AEC mutations-all showed a distinctly higher level of activation of the MDM2 promoter and decreased repression on the HSP70 promoter. Fusion of SAM to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain repressed a heterologous promoter. A second activation domain, TA2, corresponding to exons 11 to 12, was uncovered by comparing the activation of DeltaN isoforms on natural promoters and in GAL4 fusion systems. In colony formation assays, the AEC mutants, but not the EEC frameshift, were consistently less efficient in suppressing growth, in both the TA version and the DeltaN version, with respect to their p63alpha counterparts. These data highlight the modularity of p63, identifying the SAM domain as a dominant transcriptional repression module and indicating that the AEC and EEC frameshift mutants are characterized by a subversion of the p63 transcriptional potential.

12466223|t|Nociceptive sensitization by the secretory protein Bv8.
12466223|a|1 The small protein Bv8, isolated from amphibian skin, belongs to a novel family of secretory proteins (Bv8-Prokineticin family, SWISS-PROT: Q9PW66) whose orthologues have been conserved throughout evolution, from invertebrates to humans. 2 When injected intravenously or subcutaneously (from 0.06 to 500 pmol kg(-1)) or intrathecally (from 6 fmol to 250 pmol) in rats, Bv8 produced an intense systemic nociceptive sensitization to mechanical and thermal stimuli applied to the tail and paws. 3 Topically delivered into one rat paw, 50 fmol of Bv8 decreased by 50% the nociceptive threshold to pressure in the injected paw without affecting the threshold in the contralateral paw. 4 The two G-protein coupled prokineticin receptors, PK-R1 and PK-R2, were expressed in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and in dorsal quadrants of spinal cord (DSC) and bound Bv8 and the mammalian orthologue, EG-VEGF, with high affinity. In DSC, PK-R1 was more abundant than PK-R2, whereas both receptors were equally expressed in DRG. IC(50) of Bv8 and EG-VEGF to inhibit -Bv8 binding to rat DRG and DSC were 4.1+/-0.4 nM Bv8 and 76.4+/-7.6 nM EG-VEGF, in DRG; 7.3+/-0.9 nM Bv8 and 330+/-41 nM EG-VEGF, in DSC. 5 In the small diameter neurons (<30 microm) of rat DRG cultures, Bv8 concentrations, ranging from 0.2 to 10 nM, raised (i) in a dose-dependent manner. 6 These data suggest that Bv8, through binding to PK receptors of DSC and primary sensitive neurons, results in intense sensitization of peripheral nociceptors to thermal and mechanical stimuli.

12489194|t|The human tuftelin gene and the expression of tuftelin in mineralizing and nonmineralizing tissues.
12489194|a|Tuftelin has been suggested to play an important role during the development and mineralization of enamel, but its precise function is still unclear. This article reviews major milestones in the discovery, structural characterization, expression, localization, and conservation of tuftelin in different vertebrate species. It focuses on the structure of the human tuftelin gene, which has recently been deciphered . It describes the exon-intron organization, sizes and structure, the promoter structure, and the newly discovered alternatively spliced human tooth-bud tuftelin mRNA transcripts. It also examines information on the structural motifs in the human-derived tuftelin protein and how they relate to tuftelin from other species. It reviews our recent results on the transcription of tuftelin mRNA and protein expression in several nonmineralizing soft tissues, using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by DNA cloning and sequencing, indirect immunohistochemistry, immunohistochemistry combined with confocal microscopy, and in situ hybridization. These results and earlier Northern blot results show that tuftelin, in addition to being expressed in the developing and mineralizing tooth, is also expressed in several nonmineralizing soft tissues, suggesting that tuftelin has a universal function and/or a multifunctional role.

12504082|t|Human IL-21 and IL-4 bind to partially overlapping epitopes of common gamma-chain.
12504082|a|Interleukin 21 (IL-21) is a recently identified novel cytokine that plays an important role in the regulation of B, T, and NK cell functions. Its effects depend on binding to and signaling through an IL-21 receptor complex consisting of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and the common gamma-chain (gamma(c)). In this study using biosensor technique, the ligand-binding properties of IL-21R and gamma(c), which are presently poorly understood on a molecular level, were analyzed employing recombinant ectodomains of IL-21R and gamma(c). The formation of a binary complex between IL-21 and immobilized IL-21R (K(D) 70pM), gamma(c) and immobilized IL-21 (K(D) 160 microM) and a ternary complex between gamma(c) and IL-21 saturated immobilized IL-21R (K(D) 160nM) could be analyzed. The gamma(c) residues involved in IL-21 binding were defined by alanine-scanning mutational analysis. The epitope comprises gamma(c) residues N44, Y103, N128, L161, E162, and L208. It is not identical but partially overlapping with the previously established gamma(c) epitope for IL-4 binding. These results open the way to understand the molecular recognition mechanism in the IL-21 receptor system and also the promiscuous binding properties of gamma(c).

12504588|t|Robo1 and Robo2 are homophilic binding molecules that promote axonal growth.
12504588|a|In the present study we show that following transfection in 3T3 cells, human Robo1 and Robo2 stimulate neurite outgrowth from Robo-positive neurons (retinal neurons and olfactory neurons), but have no effect on Robo-negative neurons (cerebellar granule cells). The neurite outgrowth response was inhibited by an antibody raised against the first Ig domain of Robo1/2 or by soluble Robo-Fc chimera. Furthermore, we show that the extracellular domains of Robo1 and Robo2 are homophilic adhesion molecules that can also interact with each other. These data suggest a wider range of functions for the Robo family in the development of the nervous system and provide novel insights into the molecular basis for the phenotypes observed in Robo mutants in Drosophila, C. elegans, and zebrafish.

12721283|t|TIRP, a novel Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter protein involved in TIR signaling.
12721283|a|The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) family members play important roles in host defense. These receptors signal through TIR domain-containing adapter proteins. In this report, we identified a novel TIR domain-containing adapter protein designated as TIRP. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that TIRP is associated with IL-1 receptors. TIRP also interacts with kinase-inactive mutants of IRAK and IRAK-4, IRAK-2, IRAK-M, and TRAF6. Overexpression of TIRP activates NF-kappaB and potentiates IL-1 receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation. A dominant negative mutant of TIRP inhibits IL-1- but not tumor necrosis factor-triggered NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, TIRP-mediated NF-kappaB activation is inhibited by dominant negative mutants of IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and IKKbeta. Our findings suggest that TIRP is involved in IL-1-triggered NF-kappaB activation and functions upstream of IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and IKKbeta

12724311|t|Ca2+-dependent potentiation of the nonselective cation channel TRPV4 is mediated by a C-terminal calmodulin binding site.
12724311|a|Most Ca2+-permeable ion channels are inhibited by increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration (i), thus preventing potentially deleterious rises in i. In this study, we demonstrate that currents through the osmo-, heat- and phorbol ester-sensitive, Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel TRPV4 are potentiated by intracellular Ca2+. Spontaneous TRPV4 currents and currents stimulated by hypotonic solutions or phorbol esters were reduced strongly at all potentials in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The other permeant divalent cations Ba2+ and Sr2+ were less effective than Ca2+ in supporting channel activity. An intracellular site of Ca2+ action was supported by the parallel decrease in spontaneous currents and i on removal of extracellular Ca2+ and the ability of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores to restore TRPV4 activity in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. During TRPV4 activation by hypotonic solutions or phorbol esters, Ca2+ entry through the channel increased the rate and extent of channel activation. Currents were also potentiated by ionomycin in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Ca2+-dependent potentiation of TRPV4 was often followed by inhibition. By mutagenesis, we localized the structural determinant of Ca2+-dependent potentiation to an intracellular, C-terminal calmodulin binding domain. This domain binds calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. TRPV4 mutants that did not bind calmodulin lacked Ca2+-dependent potentiation. We conclude that TRPV4 activity is tightly controlled by intracellular Ca2+. Ca2+ entry increases both the rate and extent of channel activation by a calmodulin-dependent mechanism. Excessive increases in i via TRPV4 are prevented by a Ca2+-dependent negative feedback mechanism.

12728244|t|The AVIT protein family. Secreted cysteine-rich vertebrate proteins with diverse functions.
12728244|a|Homologues of a protein originally isolated from snake venom and frog skin secretions are present in many vertebrate species. They contain 80-90 amino acids, 10 of which are cysteines with identical spacing. Various names have been given to these proteins, such as mamba intestinal protein 1 (MIT1), Bv8 (Bombina variegata molecular mass approximately 8 kDa), prokineticins and endocrine-gland vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF). Their amino-terminal sequences are identical, and so we propose that the sequence of their first four residues, AVIT, is used as a name for this family. From a comparison of the sequences, two types of AVIT proteins can be discerned. These proteins seem to be distributed widely in mammalian tissues and are known to bind to G-protein-coupled receptors. Members of this family have been shown to stimulate contraction of the guinea pig ileum, to cause hyperalgesia after injection into rats and to be active as specific growth factors. Moreover, the messenger RNA level of one of these AVIT proteins changes rhythmically in the region of the brain known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This shows that members of this new family of small proteins are involved in diverse biological processes.

12761501|t|Large-scale identification and characterization of human genes that activate NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways.
12761501|a|We have carried out a large-scale identification and characterization of human genes that activate the NF-kappaB and MARK signaling pathways. We constructed full-length cDNA libraries using the oligo-capping method and prepared an arrayed cDNA pool consisting of 150 000 cDNAs randomly isolated from the libraries. For analysis of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, we introduced each of the cDNAs into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and examined whether it activated the transcription of a luciferase reporter gene driven by a promoter containing the consensus NF-kappaB binding sites. In total, we identified 299 cDNAs that activate the NF-kappaB pathway, and we classified them into 83 genes, including 30 characterized activator genes of the NF-kappaB pathway, 28 genes whose involvement in the NF-kappaB pathways have not been characterized and 25 novel genes. We then carried out a similar analysis for the identification of genes that activate the MARK pathway, utilizing the same cDNA resource. We assayed 145 000 cDNAs and identified 57 genes that activate the MARK pathway. Interestingly, 27 genes were overlapping between the NF-kappaB and the MAPK pathways, which may indicate that these genes play cross-talking roles between these two pathways.

12801932|t|Antagonistic effects of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzymes 1 and 2 on beta-amyloid peptide production in cells.
12801932|a|The deposition of extracellular beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) in the brain is a pathologic feature of Alzheimer's disease. The beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), an integral membrane aspartyl protease responsible for cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the beta-site, promotes A beta production. A second integral membrane aspartyl protease related to BACE1, referred to as beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2) has also been demonstrated to cleave APP at the beta-cleavage site in transfected cells. The role of endogenous BACE2 in A beta production remains unresolved. We investigated the role of endogenous BACE2 in A beta production in cells by selective inactivation of its transcripts using RNA interference. We are able to reduce steady state levels for mRNA for each enzyme by >85%, and protein amounts by 88-94% in cells. Selective inactivation of BACE1 by RNA interference results in decreased beta-cleaved secreted APP and A beta peptide secretion from cells, as expected. Selective inactivation of BACE2 by RNAi results in increased beta-cleaved secreted APP and A beta peptide secretion from cells. Simultaneous targeting of both enzymes by RNA interference does not have any net effect on A beta released from cells. Our observations of changes in APP metabolism and A beta are consistent with a role of BACE2 in suppressing A beta production in cells that co-express both enzymes.

12855678|t|Golgi localization of carbohydrate sulfotransferases is a determinant of L-selectin ligand biosynthesis.
12855678|a|Sulfation of endothelial glycoproteins by the sulfotransferase GlcNAc6ST-2 is a regulatory modification that promotes binding of the leukocyte adhesion molecule L-selectin. GlcNAc6ST-2 is a member of a family of related enzymes that act on similar carbohydrate substrates in vitro but discrete glycoproteins in vivo. We demonstrate that GlcNAc6ST-1, -2, and -3 have distinct Golgi distributions, with GlcNAc6ST-1 confined to the trans-Golgi network, GlcNAc6ST-3 confined to the early secretory pathway, and GlcNAc6ST-2 distributed throughout the Golgi. Their localization was correlated with preferred activity on either N-linked or O-linked glycoproteins. A chimera comprising the localization domain of GlcNAc6ST-1 fused to the catalytic domain of GlcNAc6ST-2 was confined to the trans-Golgi network and adopted the substrate preference of GlcNAc6ST-1. We propose a model in which Golgi enzyme localization and competition orchestrate the biosynthesis of L-selectin ligands.

12860405|t|Characterization of Pellino2, a substrate of IRAK1 and IRAK4.
12860405|a|Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are central components of Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) signaling pathways. In an attempt to discover novel signal transducers in TIR signaling, we identified human Pellino2 as an interaction partner of IRAK4. Pellino2 interacts with kinase-active as well as kinase-inactive IRAK1 and IRAK4. Furthermore, Pellino2 is one of the first substrates identified for IRAK1 and IRAK4. Functional studies using overexpression or RNAi knock-down of Pellino2 suggest a role of Pellino2 as a scaffolding protein similar to Pellino1. However, unlike Pellino1, Pellino2 does not seem to activate a specific transcription factor, but links TIR signaling to basic cellular processes.

12862317|t|Expression and localization of VCX/Y proteins and their possible involvement in regulation of ribosome assembly during spermatogenesis.
12862317|a|Variable Charge X/Y (VCX/Y) is a human testis-specific gene family that localized on X and Y chromosomes. In this study, VCY protein was expressed in E. coli in the form of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. With the purified fusion protein as antigen, the anti-GST-VCY antibody was generated and the localization of VCY protein in human testis was determined by immunohistochemistry. In the testis seminiferous epithelium, VCY proteins were highly expressed in nuclei of germ cells. Using propidium iodide staining and green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag technologies, VCY and VCX-8r proteins were mainly localized in the nucleoli of COS7 cells. In addition, the colocalization for VCY and VCX-8r in COS7 cells was also observed. With VCY cDNA as bait, a cDNA fragment of acidic ribosomal protein PO was obtained using yeast two-hybrid system. All the information above indicates that VCX/Y protein family might be involved in the regulation of ribosome assembly during spermatogenesis.

12878160|t|VIPL, a VIP36-like membrane protein with a putative function in the export of glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum.
12878160|a|Subsets of glycoproteins are thought to require lectin-like membrane receptors for efficient export out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To identify new members related to two previously characterized intracellular lectins ERGIC-53/p58 and VIP36, we carried out an extensive database search using the conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) as a search string. A gene, more closely related to VIP36 than to ERGIC-53/p58, and hence called VIPL (VIP36-Like), was identified. VIPL has been conserved through evolution from zebra fish to man. The 2.4-kb VIPL mRNA was widely expressed to varying levels in different tissues. Using an antiserum prepared against the CRD, the 32-kDa VIPL protein was detected in various cell lines. The single N-linked glycan of VIPL remained endoglycosidase H-sensitive during a 2-h pulse-chase, even when the protein was overexpressed or mutated to allow export to the plasma membrane. VIPL localized primarily to the ER and partly to the Golgi complex. Like VIP36, the cytoplasmic tail of VIPL terminates in the sequence KRFY, a motif characteristic for proteins recycling between the ER and ERGIC/cis-Golgi. Mutating the retrograde transport signal KR to AA resulted in transport of VIPL to the cell surface. Finally, knock-down of VIPL mRNA using siRNA significantly slowed down the secretion of two glycoproteins (M(R) 35 and 250 kDa) to the medium, suggesting that VIPL may also function as an ER export receptor.

12930836|t|Identification of a novel system L amino acid transporter structurally distinct from heterodimeric amino acid transporters.
12930836|a|A cDNA that encodes a novel Na+-independent neutral amino acid transporter was isolated from FLC4 human hepatocarcinoma cells by expression cloning. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the encoded protein designated LAT3 (L-type amino acid transporter 3) transported neutral amino acids such as l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-phenylalanine. The LAT3-mediated transport was Na+-independent and inhibited by 2-aminobicycloheptane-2-carboxylic acid, consistent with the properties of system L. Distinct from already known system L transporters LAT1 and LAT2, which form heterodimeric complex with 4F2 heavy chain, LAT3 was functional by itself in Xenopus oocytes. The deduced amino acid sequence of LAT3 was identical to the gene product of POV1 reported as a prostate cancer-up-regulated gene whose function was not determined, whereas it did not exhibit significant similarity to already identified transporters. The Eadie-Hofstee plots of LAT3-mediated transport were curvilinear, whereas the low affinity component is predominant at physiological plasma amino acid concentration. In addition to amino acid substrates, LAT3 recognized amino acid alcohols. The transport of l-leucine was electroneutral and mediated by a facilitated diffusion. In contrast, l-leucinol, l-valinol, and l-phenylalaninol, which have a net positive charge induced inward currents under voltage clamp, suggesting these compounds are transported by LAT3. LAT3-mediated transport was inhibited by the pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide, consistent with the property of system L2 originally characterized in hepatocyte primary culture. Based on the substrate selectivity, affinity, and N-ethylmaleimide sensitivity, LAT3 is proposed to be a transporter subserving system L2. LAT3 should denote a new family of organic solute transporters.

14525983|t|DACH1 inhibits transforming growth factor-beta signaling through binding Smad4.
14525983|a|The vertebrate homologues of Drosophila dachsund, DACH1 and DACH2, have been implicated as important regulatory genes in development. DACH1 plays a role in retinal and pituitary precursor cell proliferation and DACH2 plays a specific role in myogenesis. DACH proteins contain a domain (DS domain) that is conserved with the proto-oncogenes Ski and Sno. Since the Ski/Sno proto-oncogenes repress AP-1 and SMAD signaling, we hypothesized that DACH1 might play a similar cellular function. Herein, DACH1 was found to be expressed in breast cancer cell lines and to inhibit transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced apoptosis. DACH1 repressed TGF-beta induction of AP-1 and Smad signaling in gene reporter assays and repressed endogenous TGF-beta-responsive genes by microarray analyses. DACH1 bound to endogenous NCoR and Smad4 in cultured cells and DACH1 co-localized with NCoR in nuclear dotlike structures. NCoR enhanced DACH1 repression, and the repression of TGF-beta-induced AP-1 or Smad signaling by DACH1 required the DACH1 DS domain. The DS domain of DACH was sufficient for NCoR binding at a Smad4-binding site. Smad4 was required for DACH1 repression of Smad signaling. In Smad4 null HTB-134 cells, DACH1 inhibited the activation of SBE-4 reporter activity induced by Smad2 or Smad3 only in the presence of Smad4. DACH1 participates in the negative regulation of TGF-beta signaling by interacting with NCoR and Smad4.

14576168|t|A mammalian homolog of Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional coactivator intersex is a subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex.
14576168|a|The multiprotein Mediator complex is a coactivator required for transcriptional activation of RNA polymerase II transcribed genes by DNA binding transcription factors. We previously partially purified a Med8-containing Mediator complex from rat liver nuclei (Brower, C. S., Sato, S., Tomomori-Sato, C., Kamura, T., Pause, A., Stearman, R., Klausner, R. D., Malik, S., Lane, W. S., Sorokina, I., Roeder, R. G., Conaway, J. W., and Conaway, R. C. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 10353-10358). Analysis of proteins present in the most highly enriched Mediator fractions by tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of several new mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as several potential Mediator subunits. Here we identify one of these proteins, encoded by the previously uncharacterized AK000411 open reading frame, as a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. The AK000411 protein, which we designate hIntersex (human Intersex), shares significant sequence similarity with the Drosophila melanogaster intersex protein, which has functional properties expected of a transcriptional coactivator specific for the Drosophila doublesex transactivator. In addition, we show that hIntersex assembles into a subcomplex with Mediator subunits p28b and TRFP. Taken together, our findings identify a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator and shed new light on the architecture of the mammalian Mediator complex.

14595443|t|The netrin-G1 ligand NGL-1 promotes the outgrowth of thalamocortical axons.
14595443|a|Netrin-G1 is a lipid-anchored protein that is structurally related to the netrin family of axon guidance molecules. Netrin-G1 does not bind any of the known netrin receptors and its function is not known. Here we identify human netrin-G1 ligand (NGL-1), a transmembrane protein containing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) domains that specifically interacts with netrin-G1 through its LRR region. Whereas netrin-G1 is expressed highly in mouse thalamic axons, NGL-1 is most abundant in the striatum and the cerebral cortex--the intermediate and final targets, respectively, of thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Surface-bound NGL-1 stimulates, but soluble NGL-1 disrupts, the growth of embryonic thalamic axons, and in vitro data indicate that NGL-1 activity may be mediated at least partially by netrin-G1. Our findings provide evidence that netrin-G1 functions as an important component of the NGL-1 receptor to promote TCA outgrowth and that membrane-bound netrins can participate in receiving axonal signaling pathways.

14603251|t|TACC1-chTOG-Aurora A protein complex in breast cancer.
14603251|a|The three human TACC (transforming acidic coiled-coil) genes encode a family of proteins with poorly defined functions that are suspected to play a role in oncogenesis. A Xenopus TACC homolog called Maskin is involved in translational control, while Drosophila D-TACC interacts with the microtubule-associated protein MSPS (Mini SPindleS) to ensure proper dynamics of spindle pole microtubules during cell division. We have delineated here the interactions of TACC1 with four proteins, namely the microtubule-associated chTOG (colonic and hepatic tumor-overexpressed gene) protein (ortholog of Drosophila MSPS), the adaptor protein TRAP (tudor repeat associator with PCTAIRE2), the mitotic serine/threonine kinase Aurora A and the mRNA regulator LSM7 (Like-Sm protein 7). To measure the relevance of the TACC1-associated complex in human cancer we have examined the expression of the three TACC, chTOG and Aurora A in breast cancer using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. We show that expressions of TACC1, TACC2, TACC3 and Aurora A are significantly correlated and downregulated in a subset of breast tumors. Using siRNAs, we further show that depletion of chTOG and, to a lesser extent of TACC1, perturbates cell division. We propose that TACC proteins, which we also named 'Taxins', control mRNA translation and cell division in conjunction with microtubule organization and in association with chTOG and Aurora A, and that these complexes and cell processes may be affected during mammary gland oncogenesis.

14626429|t|Viruses as hijackers of PML nuclear bodies.
14626429|a|Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) are discrete interchromosomal macromolecular structures. The integrity of this dynamic nuclear subcompartment critically depends on the presence of the name-giving PML protein. Among the permanent or transient residents of PML-NBs are various regulatory proteins, including Sp100, CBP, pRb, HIPK2, RAD51 and p53. PML-NBs are frequently targeted by viral infections, as a number of different RNA and DNA viruses, including herpesviruses, adenoviruses, papovaviruses, papillomaviruses and arenaviruses, cause changes in PML-NBs. Viruses interfere with PML-NB in two ways: 1) some viral proteins can associate with PML-NB proteins and/or lead to the destruction and lysis of this subnuclear compartment, thus aiding viral gene expression and disabling the host's innate immunity; 2) the parental genomes of some nuclear-replicating DNA viruses associate preferentially with PML-NBs, which presumably serves to assist in viral gene expression or replication. Here we feature the different viral strategies leading to the hijacking of PML-NBs and discuss the consequences for the immune response.

14755250|t|An RNF11: Smurf2 complex mediates ubiquitination of the AMSH protein.
14755250|a|RING-finger proteins play crucial roles in ubiquitination events involved in diverse cellular processes including signal transduction, differentiation and apoptosis. Most of the RING-finger proteins have E3-ubiquitin ligase activity. RNF11 is a small RING-finger protein and harbors a RING-H2 domain and a PY motif that could facilitate protein:protein interaction(s) involved in oncogenesis. To isolate RNF11 protein partners and determine its role in normal and cancer cells, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening. Among 18 in-frame positive clones, three were found to be ZBRK1, Eps15 and AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM). ZBRK1 is a KRAB domain containing Zinc-finger protein and is known to repress target gene transcription in a BRCA1-dependent manner. Eps15 is monoubiquitinated and is part of an essential complex involved in the endocytosis of plasma membrane receptors via the clathrin-mediated internalization pathway. Recent studies have shown that AMSH protein is involved in BMP/TGF-beta signaling pathway by binding to Smad6 and Smad7. The association of RNF11 with these binding partners suggests that it would be involved in biological processes such as gene transcription, BMP/TGF-beta signaling and ubiquitination-associated events. Previously, we have shown that RNF11 interacts with the HECT-type E3 ligases AIP4 and Smurf2. Here, we show that RNF11 binds to AMSH in mammalian cells and that this interaction is independent of the RNF11 RING-finger domain and the PY motif. Our results also demonstrate that AMSH is ubiquitinated by Smurf2 E3 ligase in the presence of RNF11 and that a consequent reduction in its steady-state level requires both RNF11 and Smurf2. RNF11 therefore recruits AMSH to Smurf2 for ubiquitination, leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome. The potential functions of RNF11-mediated degradation of AMSH in breast cancer are discussed.

14990717|t|US11 of herpes simplex virus type 1 interacts with HIPK2 and antagonizes HIPK2-induced cell growth arrest.
14990717|a|Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a nuclear serine/threonine kinase of the subfamily of dual-specificity Yak1-related kinase proteins. HIPK2 was first described as a homeodomain-interacting protein kinase acting as a corepressor for homeodomain transcription factors. More recently, it was reported that HIPK2 plays a role in p53-mediated cellular apoptosis and could also participate in the regulation of the cell cycle. US11 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of several processes related to the survival of cells submitted to environmental stresses by mechanisms that are not fully elucidated. In an attempt to better understand the multiple functions of US11, we identified cellular binding partners of this protein by using the yeast two-hybrid system. We report that US11 interacts with HIPK2 through the PEST domain of HIPK2 and that this interaction occurs also in human cells. This interaction modifies the subcellular distribution of HIPK2 and protects the cell against the HIPK2-induced cell growth arrest.

15033475|t|Physical and functional interactions between Daxx and TSG101.
15033475|a|Daxx has been reported to mediate the Fas/JNK-dependent signals in the cytoplasm. However, several evidences have suggested that Daxx is located mainly in the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional regulator. Recently, we identified DMAP1, a TSG101-interacting protein as a Daxx binding partner by yeast two-hybrid screening. TSG101 has been shown to act as transcriptional co-repressor of nuclear hormone receptors. Here we examined whether TSG101also interacts with Daxx directly. The association of Daxx and TSG101 was confirmed using co-expressed tagged proteins. The interaction regions in both proteins were also mapped, and the cellular localization of the interaction was examined. TSG101 formed a complex with Daxx through its coiled-coil domain and co-localized in the nucleus. Furthermore, TSG101 enhanced Daxx-mediated repression of glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activity. These results provide the novel molecular interactions between Daxx and TSG101, which establish an efficient repressive transcription complex in the nucleus.

15064709|t|Aurora B -TACC1 protein complex in cytokinesis.
15064709|a|Taxins are a family of centrosomal proteins important for the regulation of mitosis and microtubule dynamics. Cytokinesis, the last step of M phase, is essential for chromosomal integrity and cell division. It is highly regulated and involves a reorganization of microtubules and actin filaments. We show here that TACC1 localizes diffusely to the midzone spindle in anaphase and strongly to the midbody during cytokinesis, indicating a possible involvement of this protein in the exit of M phase. TACC1 also relocalizes to the nucleolus in interphase. We demonstrate that TACC1 and the mitotic kinase Aurora B belong to the same complex during cytokinesis. We further show that Aurora B knocked down by RNA-mediated interference prevents the formation of the midbody - and consequently affects TACC1 localization at this site - and leads to abnormal cell division and multinucleated cells.

15096576|t|Mutual interactions between subunits of the human RNase MRP ribonucleoprotein complex.
15096576|a|The eukaryotic ribonuclease for mitochondrial RNA processing (RNase MRP) is mainly located in the nucleoli and belongs to the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) particles. RNase MRP is involved in the processing of pre-rRNA and the generation of RNA primers for mitochondrial DNA replication. A closely related snoRNP, which shares protein subunits with RNase MRP and contains a structurally related RNA subunit, is the pre-tRNA processing factor RNase P. Up to now, 10 protein subunits of these complexes have been described, designated hPop1, hPop4, hPop5, Rpp14, Rpp20, Rpp21, Rpp25, Rpp30, Rpp38 and Rpp40. To get more insight into the assembly of the human RNase MRP complex we studied protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions by means of GST pull-down experiments. A total of 19 direct protein-protein and six direct protein-RNA interactions were observed. The analysis of mutant RNase MRP RNAs showed that distinct regions are involved in the direct interaction with protein subunits. The results provide insight into the way the protein and RNA subunits assemble into a ribonucleoprotein particle. Based upon these data a new model for the architecture of the human RNase MRP complex was generated.

15122315|t|HIPK2 neutralizes MDM2 inhibition rescuing p53 transcriptional activity and apoptotic function.
15122315|a|The p53 oncosuppressor protein is subject to negative regulation by MDM2, which efficiently inhibits its activity through an autoregulatory loop. In response to stress, however, p53 undergoes post-translational modifications that allow the protein to escape MDM2 control, accumulate, and become active. Recent studies have shown that, following DNA damage, the HIPK2 serine/threonine kinase binds and phosphorylates p53, inducing p53 transcriptional activity and apoptotic function. Here, we investigated the role of HIPK2 in the activation of p53 in the presence of MDM2. We found that HIPK2 rescues p53 transcriptional activity overcoming MDM2 inhibition, and that restoration of this p53 function induces apoptosis. Recovery of p53-dependent apoptosis is achieved by preventing p53 nuclear export and ubiquitination mediated by MDM2 in vitro and in vivo following genotoxic stress. These results shed new light on the mechanisms by which the HIPK2/p53 pathway promotes apoptosis and suppression of tumorigenesis.

15130495|t|SLIT2-mediated ROBO2 signaling restricts kidney induction to a single site.
15130495|a|Kidney development occurs in a stereotypic position along the body axis. It begins when a single ureteric bud emerges from the nephric duct in response to GDNF secreted by the adjacent nephrogenic mesenchyme. Posterior restriction of Gdnf expression is considered critical for correct positioning of ureteric bud development. Here we show that mouse mutants lacking either SLIT2 or its receptor ROBO2, molecules known primarily for their function in axon guidance and cell migration, develop supernumerary ureteric buds that remain inappropriately connected to the nephric duct, and that the SLIT2/ROBO2 signal is transduced in the nephrogenic mesenchyme. Furthermore, we show that Gdnf expression is inappropriately maintained in anterior nephrogenic mesenchyme in these mutants. Thus our data identify an intercellular signaling system that restricts, directly or indirectly, the extent of the Gdnf expression domain, thereby precisely positioning the site of kidney induction.

15184369|t|Ca2+ dependence of the Ca2+-selective TRPV6 channel.
15184369|a|Microfluorimetry and patch-clamp experiments were performed on TRPV6-expressing HEK cells to determine whether this Ca(2+)-sensing Ca(2+) channel is constitutively active. Intact cells loaded with fura-2 had an elevated intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ((i)), which decreased to the same level such as in non-transfected cells if external Ca(2+) was chelated by EGTA. Whole cell recordings from non-transfected HEK cells and cells expressing human TRPV6 revealed the presence of a basal inward current in both types of cells when the internal solution contained 0.1 mm EGTA and 100 nm (i) or if the cytosolic Ca(2+) buffering remained undisturbed in perforated patch-clamp experiments. If recombinantly expressed TRPV6 forms open channels, one would expect Ca(2+)-induced current inhibition, because TRPV6 is negatively regulated by internal Ca(2+). However, dialyzing solutions with high  such as 1 microm into TRPV6-expressing cells did not block the basal inward current, which was not different from the recordings from non-transfected cells. In contrast, dialyzing 0.5 mm EGTA into TRPV6-expressing cells readily activated Ca(2+) inward currents, which were undetectable in non-transfected cells. Interestingly, monovalent cations permeated the TRPV6 channels under conditions where no Ca(2+) permeation was detectable, indicating that divalent cations block TRPV6 channels from the extracellular side. Like human TRPV6, the truncated human TRPV6(Delta695-725), which lacks the C-terminal domain required for Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding, does not form constitutive active channels, whereas the human TRPV6(D542A), carrying a point mutation in the presumed pore region, does not function as a channel. In summary, no constitutive open TRPV6 channels were detected in patch-clamp experiments from transfected HEK cells. However, channel activity is highly regulated by intracellular and extracellular divalent cations.

15231747|t|A protein interaction framework for human mRNA degradation.
15231747|a|The degradation of mRNA is an important regulatory step in the control of gene expression. However, mammalian RNA decay pathways remain poorly characterized. To provide a framework for studying mammalian RNA decay, a two-hybrid protein interaction map was generated using 54 constructs from 38 human proteins predicted to function in mRNA decay. The results provide evidence for interactions between many different proteins required for mRNA decay. Of particular interest are interactions between the poly(A) ribonuclease and the exosome and between the Lsm complex, decapping factors, and 5'-->3' exonucleases. Moreover, multiple interactions connect 5'-->3' and 3'-->5' decay proteins to each other and to nonsense-mediated decay factors, providing the opportunity for coordination between decay pathways. The interaction network also predicts the internal organization of the exosome and Lsm complexes. Additional interactions connect mRNA decay factors to many novel proteins and to proteins required for other steps in gene expression. These results provide an experimental insight into the organization of proteins required for mRNA decay and their coupling to other cellular processes, and the physiological relevance of many of these interactions are supported by their evolutionary conservation. The interactions also provide a wealth of hypotheses to guide future research on mRNA degradation and demonstrate the power of exhaustive protein interaction mapping in aiding understanding of uncharacterized protein complexes and pathways.

15232106|t|Self-assembling protein microarrays.
15232106|a|Protein microarrays provide a powerful tool for the study of protein function. However, they are not widely used, in part because of the challenges in producing proteins to spot on the arrays. We generated protein microarrays by printing complementary DNAs onto glass slides and then translating target proteins with mammalian reticulocyte lysate. Epitope tags fused to the proteins allowed them to be immobilized in situ. This obviated the need to purify proteins, avoided protein stability problems during storage, and captured sufficient protein for functional studies. We used the technology to map pairwise interactions among 29 human DNA replication initiation proteins, recapitulate the regulation of Cdt1 binding to select replication proteins, and map its geminin-binding domain.

15243141|t|Human p32, interacts with B subunit of the CCAAT-binding factor, CBF/NF-Y, and inhibits CBF-mediated transcription activation in vitro.
15243141|a|To understand the role of the CCAAT-binding factor, CBF, in transcription, we developed a strategy to purify the heterotrimeric CBF complex from HeLa cell extracts using two successive immunoaffinity chromatography steps. Here we show that the p32 protein, previously identified as the ASF/SF2 splicing factor-associated protein, copurified with the CBF complex. Studies of protein-protein interaction demonstrated that p32 interacts specifically with CBF-B subunit and also associates with CBF-DNA complex. Cellular localization by immunofluorescence staining revealed that p32 is present in the cell throughout the cytosol and nucleus, whereas CBF is present primarily in the nucleus. A portion of the p32 colocalizes with CBF-B in the nucleus. Interestingly, reconstitution of p32 in an in vitro transcription reaction demonstrated that p32 specifically inhibits CBF-mediated transcription activation. Altogether, our study identified p32 as a novel and specific corepressor of CBF-mediated transcription activation in vitro.

15280356|t|Induction of apoptosis by X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor via a caspase 8-dependent mechanism.
15280356|a|X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that is highly expressed during embryonic development and binds to ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). In this report, we demonstrate that although XEDAR lacks a death domain, it nevertheless induces apoptosis in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. The apoptosis-inducing ability of XEDAR is dependent on the activation of caspase 8 and can be blocked by its genetic and pharmacological inhibitors. Although XEDAR-induced apoptosis can be blocked by dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein and FADD small interfering RNA, XEDAR does not directly bind to FADD, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, or RIP1. Instead, XEDAR signaling leads to the formation of a secondary complex containing FADD, caspase 8, and caspase 10, which results in caspase activation. Thus, XEDAR belongs to a novel class of death receptors that lack a discernible death domain but are capable of activating apoptosis in a caspase 8- and FADD-dependent fashion. XEDAR may represent an early stage in the evolution of death receptors prior to the emergence of the death domain and may play a role in the induction of apoptosis during embryonic development and adult life.

15350218|t|WNK1 phosphorylates synaptotagmin 2 and modulates its membrane binding.
15350218|a|WNK (with no lysine ) protein kinases were named for their unique active site organization. Mutations in WNK1 and WNK4 cause a familial form of hypertension by undefined mechanisms. Here, we report that WNK1 selectively binds to and phosphorylates synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) within its calcium binding C2 domains. Endogenous WNK1 and Syt2 coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize on a subset of secretory granules in INS-1 cells. Phosphorylation by WNK1 increases the amount of Ca2+ required for Syt2 binding to phospholipid vesicles; mutation of threonine 202, a WNK1 phosphorylation site, partially prevents this change. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of Syts by WNK1 can regulate Ca2+ sensing and the subsequent Ca2+-dependent interactions mediated by Syt C2 domains. These findings provide a biochemical mechanism that could lead to the retention or insertion of proteins in the plasma membrane. Interruption of this regulatory pathway may disturb membrane events that regulate ion balance.   Copyright 2004 Cell Press

15383276|t|A protein interaction network links GIT1, an enhancer of huntingtin aggregation, to Huntington's disease.
15383276|a|Analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is a valuable approach for characterizing proteins of unknown function. Here, we have developed a strategy combining library and matrix yeast two-hybrid screens to generate a highly connected PPI network for Huntington's disease (HD). The network contains 186 PPIs among 35 bait and 51 prey proteins. It revealed 165 new potential interactions, 32 of which were confirmed by independent binding experiments. The network also permitted the functional annotation of 16 uncharacterized proteins and facilitated the discovery of GIT1, a G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein, which enhances huntingtin aggregation by recruitment of the protein into membranous vesicles. Coimmunoprecipitations and immunofluorescence studies revealed that GIT1 and huntingtin associate in mammalian cells under physiological conditions. Moreover, GIT1 localizes to neuronal inclusions, and is selectively cleaved in HD brains, indicating that its distribution and function is altered during disease pathogenesis.

1718282|t|Statherin: a major boundary lubricant of human saliva.
1718282|a|The lubricating properties of human submandibular-sublingual salivary fractions were examined using a servohydraulic model of mandibular movement. Fractions containing statherin exhibited a strong tendency to boundary lubrication. The lubricity of purified statherin was confirmed and compared to the amphipathic molecules gramacidin S and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Contact angle measurements of statherin paralleled the other amphipathic molecules. The helical content of statherin increased in trifluoroethanol indicating the presence of amphipathic helical regions. CD studies and hydrophobic moment calculations indicated that statherin adopts an amphipathic helical conformation at the N-terminus. An energy-minimized model of the polar N-terminal residues 1-15 suggested that this domain could be positioned in space to interact with a hydroxyapatite substrate. These data imply that under appropriate conditions statherin may display an amphipathic nature which enables it to function as a boundary lubricant on enamel.

1833184|t|A novel IL-1 receptor, cloned from B cells by mammalian expression, is expressed in many cell types.
1833184|a|cDNA clones corresponding to an Mr approximately 80,000 receptor (type I receptor) for interleukin-1 (IL-1) have been isolated previously by mammalian expression. Here, we report the use of an improved expression cloning method to isolate human and murine cDNA clones encoding a second type (Mr approximately 60,000) of IL-1 receptor (type II receptor). The mature type II IL-1 receptor consists of (i) a ligand binding portion comprised of three immunoglobulin-like domains; (ii) a single transmembrane region; and (iii) a short cytoplasmic domain of 29 amino acids. This last contrasts with the approximately 215 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the type I receptor, and suggests that the two IL-1 receptors may interact with different signal transduction pathways. The type II receptor is expressed in a number of different tissues, including both B and T lymphocytes, and can be induced in several cell types by treatment with phorbol ester. Both IL-1 receptors appear to be well conserved in evolution, and map to the same chromosomal location. Like the type I receptor, the human type II IL-1 receptor can bind all three forms of IL-1 (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-1ra). Vaccinia virus contains an open reading frame bearing strong resemblance to the type II IL-1 receptor.

8081366|t|Characterization of a novel gene in the human major histocompatibility complex that encodes a potential new member of the I kappa B family of proteins.
8081366|a|At least 110 genes are now known to be located in the 4000 kb of DNA encompassing the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the chromosome band 6p21.3. Recent genomic sequence analysis of a 90 kb segment of DNA containing the tumour necrosis factor genes in the class III region of the MHC has predicted the presence of three potential exons mapping between the BAT1 and TNFB genes (12). A near full-length cDNA clone corresponding to a novel gene located between BAT1 and TNFB that contains sequence corresponding to one of these putative exons, has been isolated from a premonocytic leukaemic cell line cDNA library. Characterization of this gene reveals that it spans 13.5 kb of DNA, with the 3' end of the gene lying approximately 12 kb from the 5' end of the TNFB gene. The cDNA hybridizes to a approximately 1.6 kb mRNA in a number of different cell types, including monocytes, T cells, B cells and hepatocytes. The putative polypeptide encoded by this cDNA is 381 amino acids in length, with a non-glycosylated M(r) of 43214. It contains one partial and two full ANK repeats, which bear a marked similarity to those in the I kappa B family of proteins, suggesting that the protein encoded by the novel gene could represent a divergent member of this family.

8332913|t|Interleukin-1 type II receptor: a decoy target for IL-1 that is regulated by IL-4.
8332913|a|Interleukin-1 (IL-1) interacts with cells through two types of binding molecules, IL-1 type I receptor (IL-1R I) and IL-1R II. The function of IL-1R II is unknown. In studies using monoclonal antibodies, IL-1 prolonged the in vitro survival of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) through IL-1R I, and IL-4 antagonized the action of IL-1 by inducing expression and release of IL-1R II. Dexamethasone also induced expression and release of the IL-1R II in PMN. These results, together with the effect of antibodies to IL-1R on IL-1-induced production of cytokines in monocytes, indicate that IL-1 acts on myelomonocytic cells through IL-1R I and that IL-1R II inhibits IL-1 activity by acting as a decoy target for IL-1. The existence of multiple pathways of regulation emphasizes the need for tight control of IL-1 action.

8333863|t|cDNA cloning and expression of two new members of the human liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B subfamily.
8333863|a|Two new UDP-glucuronosyltransferase cDNAs, designated UGT2B10 and UGT2B11, encoding 528 amino acid proteins were isolated from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequences of UGTs 2B10 and 2B11 share > 76% sequence similarity with other known human liver UGT2B subfamily isoforms and < 48% sequence similarity with UGT1 family proteins. COS-7 cells transfected with UGT 2B10 and 2B11 synthesized proteins with respective molecular masses of 49kDa and 51kDa. UGT2B11 expressed in COS-7 cells glucuronidated a number of polyhydroxylated estrogens (estriol, 4-hydroxyestrone and 2-hydroxyestriol) and xenobiotics (4-methylumbelliferone, 1-naphthol, 4-nitrophenol, 2-aminophenol, 4-hydroxybiphenyl and menthol). Despite the screening of more than forty potential substrates, glucuronidation activity was not observed for expressed UGT2B10.

8537117|t|Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones for Humly9: the human homologue of mouse Ly9.
8537117|a|Ly9 is a mouse cell membrane antigen found on all lymphocytes and coded for by a gene that maps to chromosome 1. We previously described the isolation and characterization of a full-length cDNA clone for mouse Ly9. Using cross-species hybridization we isolated cDNA clones encoding the human homologue Humly9. Analysis of the predicted protein sequence suggests that the extra-cellular portion of the Humly9 molecules is composed of four Ig-like domains: a V domain (V) without disulphide bonds and a truncated C2 domain (tC2) with two disulphide bonds, a second V domain without disulphide bonds and a second tC2 with two disulphide bonds, i.e., as V-tC2-V-tC2. The gene encoding Humly9 was mapped to chromosome 1 by analysis of human/hamster hybrids, and more specifically to the 1q22 region by in situ hybridization. The protein sequence data support the view that Humly9 belongs to the immunoglobulin-superfamily subgroup which includes CD48, CD2, and LFA-3.

8606489|t|SM-20 is a novel 40-kd protein whose expression in the arterial wall is restricted to smooth muscle.
8606489|a|We have previously reported the identification of a novel cDNA, SM-20, whose corresponding mRNA levels are regulated by growth factors in rat aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) culture. Affinity-purified polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were made against a 230 amino acid region of the SM-20 putative peptide expressed in the bacterial vector, pET-3b. Western blot analyses of rat and human SMC lysates detected a single protein species of approximately 40 kd. SM-20 was not detected in concentrates of the culture medium. By immunohistochemistry, SM-20 was localized to filaments in the cytoplasm of cultured SMC. Like SM-20 mRNA, levels of SM-20 protein were increased 1-3 hours after serum stimulation of rat aortic SMC. In rat tissues, SM-20 antigen was detected in abundance in smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscle. SM-20 was also detected in some epithelial cells of the kidney, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, but was not found in the parenchyma of the liver, spleen, or testis. In the rat arterial wall, SM-20 antigen was restricted to the SMC of the media and, after balloon arterial injury, was found most abundantly in the neointima. In human atherosclerotic coronary arteries, SM-20 antigen predominated in the SMC of the intimal plaques and was not detected in macrophages, endothelium, or adventitial cells. Thus, SM-20 encodes a protein which serves as a novel SMC-specific marker within the vessel wall.

8702627|t|Prk, a cytokine-inducible human protein serine/threonine kinase whose expression appears to be down-regulated in lung carcinomas.
8702627|a|We have cloned and characterized a putative protein serine/threonine kinase termed prk through a combination of polymerase chain reaction and conventional cDNA library screening approaches. There are apparently two distinct domains within prk protein deduced from its nucleotide sequences. The amino-terminal portion has the feature of the catalytic domain of a serine/threonine kinase and shows strong homology to mouse fnk and other polo family kinases including mouse snk, human and murine plk, Drosophila polo, and yeast Cdc5. The carboxyl-terminal portion, presumably the regulatory domain, shares extensive homology to mouse fnk. Northern blotting analyses reveal that prk expression is restricted to a very limited number of tissues with placenta, ovaries, and lung containing detectable amounts of prk mRNA. prk mRNA expression is also detected at a low level in the megakaryocytic cell line Dami, MO7e, and three brain glioma cell lines. In addition, refeeding of serum-deprived MO7e, Dami, and K562 cells of hematopoietic origin and GMOO637D of lung fibroblasts rapidly activates prk mRNA expression with its peak induction around 2 h after serum addition. prk gene activation by the serum requires no new protein synthesis. The recombinant cytokines such as interleukin-3 and thrombopoietin also activate prk mRNA expression in MO7e cells. Furthermore, a survey of RNAs isolated from the tumor and the uninvolved tissues from 18 lung cancer patients reveals that prk mRNA expression is significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues. Southern blotting analysis indicates that the prk gene is present in a single copy in the genome of tumors and normal cells. Taken together, these results suggest that prk expression may be restricted to proliferating cells and involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression. The molecular cloning of prk cDNA will facilitate the study of its biological role as well as its potential role in tumorigenesis.

8706133|t|Pathway leading to correctly folded beta-tubulin.
8706133|a|We describe the complete beta-tubulin folding pathway. Folding intermediates produced via ATP-dependent interaction with cytosolic chaperonin undergo a sequence of interactions with four proteins (cofactors A, D, E, and C). The postchaperonin steps in the reaction cascade do not depend on ATP or GTP hydrolysis, although GTP plays a structural role in tubulin folding. Cofactors A and D function by capturing and stabilizing beta-tubulin in a quasi-native conformation. Cofactor E binds to the cofactor D-beta-tubulin complex; interaction with cofactor C then causes the release of beta-tubulin polypeptides that are committed to the native state. Sequence analysis identifies yeast homologs of cofactors D (cin1) and E (pac2), characterized by mutations that affect microtubule function.

8938450|t|Assignment of the PSST subunit gene of human mitochondrial complex I to chromosome 19p13.
8938450|a|The cDNA for the PSST subunit of human mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH): ubiquinone oxidoreductase  was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of human cDNA. The sequence of the mature protein deduced from the cDNA codes for a protein that is closely related to the bovine protein (93% homology). Nine conservative substitutions are found in the mature protein, mainly in the N and C terminal regions. The mature human protein is missing four amino acids (PAAL) close to the N terminus that are present in the bovine protein. The N terminus of the mature protein is preceded by a presequence of 38 amino acids that, although quite different from its bovine counterpart (52% homology), has properties that are characteristic of a mitochondrial import sequence. Southern hybridization analysis predicts an estimated gene size of 3.8 kb. Northern hybridization analysis of mRNA from fibroblasts of complex I-deficient patients revealed no size or transcript level abnormalities. The cDNA of the PSST protein was used to investigate tissue-specific expression and to localize the gene for this subunit to chromosome 19p13.

9047234|t|cDNA cloning and primary structure analysis of C1qR(P), the human C1q/MBL/SPA receptor that mediates enhanced phagocytosis in vitro.
9047234|a|The complement protein C1q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and pulmonary surfactant protein A (SPA) are structurally similar molecules that enhance phagocytic function in vitro. Monoclonal antibodies R3 and R139, which inhibit the enhancement triggered by these three ligands, were used to purify a 126,000 M(r) cell surface protein designated C1qR(P). Amino acid sequence was obtained and the corresponding cDNA was cloned. C1qR(P) is a novel type I membrane protein with the following putative structural elements: a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain, five EGF-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. All peptides identified by amino acid sequencing are encoded by the cDNA. Additionally, an anti-peptide antiserum was generated, which is reactive with C1qR(P). The data indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes the receptor that plays a role in C1q/MBL/SPA-mediated removal or destruction of pathogens and immune complexes by phagocytosis.

9129147|t|JEM-1, a novel gene encoding a leucine-zipper nuclear factor upregulated during retinoid-induced maturation of NB4 promyelocytic leukaemia.
9129147|a|Retinoid-induced proliferation causing hyperleukocytosis is a severe complication of retinoid therapy in t(15;17) acute promyelocytic leukaemia. The molecular basis of this phenomenon is unknown. It is possible that the transiently enhanced cell proliferation results from RA-induction of growth regulatory genes. Using Differential Display of cDNAs from NB4 cells we have identified Jem, a novel gene transcript which is upregulated by retinoids during the early proliferative response in maturating cells but not in resistant cells. A 2.7 kb cDNA was cloned and sequenced. The open reading frame contains a 400 amino acid sequence corresponding to a novel 45 kDa basic protein (pI 8.9). The JEM DNA sequence is detected by FISH on human chromosome 1 at q24. The Jem peptide sequence shows a 'leucine-zipper' dimerisation motif with limited homology to Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB proteins and several putative phosphorylation sites. An atypical basic region may correspond to an unknown DNA-binding domain. The C-terminal end of Jem spans a long stretch featuring a PEST motif. After transfection into COS cells, the Jem protein shows a ponctuated nuclear localisation. We hypothesise that this novel nuclear factor may act as a transcription factor, or a coregulator, involved in either cell growth control and/or maturation.

9149941|t|A 1.1-Mb transcript map of the hereditary hemochromatosis locus.
9149941|a|In the process of positionally cloning a candidate gene responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), we constructed a 1.1-Mb transcript map of the region of human chromosome 6p that lies 4.5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A. A combination of three gene-finding techniques, direct cDNA selection, exon trapping, and sample sequencing, were used initially for a saturation screening of the 1.1-Mb region for expressed sequence fragments. As genetic analysis further narrowed the HH candidate locus, we sequenced completely 0.25 Mb of genomic DNA as a final measure to identify all genes. Besides the novel MHC class 1-like HH candidate gene HLA-H, we identified a family of five butyrophilin-related sequences, two genes with structural similarity to a type 1 sodium phosphate transporter, 12 novel histone genes, and a gene we named RoRet based on its strong similarity to the 52-kD Ro/SSA lupus and Sjogren's syndrome auto-antigen and the RET finger protein. Several members of the butyrophilin family and the RoRet gene share an exon of common evolutionary origin called B30-2. The B30-2 exon was originally isolated from the HLA class 1 region, yet has apparently "shuffled" into several genes along the chromosome telomeric to the MHC. The conservation of the B30-2 exon in several novel genes and the previously described amino acid homology of HLA-H to MHC class 1 molecules provide further support that this gene-rich region of 6p21.3 is related to the MHC. Finally, we performed an analysis of the four approaches for gene finding and conclude that direct selection provides the most effective probes for cDNA screening, and that as much as 30% of ESTs in this 1.1-Mb region may be derived from noncoding genomic DNA.

9171375|t|Three human RNA polymerase III-specific subunits form a subcomplex with a selective function in specific transcription initiation.
9171375|a|Transcription by RNA polymerase III involves recruitment of the polymerase by template-bound accessory factors, followed by initiation, elongation, and termination steps. An immunopurification approach has been used to demonstrate that human RNA Pol III is composed of 16 subunits, some of which are apparently modified in HeLa cells. Partial denaturing conditions and sucrose gradient sedimentation at high salt result in the dissociation of a subcomplex that includes hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62. Cognate cDNAs were isolated and shown to encode three subunits that are specific to RNA Pol III and homologous to three yeast subunits. The human RNA Pol III core lacking the subcomplex functions in transcription elongation and termination following nonspecific initiation on a tailed template, but fails to show promoter-dependent transcription initiation in conjunction with accessory factors. The capability for specific transcription initiation can be restored either by the natural subcomplex or by a stable subcomplex composed of recombinant hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62 polypeptides. One component (hRPC39) of this subcomplex interacts physically with both hTBP and hTFIIIB90, two subunits of human RNA Pol III transcription initiation factor IIIB. These data strongly suggest that the hRPC32-hRPC39-hRPC62 subcomplex directs RNA Pol III binding to the TFIIIB-DNA complex via the interactions between TFIIIB and hRPC39.

9223106|t|Presenilin 1 interaction in the brain with a novel member of the Armadillo family.
9223106|a|One approach to understanding the function of presenilin 1 (PS1), is to discover those proteins with which it interacts. Evidence for a function in developmental patterning came from C. elegans, in which a PS homologue was identified by screening for suppressors of a mutation in Notch/lin-12, a gene which specifies cell fate. However, this genetic experiment cannot determine which proteins directly interact with PS1. Therefore, we utilized the two hybrid system and confirmatory co-immunoprecipitations to identify a novel catenin, termed delta-catenin, which interacts with PS1 and is principally expressed in brain. The catenins are a gene family related to the Armadillo gene in Drosophila, some of which appear to have dual roles-they are components of cell-cell adherens junctions, and may serve as intermediates in the Wingless (Wg) signaling pathway, which, like Notch/lin-12, is also responsible for a variety of inductive signaling events. In the non-neuronal 293 cell line, PS1 interacted with beta-catenin, the family member with the greatest homology to Armadillo. Wg and Notch interactions are mediated by the Dishevelled gene, which may form a signaling complex with PS1 and Wg pathway intermediates to regulate the function of the Notch/lin-12 gene.

9234719|t|A transcriptional mediator protein that is required for activation of many RNA polymerase II promoters and is conserved from yeast to humans.
9234719|a|A temperature-sensitive mutation was obtained in Med6p, a component of the mediator complex from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mediator complex has been shown to enable transcriptional activation in vitro. This mutation in Med6p abolished activation of transcription from four of five inducible promoters tested in vivo. There was no effect, however, on uninduced transcription, transcription of constitutively expressed genes, or transcription by RNA polymerases I and III. Mediator-RNA polymerase II complex isolated from the mutant yeast strain was temperature sensitive for transcriptional activation in a reconstituted in vitro system due to a defect in initiation complex formation. A database search revealed the existence of MED6-related genes in humans and Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that the role of mediator in transcriptional activation is conserved throughout the evolution.

9315665|t|Isolation and functional analysis of a cDNA for human Jagged2, a gene encoding a ligand for the Notch1 receptor.
9315665|a|Signaling through Notch receptors has been implicated in the control of cellular differentiation in animals ranging from nematodes to humans. Starting from a human expressed sequence tag-containing sequence resembling that of Serrate, the gene for a ligand of Drosophila melanogaster Notch, we assembled a full-length cDNA, now called human Jagged2, from overlapping cDNA clones. The full-length cDNA encodes a polypeptide having extensive sequence homology to Serrate (40.6% identity and 58.7% similarity) and even greater homology to several putative mammalian Notch ligands that have subsequently been described. When in situ hybridization was performed, expression of the murine Jagged2 homolog was found to be highest in fetal thymus, epidermis, foregut, dorsal root ganglia, and inner ear. In Northern blot analysis of RNA from tissues of 2-week-old mice, the 5.0-kb Jagged2 transcript was most abundant in heart, lung, thymus, skeletal muscle, brain, and testis. Immunohistochemistry revealed coexpression of Jagged2 and Notch1 within thymus and other fetal murine tissues, consistent with interaction of the two proteins in vivo. Coculture of fibroblasts expressing human Jagged2 with murine C2C12 myoblasts inhibited myogenic differentiation, accompanied by increased Notch1 and the appearance of a novel 115-kDa Notch1 fragment. Exposure of C2C12 cells to Jagged2 led to increased amounts of Notch mRNA as well as mRNAs for a second Notch receptor, Notch3, and a second Notch ligand, Jagged1. Constitutively active forms of Notchl in C2C12 cells also induced increased levels of the same set of mRNAs, suggesting positive feedback control of these genes initiated by binding of Jagged2 to Notch1. This feedback control may function in vivo to coordinate differentiation across certain groups of progenitor cells adopting identical cell fates.

9368056|t|Isolation and characterization of a novel ligand-dependent thyroid hormone receptor-coactivating protein.
9368056|a|The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) regulates the expression of target genes upon binding to triiodothyronine (T3) response elements. In the presence of T3, the TR recruits coactivating proteins that both modulate and integrate the ligand response. We report here the cloning of a novel protein using the TR ligand-binding domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Analysis of a putative full-length clone demonstrates a cDNA sequence that encodes a protein of 920 amino acids with a size of 120 kDa (p120). Alignment with known sequences shows homology to a previously identified protein of unknown function, termed skeletal muscle abundant protein. Interaction studies demonstrate that p120 interacts with the TR AF-2 domain in the presence of ligand through a 111-amino acid region. Northern analysis demonstrates widespread expression in human tissues. Cotransfection assays in CV-1 cells demonstrate that p120 enhances TR-mediated transactivation on multiple T3 response elements in the presence of T3. In addition, CREB-binding protein synergizes with p120 to enhance this effect. When linked to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, p120 is an activator of transcription alone. Thus, p120 satisfies a number of important criteria as a nuclear receptor coactivator.

9381176|t|Functional coherence of the human Y chromosome.
9381176|a|A systematic search of the nonrecombining region of the human Y chromosome (NRY) identified 12 novel genes or families, 10 with full-length complementary DNA sequences. All 12 genes, and six of eight NRY genes or families previously isolated by less systematic means, fell into two classes. Genes in the first group were expressed in many organs; these housekeeping genes have X homologs that escape X inactivation. The second group, consisting of Y-chromosomal gene families expressed specifically in testes, may account for infertility among men with Y deletions. The coherence of the NRY's gene content contrasts with the apparently haphazard content of most eukaryotic chromosomes.

9426230|t|Cloning and characterization of a novel human pH-dependent organic cation transporter, OCTN1.
9426230|a|cDNA for a novel proton/organic cation transporter, OCTN1, was cloned from human fetal liver and its transport activity was investigated. OCTN1 encodes a 551-amino acid protein with 11 transmembrane domains and one nucleotide binding site motif. It is strongly expressed in kidney, trachea, bone marrow and fetal liver and in several human cancer cell lines, but not in adult liver. When expressed in HEK293 cells, OCTN1 exhibited saturable and pH-dependent tetraethyl ammonium uptake with higher activity at neutral and alkaline pH than at acidic pH. Furthermore, treatment with metabolic inhibitors reduced the uptake, which is consistent with the presence of the nucleotide binding site sequence motif. Although its subcellular localization and detailed functional characteristics are not clear at present, OCTN1 appears to be a novel proton antiporter that functions for active secretion of cationic compounds across the renal epithelial brush-border membrane. It may play a role in the renal excretion of xenobiotics and their metabolites.

9451016|t|Cloning and functional expression of the human GlcNAc-1-P transferase, the enzyme for the committed step of the dolichol cycle, by heterologous complementation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
9451016|a|The gene for the human dolichol cycle GlcNAc-1-P transferase (ALG7/GPT) was cloned by screening a human lung fibroblast cDNA library. The library was constructed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector, and the positive clone was identified by complementation of the conditional lethal S.cerevisiae strain YPH-A7-GAL. This strain was constructed by replacing the endogenous promoter of the GPT-gene by the stringently regulated GAL1-promoter. This construct allows to specifically suppress the endogenous enzyme activity. The insert of the positive clone displayed an open reading frame of 1200 nucleotides, coding for a putative protein of 400 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 44.7 kDa. The deduced protein sequence shows a homology of over 90% when compared with other mammalian GPT sequences, thus resembling the close phylogenetic relationship between mammalian species. This homology however decreases to 40-50% when compared to more distantly related organisms such as S.cerevisiae , Schizosaccharomyces pombe , or Leishmania amazonensis . Biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein showed that it is functionally expressed in the S.cerevisiae strain YPH-A7-GAL. GlcNAc- and GlcNAc2-PP-Dolichol biosynthesis could be shown with isolated S.cerevisiae membranes from cells harboring the recombinant plasmid and grown on glucose thus suppressing transcription of the endogenous gene. Synthesis could be stimulated by dolicholphosphate and was inhibited by tunicamycin. These results show that we have cloned the human GlcNAc-1-P transferase by heterologous complementation in S. cerevisiae, a strategy that may be useful for the cloning and characterization of glycosyltransferases from a variety of organisms.

9462743|t|Mutations in PROP1 cause familial combined pituitary hormone deficiency.
9462743|a|Combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) in man denotes impaired production of growth hormone (GH) and one or more of the other five anterior pituitary hormones. Mutations of the pituitary transcription factor gene POU1F1 (the human homologue of mouse Pit1) are responsible for deficiencies of GH, prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in Snell and Jackson dwarf mice and in man, while the production of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is preserved. The Ames dwarf (df) mouse displays a similar phenotype, and appears to be epistatic to Snell and Jackson dwarfism. We have recently positionally cloned the putative Ames dwarf gene Prop1, which encodes a paired-like homeodomain protein that is expressed specifically in embryonic pituitary and is necessary for Pit1 expression. In this report, we have identified four CPHD families with homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for inactivating mutations of PROP1. These mutations in the human PROP1 gene result in a gene product with reduced DNA-binding and transcriptional activation ability in comparison to the product of the murine df mutation. In contrast to individuals with POU1F1 mutations, those with PROP1 mutations cannot produce LH and FSH at a sufficient level and do not enter puberty spontaneously. Our results identify a major cause of CPHD in humans and suggest a direct or indirect role for PROP1 in the ontogenesis of pituitary gonadotropes, as well as somatotropes, lactotropes and caudomedial thyrotropes.

9468509|t|Molecular cloning of a T cell-specific adapter protein (TSAd) containing an Src homology (SH) 2 domain and putative SH3 and phosphotyrosine binding sites.
9468509|a|Adapter proteins link catalytic signaling proteins to cell surface receptors or downstream effector proteins. In this paper, we present the cDNA sequence F2771, isolated from an activated CD8+ T cell cDNA library. The F2771 cDNA encodes a novel putative adapter protein. The predicted amino acid sequence includes an SH2 domain as well as putative SH3 and phosphotyrosine binding interaction motifs, but lacks any known catalytic domains. The expression of the gene is limited to tissues of the immune system and, in particular, activated T cells. The protein expressed by F2771 cDNA in transfected COS cells is localized in the cytoplasm. A polyclonal antiserum raised against an F2771-encoded peptide reacts with a tyrosine-phosphorylated 52-kDa protein expressed in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The gene is localized to chromosome 1q21, a region often found to be aberrant in lymphomas. The T cell-specific expression and the rapid induction of mRNA expression upon receptor binding, as well as the lack of catalytic domains in the presence of protein interaction domains, indicate that the F2771 gene encodes a novel T cell-specific adapter protein (TSAd) involved in the control of T cell activation.

9473517|t|Characterisation of a new human and murine member of the DnaJ family of proteins.
9473517|a|We report the characterisation of a human gene, designated MCG18 (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 candidate gene 18), that encodes a new member of the DnaJ family of proteins. Database searches indicate that MCG18 also has the locus name HSPF2. MCG18 lies 250bp centromeric of the VRF/VEGFB gene on chromosome 11q13. The MCG18 cDNA is predicted to encode a 241 amino acid product that has partial homology to Escherichia coli dnaJ in that it contains the J domain. However, MCG18 has greatest similarity to a functionally undefined protein from Caenorhabditis elegans, both of which are predicted to have a membrane-spanning region adjacent to their J domains. The cDNA encoding the murine homolog (Mcg18) was also cloned and sequenced, and the encoded protein shares 81% similarity to MCG18. The coding region of MCG18 is interrupted by 4 introns and the mRNA is expressed as a 1.4kb message in all tissues examined, including those derived from the breast, ovary, bladder, lung and keratinocytes.

9479505|t|Discovery of three novel G-protein-coupled receptor genes.
9479505|a|We report here the molecular cloning, tissue distribution, and chromosomal localization of novel genes encoding G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A search of a mouse database of expressed sequence tags revealed an EST partially encoding a GPCR, which was used to screen a mouse genomic library to obtain the translational open reading frame (ORF). The resultant clone, GPR27, contained an intronless ORF, encoding a receptor of 379 amino acids. In an alternate strategy, human genomic DNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, using degenerate oligonucleotides based on GPR1. Two PCR products partially encoding GPCRs were isolated and used to screen a genomic library to obtain the translational ORF. One of the resultant clones, GPR30, contained an intronless ORF encoding a receptor of 375 amino acids. The other clone, GPR35, also contained an intronless ORF encoding a receptor of 309 amino acids. Transcripts corresponding to GPR27 and GPR30 were detected in several areas of human and rat CNS, While GPR35 expression was detected only in the rat intestine. Through fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis the gene encoding GPR30 was localized to chromosome 7p22 and GPR35 to chromosome 2q37.3.

9480752|t|Identification of a novel Ran binding protein 2 related gene (RANBP2L1) and detection of a gene cluster on human chromosome 2q11-q12.
9480752|a|The giant 358-kDa protein Ran binding protein 2 (RanBP2/Nup358) is localized at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex and likely constitutes the Ran-GTP binding site at the cytoplasmic face of the complex. RanBP2/Nup358 furthermore acts as a chaperone for red/green opsin molecules. Here, we report on the physical mapping of human RanBP2 between markers D2S340 and D2S1893. A duplication of the 5'-end sequence of RanBP2 occurs within 3 Mb distal to RanBP2. Detailed sequence analysis resulted in primers specific for this distal duplication. Polymerase chain reaction-based screening of cDNA libraries indicates that this transcript, called RanBP2alpha (HGMW-approved symbol RANBP2L1), is expressed in several tissues. Screening of a fetal brain cDNA library yielded a 4057-bp partial cDNA clone for RanBP2alpha. Its 5'-end is almost identical to RanBP2, whereas its 3'-part is distinct from RanBP2. Northern blot analysis using a probe of the 3'-untranslated sequence of RanBP2alpha detected in several tissues an 8-kb transcript representing the full length of the transcript. In pancreas and placenta, an additional transcript of 14 kb was detected. PAC clones containing the bona fide RanBP2 sequences were localized to 2q11-q12 by FISH analysis, and a region of high similarity was detected on 2p11-p12. In summary, we have identified a RanBP2 gene cluster on 2q11-q12 together with a novel gene termed RanBP2alpha, with high sequence similarity to RanBP2.   Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

9482110|t|The C-terminus of the HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein mediates interaction with the PDZ domain of cellular proteins.
9482110|a|Infection by HTLV-1 has been correlated with the appearance of various proliferative or degenerative diseases. Some of these disorders have been observed in transgenic mice expressing the Tax protein, which is known to transactivate various viral and cellular promoters through interactions with several transcription factors. In this study we show that the C-terminus of this viral oncoprotein represents a motif permitting binding of Tax to the PDZ domains of several cellular proteins. A two-hybrid screen with Tax as bait indeed yielded complementary DNAs coding for six proteins including PDZ domains. Two of them correspond to truncated forms of the PSD-95 and beta1-syntrophin proteins, another clone codes for a protein homologous to the product of the C. elegans gene lin-7. The other three clones code for new human members of the PDZ family of cellular proteins. The interaction of Tax with the products of these clones was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells, and analysis of various mutants of Tax established the importance of the C-terminal amino acids for several of these interactions. These data suggest that Tax could perturb the normal function of targeted cellular proteins by strongly interacting with their PDZ domains.

9515818|t|Uroplakin II gene is expressed in transitional cell carcinoma but not in bilharzial bladder squamous cell carcinoma: alternative pathways of bladder epithelial differentiation and tumor formation.
9515818|a|Uroplakins (UPs) are integral membrane proteins that are synthesized as the major differentiation products of mammalian urothelium. We have cloned the human UP-II gene and localized it on chromosome 11q23. A survey of 50 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) revealed a UP-II polymorphism but no tumor-specific mutations. Immunohistochemical staining using rabbit antisera against a synthetic peptide of UP-II and against total UPs showed UP reactivity in 39.5% (17 of 43 cases) of conventional TCCs, 12.8% (5 of 39) of bilharzial-related TCCs, and 2.7% (1 of 36) of bilharzial-related squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The finding that fewer bilharzial TCCs express UPs than conventional TCCs (12.8 versus 40%) raised the possibility that the former are heterogeneous, expressing SCC features to varying degrees. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that urothelium can undergo at least three pathways of differentiation: (a) urothelium-type pathway; (b) epidermis-type pathway; and (c) glandular-type pathway, characterized by the production of UPs, K1/K10 keratins, and secreted glycoproteins, respectively. Vitamin A deficiency and mesenchymal factors may play a role in determining the relative contributions of these pathways to urothelial differentiation as well as to the formation of TCC, SCC, and adenocarcinoma, or a mixture thereof.

9543345|t|Human mitochondrial function during cardiac growth and development.
9543345|a|Little information is presently available concerning mitochondrial respiratory and oxidative phosphorylation function in the normal human heart during growth and development. We investigated the levels of specific mitochondrial enzyme activities and content during cardiac growth and development from the early neonatal period (10-20 days) to adulthood (67 years). Biochemical analysis of enzyme specific activities and content and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was performed with left ventricular tissues derived from 30 control individuals. The levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and complex V specific activity, mtDNA copy number and COX subunit II content remained unchanged in contrast to increased citrate synthase (CS) activity and content. The developmental increase in CS activity paralleled increasing CS polypeptide content, but was neither related to overall increases in mitochondrial number nor coordinately regulated with mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities. Our findings of unchanged levels of cardiac mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity during the progression from early childhood to older adult contrasts with the age-specific regulation found with CS, a Krebs cycle mitochondrial enzyme.

9548260|t|Interaction of polyadenylate-binding protein with the eIF4G homologue PAIP enhances translation.
9548260|a|In the initiation of translation in eukaryotes, binding of the small ribosomal subunit to the messenger RNA results from recognition of the 5' cap structure (m7GpppX) of the mRNA by the cap-binding complex eIF4F. eIF4F is itself a three-subunit complex comprising the cap-binding protein eIF4E, eIF4A, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, and eIF4G, which interacts with both eIF4A and eIF4E and enhances cap binding by eIF4E. The mRNA 3' polyadenylate tail and the associated poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) also regulate translational initiation, probably by interacting with the 5' end of the mRNA. In yeast and plants, PABP interacts with eIF4G but no such interaction has been reported in mammalian cells. Here, we describe a new human PABP-interacting protein, PAIP-I, whose sequence is similar to the central portion of eIF4G and which interacts with eIF4A. Overexpression of PAIP-1 in COS-7 cells stimulates translation, perhaps by providing a physical link between the mRNA termini.

9563500|t|Homology between a human apoptosis specific protein and the product of APG5, a gene involved in autophagy in yeast.
9563500|a|Apoptosis specific proteins (ASP) are expressed in the cytoplasm of cultured mammalian cells of various lineages following induction of apoptosis. The cDNA encoding ASP has been cloned from a human expression library and has significant homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae APG5 gene which is essential for yeast autophagy. The ASP gene, known as hAPG5, can be transcribed to give mRNAs of 3.3 kbp, 2.5 kbp and 1.8 kbp which are present at comparable levels in viable and apoptotic cells, demonstrating that protein expression must be regulated at the translational level. These data indicate a possible relationship between apoptosis and autophagy and suggest evolutionary conservation in mammalian apoptosis of a degradative process present in yeast.

9590290|t|Mutations in the human alpha-tectorin gene cause autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment.
9590290|a|The tectorial membrane is an extracellular matrix of the inner ear that contacts the stereocilia bundles of specialized sensory hair cells. Sound induces movement of these hair cells relative to the tectorial membrane, deflects the stereocilia, and leads to fluctuations in hair-cell membrane potential, transducing sound into electrical signals. Alpha-tectorin is one of the major non-collagenous components of the tectorial membrane. Recently, the gene encoding mouse alpha-tectorin (Tecta) was mapped to a region of mouse chromosome 9, which shows evolutionary conservation with human chromosome 11q (ref. 3), where linkage was found in two families, one Belgian (DFNA12; ref. 4) and the other, Austrian (DFNA8; unpublished data), with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment. We determined the complete sequence and the intron-exon structure of the human TECTA gene. In both families, mutation analysis revealed missense mutations which replace conserved amino-acid residues within the zona pellucida domain of TECTA. These findings indicate that mutations in TECTA are responsible for hearing impairment in these families, and implicate a new type of protein in the pathogenesis of hearing impairment.

9618483|t|A 12R-lipoxygenase in human skin: mechanistic evidence, molecular cloning, and expression.
9618483|a|A recognized feature of psoriasis and other proliferative dermatoses is accumulation in the skin of the unusual arachidonic acid metabolite, 12R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HETE). This hydroxy fatty acid is opposite in chirality to the product of the well-known 12S-lipoxygenase and heretofore in mammals is known only as a product of cytochrome P450s. Here we provide mechanistic evidence for a lipoxygenase route to 12R-HETE in human psoriatic tissue and describe a 12R-lipoxygenase that can account for the biosynthesis. Initially we demonstrated retention of the C-12 deuterium of octadeuterated arachidonic acid in its conversion to 12R-HETE in incubations of psoriatic scales, indicating the end product is not formed by isomerization from 12S-H(P)ETE via the 12-keto derivative. Secondly, analysis of product formed from  and -labeled arachidonic acids revealed that 12R-HETE synthesis is associated with stereospecific removal of the pro-R hydrogen from the 10-carbon of arachidonate. This result is compatible with 12R-lipoxygenase-catalyzed formation of 12R-HETE and not with a P450-catalyzed route to 12R-HETE in psoriatic scales. We cloned a lipoxygenase from human keratinocytes; the cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences share  98% 12R in configuration. The 12R-lipoxygenase cDNA is detectable by PCR in psoriatic scales and as a 2.5-kilobase mRNA by Northern analysis of keratinocytes. Identification of this enzyme extends the known distribution of R-lipoxygenases to humans and presents an additional target for potential therapeutic interventions in psoriasis.

9620774|t|A novel homeobox gene PITX3 is mutated in families with autosomal-dominant cataracts and ASMD.
9620774|a|We report here the identification of a new human homeobox gene, PITX3, and its involvement in anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis (ASMD) and congenital cataracts in humans. The PITX3 gene is the human homologue of the mouse Pitx3 gene and is a member of the RIEG/PITX homeobox gene family. The protein encoded by PITX3 shows 99% amino-acid identity to the mouse protein, with 100% identity in the homeodomain and approximately 70% overall identity to other members of this family. We mapped the human PITX3 gene to 10q25 using a radiation-hybrid panel. A collection of 80 DNA samples from individuals with various eye anomalies was screened for mutations in the PITX3 gene. We identified two mutations in independent patients. A 17-bp insertion in the 3'-end of the coding sequence, resulting in a frame shift, occurred in a patient with ASMD and cataracts, and a G-->A substitution, changing a codon for serine into a codon for asparagine, in the 5'-end of the gene occurred in a patient with congenital cataracts. Both mutations cosegregate with the disease phenotype in families, and neither were found in up to 300 control individuals studied. Further expression analysis of Pitx3 in the mouse supports a unique role in early ocular development, with later expression extending to the midbrain, tongue, incisors, sternum, vertebrae and limbs. These data strongly suggest a role for PITX3 in ASMD and cataracts and provide new evidence of the contribution of the RIEG/PITX gene family to the developmental program underpinning normal eye formation.

9637251|t|Human RanBP3, a group of nuclear RanGTP binding proteins.
9637251|a|A group of novel human Ran-binding proteins, RanBP3, was identified using the yeast two-hybrid system via Ran-mediated interaction with the nucleotide exchange factor RCC1. Several open reading frames, representing putative alternatively spliced products, were established by cDNA cloning. Two of them, RanBP3-a and RanBP3-b, encode nuclear hydrophilic proteins of 499 and 562 amino acid residues. The sequences contain FXFG motifs, characteristic of a subgroup of nucleoporins, and a C-terminal domain showing similarity to the Ran-binding protein RanBP1. These proteins are localized in the nucleus, preferentially bind RanGTP and may be nuclear effectors of the Ran pathway.

9637683|t|A stress response pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus requires a novel bifunctional protein kinase/endoribonuclease (Ire1p) in mammalian cells.
9637683|a|Eukaryotes respond to the presence of unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by up-regulating the transcription of genes encoding ER protein chaperones, such as BiP. We have isolated a novel human cDNA encoding a homolog to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ire1p, a proximal sensor for this signal transduction pathway in yeast. The gene product hIre1p is a type 1 transmembrane protein containing a cytoplasmic domain that is highly conserved to the yeast counterpart having a Ser/Thr protein kinase domain and a domain homologous to RNase L. However, the luminal domain has extensively diverged from the yeast gene product. hIre1p expressed in mammalian cells displayed intrinsic autophosphorylation activity and an endoribonuclease activity that cleaved the 5' splice site of yeast HAC1 mRNA, a substrate for the endoribonuclease activity of yeast Ire1p. Overexpressed hIre1p was localized to the ER with particular concentration around the nuclear envelope and some colocalization with the nuclear pore complex. Expression of Ire1p mRNA was autoregulated through a process that required a functional hIre1p kinase activity. Finally, overexpression of wild-type hIre1p constitutively activated a reporter gene under transcriptional control of the rat BiP promoter, whereas expression of a catalytically inactive hIre1p acted in a trans-dominant-negative manner to prevent transcriptional activation of the BiP promoter in response to ER stress induced by inhibition of N-linked glycosylation. These results demonstrate that hIre1p is an essential proximal sensor of the unfolded protein response pathway in mammalian cells.

9647693|t|Atrophin-1, the DRPLA gene product, interacts with two families of WW domain-containing proteins.
9647693|a|Atrophin-1 contains a polyglutamine repeat, expansion of which is responsible for dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The normal function of atrophin-1 is unknown. We have identified five atrophin-1 interacting proteins (AIPs) which bind to atrophin-1 in the vicinity of the polyglutamine tract using the yeast two-hybrid system. Four of the interactions were confirmed using in vitro binding assays. All five interactors contained multiple WW domains. Two are novel. The AIPs can be divided into two distinct classes. AIP1 and AIP3/WWP3 are MAGUK-like multidomain proteins containing a number of protein-protein interaction modules, namely a guanylate kinase-like region, two WW domains, and multiple PDZ domains. AIP2/WWP2, AIP4, and AIP5/WWP1 are highly homologous, each having four WW domains and a HECT domain characteristic of ubiquitin ligases. These interactors are similar to recently isolated huntingtin-interacting proteins, suggesting possible commonality of function between two proteins responsible for very similar diseases.

9647766|t|cDNA sequence and chromosomal localization of the remaining three human nuclear encoded iron sulphur protein (IP) subunits of complex I: the human IP fraction is completed.
9647766|a|NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain can be fragmented in a flavoprotein (FP), iron-sulfur protein (IP), and hydrophobic protein (HP) subfraction. The IP subfraction is hypothesized to be significant, since it contains important prosthetic groups highly conserved among species. We cloned the cDNA of three remaining human NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits of this IP fraction: the NDUFS2 (49 kDa), NDUFS3 (30 kDa), and NDUFS6 (13 kDa) subunits. All presented cDNAs include the complete open reading frame (ORF), which consist of 1392, 795, and 375 base pairs, coding for 463, 264, and 124 amino acids, respectively. The latter show 96, 90, and 83% homology with the corresponding bovine translation products. The 3' untranslated regions (UTR) are complete in all three cDNAs. Polymerase chain reaction performed with DNA isolated from somatic human-rodent cell hybrids containing defined human chromosomes as template gave a human-specific signal which mapped the NDUFS2 and NDUFS3 subunits to chromosomes 1 and 11, respectively. In the case of the NDUFS6 subunit a pseudogene may be present since signals were seen in the lanes containing chromosomes 5 and 6. The NDUFS2 contains a highly conserved protein kinase C phosphorylation site and the NDUFS3 subunit contains a highly conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site which make them strong candidates for future mutation detection studies in enzymatic complex I-deficient patients.

9651357|t|Isolation and characterization of PAGE-1 and GAGE-7. New genes expressed in the LNCaP prostate cancer progression model that share homology with melanoma-associated antigens.
9651357|a|The LNCaP progression model of human prostate cancer consists of lineage-related sublines that differ in their androgen sensitivity and metastatic potential. A differential display polymerase chain reaction was employed to evaluate mRNA expression differences between the LNCaP sublines in order to define the differences in gene expression between the androgen-sensitive, nontumorigenic LNCaP cell line and the androgen-insensitive, metastatic LNCaP sublines, C4-2 and C4-2B. An amplicon, BG16.21, was isolated that showed increased expression in the androgen-independent and metastatic LNCaP sublines, C4-2 and C4-2B. Hybridization screening of a lambda gt11 expression library with BG16.21 revealed two transcripts, both homologous to BG16.21 at the 3' end. A GenBankTM data base search using the GCG Wisconsin software package revealed the shorter approximately 600-bp transcript (designated GAGE-7) to be a new member of the GAGE family. The second approximately 700-bp transcript was a novel gene (designated PAGE-1, "prostate associated gene") with only 45% homology to GAGE gene family members. RNA blot analysis demonstrated that GAGE-7 mRNA was expressed at equal levels in all lineage related prostate cancer cell sublines, while PAGE-1 mRNA levels were elevated 5-fold in C4-2 and C4-2B as compared with LNCaP cells. Neither GAGE-7 nor PAGE-1 demonstrated any regulation by androgens in the prostate cancer cell lines used in this study. PAGE-1 and GAGE-7 expression was found to be restricted to testes (high) and placenta (low) on human multiple tissue Northern blots. As GAGE/MAGE antigens were reported previously to be targets for tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes in melanoma, these results suggest that PAGE-1 and GAGE-7 may be related to prostate cancer progression and may serve as potential targets for novel therapies.

9651585|t|SAP30, a novel protein conserved between human and yeast, is a component of a histone deacetylase complex.
9651585|a|Histone acetylation plays a key role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Recently, histone acetylation and deacetylation were found to be catalyzed by structurally distinct, multisubunit complexes that mediate, respectively, activation and repression of transcription. Here, we identify SAP30 as a novel component of the human histone deacetylase complex that includes Sin3, the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, histone binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48, as well as other polypeptides. Moreover, we describe a SAP30 homolog in yeast that is functionally related to Sin3 and the histone deacetylase Rpd3. The human SAP30 complex is active in deacetylating core histone octamers, but inactive in deacetylating nucleosomal histones due to the inability of the histone binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48 to gain access to nucleosomal histones. These results define SAP30 as a component of a histone deacetylase complex conserved among eukaryotic organisms.

9694715|t|A novel human actin-binding protein homologue that binds to platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha.
9694715|a|Glycoprotein (GP)Ib-IX-V is one of the major transmembrane complexes present on the platelet surface. Its extracellular domain binds von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombin, while its intracellular domain associates tightly with the cytoskeleton through the actin-binding protein (ABP)-280, also known as filamin. In the present study, a full-length cDNA coding for a human ABP homologue has been cloned and sequenced. This protein was identified by the yeast two-hybrid screening procedure via its interaction with the intracellular domain of GPIbalpha. Initially, a 1.3-kb partial cDNA was isolated from a megakaryocyte-like cell line (K562) cDNA library followed by a full-length cDNA of 9.4 kb that was identified in a human placenta library. The full-length cDNA encoded a protein of 2,578 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 276 kD (ABP-276). The amino terminal 248 amino acids contained an apparent actin binding domain followed by 24 tandem repeats each containing about 96 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the protein shared a high degree of homology with human endothelial ABP-280 (70% identity) and chicken filamin (83% identity). However, the 32 amino acid Hinge I region in ABP-280 that contains a calpain cleavage site conferring flexibility on the molecule, was absent in the homologue. An isoform containing a 24 amino acid insertion with a unique sequence at the missing Hinge I region was also identified (ABP-278). This isoform resulted from alternative RNA splicing. ABP-276 and/or ABP-278 were present in all tissues examined, but the relative amount varied in that some tissue contained both forms, while other tissue contained predominately one or the other.

9721204|t|New eukaryotic semaphorins with close homology to semaphorins of DNA viruses.
9721204|a|Semaphorins were initially described as a family of repulsive guidance molecules in embryonal development. Their basic structure consists of an N-terminal signal sequence, the defining semaphorin domain ofapproximately 500 amino acids, an Ig-like domain,and a variable carboxy-terminus. We recently described a viral semaphorin homologue encoded by the alcelaphine herpesvirus type 1. Less conserved, truncated homologues were also identified in poxviruses. Here we describe new human and murine semaphorin homologues. The respective genes were cloned and sequenced, and they were termed H-Sema-L and M-Sema-L (HGMW-approved symbols SEMAL and Semal, respectively). A multiply spliced mRNA of 3.2 kb is expressed in human placenta, spleen, thymus, and gonadal tissue. H-Sema-L maps to chromosome 15q22.3-q23 and M-Sema-L to the homologous locus 9A3.3-B in the mouse genome. The expression patterns and the presence of related genes in large DNA viruses suggest that this new semaphorin has a relevant function in the immune system.   Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

9721215|t|cDNA cloning and chromosomal localization of the human and mouse isoforms of Ksp-cadherin.
9721215|a|Ksp-cadherin is a novel kidney-specific member of the cadherin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. We have determined the complete cDNA coding sequences of both the human and the mouse isoforms of Ksp-cadherin. The inferred amino acid sequences of the human and mouse isoforms are 79 and 75% identical to the originally described rabbit isoform of Ksp-cadherin (Thomson et al., 1995; J. Biol. Chem. 270, 17594-17601), respectively. The relative locations of cadherin-specific sequence motifs, putative N-glycosylation sites, and characteristic protein domains are entirely conserved in all three isoforms. Multiple organ Northern analyses indicate that, as in the rabbit, both the human and the mouse Ksp-cadherin transcripts appear to have distinct kidney-specific distributions. The human Ksp-cadherin gene (CDH16) maps to chromosome 16q21-proximal 16q22. The mouse Ksp-cadherin gene (Cdh16) was localized to a highly syntenic region of distal Chromosome 8. Both the human and the mouse Ksp-cadherin genes were localized to previously identified clusters of cadherin gene sequences, consistent with the hypothesis that most cadherin family members arose by gene duplication from a single ancestral gene at a relatively early stage in the evolution of the mammalian genome.

9731181|t|ZK1, a novel Kr ppel-type zinc finger gene, is induced following exposure to ionizing radiation and enhances apoptotic cell death on hematopoietic cells.
9731181|a|To identify and early response factor by exposure to ionizing radiation, we cloned the cDNA of a novel Kr ppel-type zinc finger (ZNF) gene, ZK1, from a cDNA library constructed from the human leukemia cell line, CMK86, using degenerate primers. This cDNA encoded a protein of 671 amino acids with an A box of Kr ppel-associated box (KRAB) domain at the N-terminus, followed by 15 ZNF motifs. The expression level of the ZK1 mRNA in human leukemia cells lines, CMK86 and U937, was increased after exposure to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, murine myeloid precursor 32D cells that were stably transfected with ZK1 cDNA had higher sensitivity to ionizing radiation than the 32D parent cells. These data suggest that the ZK1 gene is one of early response genes by exposure to ionizing radiation, and may have some functions on radiation-induced apoptotic cell death on hematopoietic cells.

9748262|t|Homeodomain-interacting protein kinases, a novel family of co-repressors for homeodomain transcription factors.
9748262|a|A novel family of cofactors that differentially interact with homeoproteins have been identified via a yeast two-hybrid screen. The proteins contain a conserved protein kinase domain that is separated from a domain that interacts with homeoproteins and hence are termed homeodomain-interacting protein kinases (HIPKs): HIPK1, HIPK2, and HIPK3. We show that HIPKs are nuclear kinases using GFP-HIPK fusion constructs. The DNA binding activity of the NK-3 homeoprotein is greatly enhanced by HIPK2, but this effect is independent of its phosphorylation by HIPK2. In cultured cells, HIPKs localize to nuclear speckles and potentiate the repressor activities of NK homeoproteins. The co-repressor activity of HIPKs depends on both its homeodomain interaction domain and a co-repressor domain that maps to the N terminus. Thus, HIPKs represent a heretofore undescribed family of co-repressors for homeodomain transcription factors.

9763455|t|The cytoplasmic zinc finger protein ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus of proliferating cells.
9763455|a|The zinc finger protein ZPR1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after treatment of cells with mitogens. The function of nuclear ZPR1 has not been defined. Here we demonstrate that ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus of proliferating cells. The role of ZPR1 was examined using a gene disruption strategy. Cells lacking ZPR1 are not viable. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the loss of ZPR1 caused disruption of nucleolar function, including preribosomal RNA expression. These data establish ZPR1 as an essential protein that is required for normal nucleolar function in proliferating cells.

9774969|t|p63, a p53 homolog at 3q27-29, encodes multiple products with transactivating, death-inducing, and dominant-negative activities.
9774969|a|We describe the cloning of p63, a gene at chromosome 3q27-29 that bears strong homology to the tumor suppressor p53 and to the related gene, p73. p63 was detected in a variety of human and mouse tissues, including proliferating basal cells of epithelial layers in the epidermis, cervix, urothelium, and prostate. Unlike p53, the p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. Importantly, the predominant p63 isotypes in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. We demonstrate that these truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63, and we suggest the possibility of physiological interactions among members of the p53 family.

9782094|t|Coding sequence and expression patterns of mouse chordin and mapping of the cognate mouse chrd and human CHRD genes.
9782094|a|Chordin is a key developmental protein that dorsalizes early vertebrate embryonic tissues by binding to ventralizing TGF-beta-like bone morphogenetic proteins and sequestering them in latent complexes. Here we report the first characterization of mammalian chordin. The full-length cDNA sequence for mouse chordin is given, and RNA blot analysis shows the murine chordin gene Chrd to be expressed at relatively high levels in 7-day postcoitum mouse embryos and at much decreased levels at later developmental times and in adult tissues. These results imply a major role for chordin during gastrulation of the mammalian embryo. Nevertheless, both murine and human chordin genes are shown to be expressed at readily detectable levels in several fetal and adult tissues, most notably liver and cerebellum, suggesting additional roles in organogenesis and homeostasis. Chrd was mapped to mouse chromosome 16 using interspecific crosses, and the cognate human gene CHRD was localized to human chromosome 3q27 by radiation hybrid mapping.

9786908|t|Cloning and characterization of a novel human hepatocyte transcription factor, hB1F, which binds and activates enhancer II of hepatitis B virus.
9786908|a|Enhancer II (ENII) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the essential cis-elements for the transcriptional regulation of HBV gene expression. Its function is highly liver-specific, suggesting that liver-enriched transcriptional factors play critical roles in regulating the activity of ENII. In this report, a novel hepatocyte transcription factor, which binds specifically to the B1 region (AACGACCGACCTTGAG) within the major functional unit (B unit) of ENII, has been cloned from a human liver cDNA library by yeast one-hybrid screening, and demonstrated to trans-activate ENII via the B1 region. We named this factor hB1F, for human B1-binding factor. Amino acid analysis revealed this factor structurally belongs to nuclear receptor superfamily. Based on the sequence similarities, hB1F is characterized to be a novel human homolog of the orphan receptor fushi tarazu factor I (FTZ-F1). Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, a splicing isoform of hB1F (hB1F-2) was identified, which has an extra 46 amino acid residues in the A/B region. Examination of the tissue distribution has revealed an abundant 5.2-kilobase transcript of hB1F is present specifically in human pancreas and liver. Interestingly, an additional transcript of 3.8 kilobases was found to be present in hepatoma cells HepG2. Fluorescent in situ hybridization has mapped the gene locus of hB1F to the region q31-32.1 of human chromosome 1. Altogether, this study provides the first report that a novel human homolog of FTZ-F1 binds and regulates ENII of HBV. The potential roles of this FTZ-F1 homolog in tissue-specific gene regulation, in embryonic development, as well as in liver carcinogenesis are discussed.

9787077|t|Organization and evolution of olfactory receptor genes on human chromosome 11.
9787077|a|Olfactory receptors (OR) are encoded by a large multigene family including hundreds of members dispersed throughout the human genome. Cloning and mapping studies have determined that a large proportion of the olfactory receptor genes are located on human chromosomes 6, 11, and 17, as well as distributed on other chromosomes. In this paper, we describe and characterize the organization of olfactory receptor genes on human chromosome 11 by using degenerate PCR-based probes to screen chromosome 11-specific and whole genome clone libraries for members of the OR gene family. OR genes were identified by DNA sequencing and then localized to regions of chromosome 11. Physical maps of several gene clusters were constructed to determine the chromosomal relationships between various members of the family. This work identified 25 new OR genes located on chromosome 11 in at least seven distinct regions. Three of these regions contain gene clusters that include additional members of this gene family not yet identified by sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the newly described OR genes suggests a mechanism for the generation of genetic diversity.

9827804|t|A family of stress-inducible GADD45-like proteins mediate activation of the stress-responsive MTK1/MEKK4 MAPKKK.
9827804|a|The stress-responsive p38 and JNK MAPK pathways regulate cell cycle and apoptosis. A human MAPKKK, MTK1 (= MEKK4), mediates activation of both p38 and JNK in response to environmental stresses. Using a yeast two-hybrid method, three related proteins, GADD45alpha (= GADD45), GADD45, (= MyD118), and GADD45gamma, were identified that bound to an N-terminal domain of MTK1. These proteins activated MTK1 kinase activity, both in vivo and in vitro. The GADD45-like genes are induced by environmental stresses, including MMS, UV, and gamma irradiation. Expression of the GADD45-like genes induces p38/JNK activation and apoptosis, which can be partially suppressed by coexpression of a dominant inhibitory MTK1 mutant protein. We propose that the GADD45-like proteins mediate activation of the p38/JNK pathway, via MTK1/ MEKK4, in response to environmental stresses.

9829980|t|Diva, a Bcl-2 homologue that binds directly to Apaf-1 and induces BH3-independent cell death.
9829980|a|We have identified and characterized Diva, which is a novel regulator of apoptosis. Sequence analysis revealed that Diva is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins containing Bcl-2 homology domain 1, 2, 3, and 4 (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4) regions and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain. The expression of Diva mRNA was detected in multiple embryonic tissues but was restricted to the ovary and testis in adult mice. The expression of Diva promoted the death of 293T, Ramsey, and T47D cells as well as that of primary sensory neurons, indicating that Diva is a proapoptotic protein. Significantly, Diva lacks critical residues in the conserved BH3 region that mediate the interaction between BH3-containing proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues and their prosurvival binding partners. Consistent with this, Diva did not bind to cellular Bcl-2 family members including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1/Bfl-1. Furthermore, mutants of Diva lacking the BH3 region fully retained their proapoptotic activity, confirming that Diva promotes apoptosis in a BH3-independent manner. Significantly, Diva interacted with a viral Bcl-2 homologue (vBcl-2) encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Consistent with these associations, apoptosis induced by Diva was inhibited by vBcl-2 but not by Bcl-XL. Importantly, Diva interacted with Apaf-1, an adapter molecule that activates caspase-9, a central death protease of the apoptotic pathway. The expression of Diva inhibited the binding of Bcl-XL to Apaf-1, as determined by immunoprecipitation assays. Thus, Diva represents a novel type of proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologue that promotes apoptosis independently of the BH3 region through direct binding to Apaf-1, thus preventing Bcl-XL from binding to the caspase-9 regulator Apaf-1.

9843512|t|Nhp2p and Nop10p are essential for the function of H/ACA snoRNPs.
9843512|a|The small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles containing H/ACA-type snoRNAs (H/ACA snoRNPs) are crucial trans-acting factors intervening in eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis. Most of these particles generate the site-specific pseudouridylation of rRNAs while a subset are required for 18S rRNA synthesis. To understand in detail how these particles carry out these functions, all of their protein components have to be characterized. For that purpose, we have affinity-purified complexes containing epitope-tagged Gar1p protein, previously shown to be part of H/ACA snoRNPs. Under the conditions used, three polypeptides of 65, 22 and 10 kDa apparent molecular weight specifically copurify with epitope-tagged Gar1p. The 22 and 10 kDa polypeptides were identified as Nhp2p and a novel protein we termed Nop10p, respectively. Both proteins are conserved, essential and present in the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus. Nhp2p and Nop10p are specifically associated with all H/ACA snoRNAs and are essential to the function of H/ACA snoRNPs. Cells lacking Nhp2p or Nop10p are impaired in global rRNA pseudouridylation and in the A1 and A2 cleavage steps of the pre-rRNA required for the synthesis of mature 18S rRNA. These phenotypes are probably a direct consequence of the instability of H/ACA snoRNAs and Gar1p observed in cells deprived of Nhp2p or Nop10p. Our results suggest that Nhp2p and Nop10p, together with Cbf5p, constitute the core of H/ACA snoRNPs.

9874765|t|CIR, a corepressor linking the DNA binding factor CBF1 to the histone deacetylase complex.
9874765|a|CBF1 is a member of the CSL family of DNA binding factors, which mediate either transcriptional repression or transcriptional activation. CSL proteins play a central role in Notch signaling and in Epstein-Barr virus-induced immortalization. Notch is a transmembrane protein involved in cell-fate decisions, and the cytoplasmic domain of Notch (NotchIC) targets CBF1. The Epstein-Barr virus-immortalizing protein EBNA2 activates both cellular and viral gene expression by targeting CBF1 and mimicking NotchIC. We have examined the mechanism of CBF1-mediated repression and show that CBF1 binds to a unique corepressor, CBF1 interacting corepressor (CIR). A CIR homolog is encoded by Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that CIR is evolutionarily conserved. Two CBF1 mutants that were unable to bind CIR did not function as repressors, suggesting that targeting of CIR to CBF1 is an important component of repression. When expressed as a Gal4 fusion protein, CIR repressed reporter gene expression. CIR binds to histone deacetylase and to SAP30 and serves as a linker between CBF1 and the histone deacetylase complex.

9878755|t|Cloning and characterization of CRF, a novel C1q-related factor, expressed in areas of the brain involved in motor function.
9878755|a|We have isolated and characterized a novel cDNA, C1q-Related Factor (CRF), that is predicted to encode a 258 amino acid polypeptide with a hydrophobic signal sequence, a collagenous region, and a globular domain at the carboxy terminus that shares homology to the C1q signature domain. Human CRF transcript is expressed at highest levels in the brain, particularly in the brainstem. In situ hybridization to mouse brain sections demonstrated that CRF transcripts are most abundant in areas of the nervous system involved in motor function, such as the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the accessory olivary nucleus, the pons and the red nucleus. The mouse CRF homolog is highly similar to the human gene at both the nucleotide and protein level, suggesting an important conserved role for this protein.   Copyright 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

9892355|t|GABA(A)-receptor-associated protein links GABA(A) receptors and the cytoskeleton.
9892355|a|Type-A receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission. Each subunit of the pentameric receptor protein has ligand-binding sites in the amino-terminal extracellular domain and four membrane-spanning regions, one of which forms a wall of the ion channel. Each subunit also has a large intracellular loop that may be a target for protein kinases and be required for subcellular targeting and membrane clustering of the receptor, perhaps by anchoring the receptor to the cytoskeleton. Neurotransmitter receptors need to be positioned in high density in the cell membrane at sites postsynaptic to nerve terminals releasing that neurotransmitter. Other members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion-channel receptors associate in postsynaptic-membrane clusters by binding to the proteins rapsyn or gephyrin. Here we identify a new cellular protein, GABA(A)-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), which can interact with the gamma2 subunit of GABA(A) receptors. GABARAP binds to GABA(A) receptors both in vitro and in vivo, and co-localizes with the punctate staining of GABA(A) receptors on cultured cortical neurons. Sequence analysis shows similarity between GABARAP and light chain-3 of microtubule-associated proteins 1A and 1B. Moreover, the N terminus of GABARAP is highly positively charged and features a putative tubulin-binding motif. The interactions among GABA(A) receptors, GABARAP and tubulin suggest a mechanism for the targeting and clustering of GABA(A) receptors.

9932288|t|Cloning, gene structure and genomic localization of an orphan transporter from mouse kidney with six alternatively-spliced isoforms.
9932288|a|Two genes were identified and characterized that express cDNAs related to previously identified neurotransmitter and/or osmolyte transporters, but which are expressed specifically in the kidney. RNA transcribed from one of these two genes (XT2) was found to undergo an extensive degree of alternative splicing to generate six distinct isoforms. The intron-exon structure of the XT2 gene and the sites of alternative splicing were identified. Expression of the second gene (XT3) was found to be conserved in human kidney, and partial sequence was obtained from a human cDNA library. The expressions of both XT2 and XT3 RNAs were determined in mouse and human tissues, respectively, and the locations of the two genes within the mouse genome were identified. Screening experiments to identify the substrate(s) of these proteins failed to identify specific uptake with any of the tested compounds; however, immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated that epitope-tagged variants of the protein products of the XT2 and XT3 cDNAs were present on the plasma membrane of transfected cells.
