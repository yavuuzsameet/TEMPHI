20059956|t|A Drosophila insulin-like peptide promotes growth during nonfeeding states.
20059956|a|In metazoans, tissue growth relies on the availability of nutrients--stored internally or obtained from the environment--and the resulting activation of insulin/IGF signaling (IIS). In Drosophila, growth is mediated by seven Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps), acting through a canonical IIS pathway. During the larval period, animals feed and Dilps produced by the brain couple nutrient uptake with systemic growth. We show here that, during metamorphosis, when feeding stops, a specific DILP (Dilp6) is produced by the fat body and relays the growth signal. Expression of DILP6 during pupal development is controlled by the steroid hormone ecdysone. Remarkably, DILP6 expression is also induced upon starvation, and both its developmental and environmental expression require the Drosophila FoxO transcription factor. This study reveals a specific class of ILPs induced upon metabolic stress that promotes growth in conditions of nutritional deprivation or following developmentally induced cessation of feeding.

21238926|t|Brat promotes stem cell differentiation via control of a bistable switch that restricts BMP signaling.
21238926|a|Drosophila ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) are maintained by Dpp signaling and the Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos) translational repressors. Upon division, Dpp signaling is extinguished, and Nos is downregulated in one daughter cell, causing it to switch to a differentiating cystoblast (CB). However, downstream effectors of Pum-Nos remain unknown, and how CBs lose their responsiveness to Dpp is unclear. Here, we identify Brain Tumor (Brat) as a potent differentiation factor and target of Pum-Nos regulation. Brat is excluded from GSCs by Pum-Nos but functions with Pum in CBs to translationally repress distinct targets, including the Mad and dMyc mRNAs. Regulation of both targets simultaneously lowers cellular responsiveness to Dpp signaling, forcing the cell to become refractory to the self-renewal signal. Mathematical modeling elucidates bistability of cell fate in the Brat-mediated system, revealing how autoregulation of GSC number can arise from Brat coupling extracellular Dpp regulation to intracellular interpretation.

22729903|t|Contribution of STAT4 gene single-nucleotide polymorphism to systemic lupus erythematosus in the Polish population.
22729903|a|The STAT4 has been found to be a susceptible gene in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in various populations. There are evident population differences in the context of clinical manifestations of SLE, therefore we investigated the prevalence of the STAT4 G > C (rs7582694) polymorphism in patients with SLE (n = 253) and controls (n = 521) in a sample of the Polish population. We found that patients with the STAT4 C/G and CC genotypes exhibited a 1.583-fold increased risk of SLE incidence (95 % CI = 1.168-2.145, p = 0.003), with OR for the C/C versus C/G and G/G genotypes was 1.967 (95 % CI = 1.152-3.358, p = 0.0119). The OR for the STAT4 C allele frequency showed a 1.539-fold increased risk of SLE (95 % CI = 1.209-1.959, p = 0.0004). We also observed an increased frequency of STAT4 C/C and C/G genotypes in SLE patients with renal symptoms OR = 2.259 (1.365-3.738, p = 0.0014), (p (corr) = 0.0238) and in SLE patients with neurologic manifestations OR = 2.867 (1.467-5.604, p = 0.0016), (p (corr) = 0.0272). Moreover, we found a contribution of STAT4 C/C and C/G genotypes to the presence of the anti-snRNP Ab OR = 3.237 (1.667-6.288, p = 0.0003), (p (corr) = 0.0051) and the presence of the anti-Scl-70 Ab OR = 2.665 (1.380-5.147, p = 0.0028), (p (corr) = 0.0476). Our studies confirmed an association of the STAT4 C (rs7582694) variant with the development of SLE and occurrence of some clinical manifestations of the disease.

23085491|t|The hereditary spastic paraplegia protein strumpellin: characterisation in neurons and of the effect of disease mutations on WASH complex assembly and function.
23085491|a|Mutations in the gene encoding strumpellin cause autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), in which there is degeneration of corticospinal tract axons. Strumpellin is a component of the WASH complex, an actin-regulating complex that is recruited to endosomes by interactions with the retromer complex. The WASH complex and its relationship to retromer have not been fully characterised in neurons, and the molecular pathological mechanism of strumpellin mutation is unclear. Here we demonstrate that the WASH complex assembles in the brain, where it interacts with retromer. Members of both complexes co-localise with each other and with endosomes in primary cortical neurons, and are present in somato-dendritic and axonal compartments. We show that strumpellin is not required for normal transferrin receptor traffic, but is required for the correct subcellular distribution of the b-2-adrenergic receptor. However, strumpellin disease mutations do not affect its incorporation into the WASH complex or its subcellular localisation, nor do they have a dominant effect on functions of the WASH complex, including regulation of endosomal tubulation, transferrin receptor traffic or b-2-adrenergic receptor localisation. Models of the WASH complex indicate that it contains a single strumpellin molecule, so in patients with strumpellin mutations, complexes containing wild-type and mutant strumpellin should be present in equal numbers. In most cell types this would provide sufficient functional WASH to allow normal cellular physiology. However, owing to the demands on membrane traffic imposed by their exceptionally long axons, we suggest that corticospinal neurons are especially vulnerable to reductions in functional WASH.

23118027|t|The immunoglobulin domain of the sodium channel b3 subunit contains a surface-localized disulfide bond that is required for homophilic binding.
23118027|a|The b subunits of voltage-gated sodium (Na(v)) channels possess an extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domain that is related to the L1 family of cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs). Here we show that in HEK293 cells, secretion of the free Ig domain of the b3 subunit is reduced significantly when it is coexpressed with the full-length b3 and b1 subunits but not with the b2 subunit. Using immunoprecipitation, we show that the b3 subunit can mediate trans homophilic-binding via its Ig domain and that the b3-Ig domain can associate heterophilically with the b1 subunit. Evolutionary tracing analysis and structural modeling identified a cluster of surface-localized amino acids fully conserved between the Ig domains of all known b3 and b1 sequences. A notable feature of this conserved surface cluster is the presence of two adjacent cysteine residues that previously we have suggested may form a disulfide bond. We now confirm the presence of the disulfide bond in b3 using mass spectrometry, and we show that its integrity is essential for the association of the full-length, membrane-anchored b3 subunit with itself. However, selective reduction of this surface disulfide bond did not inhibit homophilic binding of the purified b3-Ig domain in free solution. Hence, the disulfide bond itself is unlikely to be part of the homophilic binding site. Rather, we suggest that its integrity ensures the Ig domain of the membrane-tethered b3 subunit adopts the correct orientation for productive association to occur in vivo.

23195221|t|Scribble is required for normal epithelial cell-cell contacts and lumen morphogenesis in the mammalian lung.
23195221|a|During lung development, proper epithelial cell arrangements are critical for the formation of an arborized network of tubes. Each tube requires a lumen, the diameter of which must be tightly regulated to enable optimal lung function. Lung branching and lumen morphogenesis require close epithelial cell-cell contacts that are maintained as a result of adherens junctions, tight junctions and by intact apical-basal (A/B) polarity. However, the molecular mechanisms that maintain epithelial cohesion and lumen diameter in the mammalian lung are unknown. Here we show that Scribble, a protein implicated in planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling, is necessary for normal lung morphogenesis. Lungs of the Scrib mouse mutant Circletail (Crc) are abnormally shaped with fewer airways, and these airways often lack a visible, 'open' lumen. Mechanistically we show that Scrib genetically interacts with the core PCP gene Vangl2 in the developing lung and that the distribution of PCP pathway proteins and Rho mediated cytoskeletal modification is perturbed in Scrib(Crc/Crc) lungs. However A/B polarity, which is disrupted in Drosophila Scrib mutants, is largely unaffected. Notably, we find that Scrib mediates functions not attributed to other PCP proteins in the lung. Specifically, Scrib localises to both adherens and tight junctions of lung epithelia and knockdown of Scrib in lung explants and organotypic cultures leads to reduced cohesion of lung epithelial cells. Live imaging of Scrib knockdown lungs shows that Scrib does not affect bud bifurcation, as previously shown for the PCP protein Celsr1, but is required to maintain epithelial cohesion. To understand the mechanism leading to reduced cell-cell association, we show that Scrib associates with b-catenin in embryonic lung and the sub-cellular distribution of adherens and tight junction proteins is perturbed in mutant lung epithelia. Our data reveal that Scrib is required for normal lung epithelial organisation and lumen morphogenesis by maintaining cell-cell contacts. Thus we reveal novel and important roles for Scrib in lung development operating via the PCP pathway, and in regulating junctional complexes and cell cohesion.

23219801|t|What can naturally occurring mutations tell us about Ca(v)1.x channel function?
23219801|a|Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels allow for Ca2+-dependent intracellular signaling by directly mediating Ca2+ ion influx, by physical coupling to intracellular Ca2+ release channels or functional coupling to other ion channels such as Ca2+ activated potassium channels. L-type Ca2+ channels that comprise the family of Ca(v)1 channels are expressed in many electrically excitable tissues and are characterized by their unique sensitivity to dihydropyridines. In this issue, we summarize genetic defects in L-type Ca2+ channels and analyze their role in human diseases (Ca2+ channelopathies); e.g. mutations in Ca(v)1.2 a1 cause Timothy and Brugada syndrome, mutations in Ca(v)1.3 a1 are linked to sinoatrial node dysfunction and deafness while mutations in Ca(v)1.4 a1 are associated with X-linked retinal disorders such as an incomplete form of congenital stationary night blindness. Herein, we also put the mutations underlying the channel's dysfunction into the structural context of the pore-forming a1 subunit. This analysis highlights the importance of combining functional data with structural analysis to gain a deeper understanding for the disease pathophysiology as well as for physiological channel function.

23254194|t|Gastric expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 is associated with hyperphagia and obesity in mice.
23254194|a|The adipokine plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 is increased in plasma of obese individuals and exhibits increased expression in the stomachs of individuals infected with Helicobacter. To investigate the relevance of gastric PAI-1, we used 1.1 kb of the H(+)/K(+)b subunit promoter to overexpress PAI-1 specifically in mouse gastric parietal cells (PAI-1-H/Kb mice). We studied the physiological, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics of these and mice null for PAI-1 or a putative receptor, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). PAI-1-H/Kb mice had increased plasma concentrations of PAI-1 and increased body mass, adiposity, and hyperphagia compared with wild-type mice. In the latter, food intake was inhibited by cholecystokinin (CCK)8s, but PAI-1-H/Kb mice were insensitive to the satiating effects of CCK8s. PAI-1-H/Kb mice also had significantly reduced expression of c-fos in the nucleus tractus solitarius in response to CCK8s and refeeding compared with wild-type mice. Exogenous PAI-1 reversed the effects of CCK8s on food intake and c-fos levels in the nucleus tractus solitarius of wild-type mice, but not uPAR-null mice. Infection of C57BL/6 mice with Helicobacter felis increased gastric abundance of PAI-1 and reduced the satiating effects of CCK8s, whereas the response to CCK8s was maintained in infected PAI-1-null mice. In cultured vagal afferent neurons, PAI-1 inhibited stimulation of neuropeptide Y type 2 receptor (Y2R) expression by CCK8s. Thus, gastric expression of PAI-1 is associated with hyperphagia, moderate obesity, and resistance to the satiating effects of CCK indicating a new role in suppressing signals from the upper gut that inhibit food intake.

23639442|t|The neuropilin 1 cytoplasmic domain is required for VEGF-A-dependent arteriogenesis.
23639442|a|Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) plays an important but ill-defined role in VEGF-A signaling and vascular morphogenesis. We show that mice with a knockin mutation that ablates the NRP1 cytoplasmic tail (Nrp1(cyto)) have normal angiogenesis but impaired developmental and adult arteriogenesis. The arteriogenic defect was traced to the absence of a PDZ-dependent interaction between NRP1 and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) complex and synectin, which delayed trafficking of endocytosed VEGFR2 from Rab5+ to EAA1+ endosomes. This led to increased PTPN1 (PTP1b)-mediated dephosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Y(1175), the site involved in activating ERK signaling. The Nrp1(cyto) mutation also impaired endothelial tubulogenesis in vitro, which could be rescued by expressing full-length NRP1 or constitutively active ERK. These results demonstrate that the NRP1 cytoplasmic domain promotes VEGFR2 trafficking in a PDZ-dependent manner to regulate arteriogenic ERK signaling and establish a role for NRP1 in VEGF-A signaling during vascular morphogenesis.

23677713|t|Telomerase downregulation induces proapoptotic genes expression and initializes breast cancer cells apoptosis followed by DNA fragmentation in a cell type dependent manner.
23677713|a|The aim of the study was to analyze the consequence of silencing genes coding for the key subunits of the telomerase complex, i.e. TERT, TERC and TP1 in human breast cancer MCF7 and MDA-MB-231cells. The transfection was performed using Lipofectamine2000 and pooled siRNAs. The cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative effect of siRNA was measured by the SRB assay, the cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation by TUNEL analysis. Telomerase activity was assessed by TRAP, followed by PAGE and ELISA assays. Telomerase downregulation was also assessed using qPCR in order to estimate the changes in the expression profile of genes engaged in apoptosis. It was revealed that treatment of breast cancer cells with different siRNAs (100 nM) resulted in a cell type and time-dependent effects. The downregulation of telomerase subunits was followed by reduction of telomerase activity down to almost 60% compared to control cells. However, a significant effect was only observed when the TERT subunit was downregulated. Its silencing resulted in a significant (p<0.05) increase of apoptosis (over 10% in MCF7 and about 5% in MDA-MB-231 cells, corresponding to the Annexin V assay) and DNA fragmentation (almost 30% in MCF7 and over 25% in MDA-MB-231 cells). Interestingly, also several proapoptotic genes were induced after the downregulation of the key telomerase subunit, including Bax, Bik or caspase-1 and caspase-14, as well as NGFR and TNFSF10 which were upregulated twice and more.

23750584|t|Arabidopsis CHROMOSOME TRANSMISSION FIDELITY 7 (AtCTF7/ECO1) is required for DNA repair, mitosis and meiosis.
23750584|a|The proper transmission of DNA in dividing cells is crucial for the survival of eukaryotic organisms. During cell division, faithful segregation of replicated chromosomes requires their tight attachment, known as sister chromatid cohesion, until anaphase. Sister chromatid cohesion is established during S-phase in a process requiring an acetyltransferase that in yeast is known as Establishment of cohesion 1 (Eco1). Inactivation of Eco1 typically disrupts chromosome segregation and homologous recombination-dependent DNA repair in dividing cells, ultimately resulting in lethality. We report here the isolation and detailed characterization of two homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants for the Arabidopsis thaliana Eco1 homolog, CHROMOSOME TRANSMISSION FIDELITY 7/ESTABLISHMENT OF COHESION 1 (CTF7/ECO1), called ctf7-1 and ctf7-2. Mutants exhibited dwarfism, poor anther development and sterility. Analysis of somatic tissues by flow cytometry, scanning electron microscopy and quantitative real-time PCR identified defects in DNA repair and cell division, including an increase in the area of leaf epidermal cells, an increase in DNA content and the upregulation of genes involved in DNA repair including BRCA1 and PARP2. No significant change was observed in the expression of genes that influence entry into the endocycle. Analysis of meiocytes identified changes in chromosome morphology and defective segregation; the abundance of chromosomal-bound cohesion subunits was also reduced. Transcript levels for several meiotic genes, including the recombinase genes DMC1 and RAD51C and the S-phase licensing factor CDC45 were elevated in mutant anthers. Taken together our results demonstrate that Arabidopsis CTF7/ECO1 plays important roles in the preservation of genome integrity and meiosis.

23934545|t|Loss of PPARg expression in mammary secretory epithelial cells creates a pro-breast tumorigenic environment.
23934545|a|Breast cancer is the leading cause of new cancer diagnoses among women. Using peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)g((+/-)) mice, we showed normal expression of PPARg was critical to stop 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast tumorigenesis. PPARg is expressed in many breast cell types including mammary secretory epithelial (MSE) cells. MSEs proliferate as required during pregnancy, and undergo apoptosis or reversible transdifferentiation during involution once lactation is complete. Thus, MSE-specific loss of PPARg was hypothesized to enhance DMBA-mediated breast tumorigenesis. To test this, MSE cell-specific PPARg knockout (PPARg-MSE KO) and control (PPARg-WT) mice were generated, mated and allowed to nurse for three days. One week after involution, dams were treated with DMBA to initiate breast tumors, and randomized on week 7 to continue receiving a normal chow diet (DMBA Only: PPARg-WT, n = 15; PPARg-MSE KO, n = 25) or one supplemented with a PPARg activating drug (DMBA + ROSI: PPARg-WT, n = 17; PPARg-MSE KO, n = 24), and monitored for changes in breast tumor outcomes. PPARg-MSE KOs had significantly lower overall survival and decreased mammary tumor latency as compared to PPARg-WT controls. PPARg activation significantly reduced DMBA-mediated malignant mammary tumor volumes irrespective of genotype. MSE-specific PPARg loss resulted in decreased mammary gland expression of PTEN and Bax, increased superoxide anion production, and elevated serum eotaxin and RANTES, creating a protumorigenic environment. Moreover, PPARg activation in MSEs delayed mammary tumor growth in part by down-regulating Cox-1, Cox-2 and cyclin D1. Collectively, these studies highlight a protective role of MSE-specific PPARg during breast tumorigenesis, and support a novel chemotherapeutic role of PPARg activation in breast cancer.

24142065|t|Common polymorphism (81Val>Ile) and rare mutations (257Arg>Ser and 335Ile>Ser) of the MC3R gene in obese Polish children and adolescents.
24142065|a|The predisposing role to human obesity of the MC3R gene polymorphism is controversial. In this report we present the first study focused on the search for the MC3R polymorphism in the Polish population. Altogether 257 obese children and adolescents (RBMI>120) and 94 adults, who were never obese or overweight (BMI<25), were studied. For all subjects the entire coding sequence was analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. One common polymorphism (81Val>Ile) and two rare mutations (257Arg>Ser and 335Ile>Ser) were identified. The common polymorphism was widely distributed in the obese and control cohorts, while the mutations were identified in four obese subjects only. In case of the 335Ile>Ser substitution a three-generation family, consisting of 20 members, was also analyzed. It was found that all carriers of the 335Ser mutation were obese, but among non-carriers obese subjects also were found. Our study suggests that the predisposing effect to obesity of the 81Ile polymorphic variant is rather unlikely. With regard to the studied rare mutations we suggest that the 335Ser allele may have a small predisposing effect.

24442316|t|Cultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis protects liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in acute liver injured mice.
24442316|a|Cultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis (CMCS) was widely used for a variety of diseases including liver injury, the current study aims to investigate the protective effects of CMCS on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in acute injury liver and related action mechanisms. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine (D-GalN). 39 male BABL/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: normal control, model control, CMCS treatment and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment groups. The Serum liver function parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were assayed with the commercial kit. The inflammation and scaffold structure in liver were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and silver staining respectively. The LSECs and sub-endothelial basement membrane were observed with the scanning and transmission electronic microscope. The protein expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in liver were analyzed with Western blotting. Expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF) was investigated with immunofluorescence staining. The lipid peroxidation indicators including antisuperoxideanion (ASAFR), hydroxyl free radical (.OH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were determined with kits, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2/9) activities in liver were analyzed with gelatin zymography and in situ fluorescent zymography respectively. The model mice had much higher serum levels of ALT and AST than the normal mice. Compared to that in the normal control, more severe liver inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis, worse hepatic lipid peroxidation demonstrated by the increased ASAFR, .OH and MDA, but decreased SOD and GST, increased MMP-2/9 activities and VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and vWF expressions, which revealed obvious LSEC injury and scaffold structure broken, were shown in the model control. Compared with the model group, CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline significantly improved serum ALT/AST, attenuated hepatic inflammation and improved peroxidative injury in liver, decreased MMP-2/9 activities in liver tissue, improved integration of scaffold structure, and decreased protein expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. CMCS could protect LSECs from injury and maintain the microvasculature integration in acute injured liver of mice induced by LPS/D-GalN. Its action mechanism was associated with the down-regulation of MMP-2/9 activities and inhibition of peroxidation in injured liver.

24464220|t|Loss of Bak enhances lymphocytosis but does not ameliorate thrombocytopaenia in BCL-2 transgenic mice.
24464220|a|Bax and Bak are critical effectors of apoptosis. Although both are widely expressed and usually functionally redundant, recent studies suggest that Bak has particular importance in certain cell types. Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that Bak activation is prevented primarily by Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, whereas Bax is held in check by all pro-survival Bcl-2 homologues, including Bcl-2 itself. In this study, we have investigated whether loss of Bak or elevated Mcl-1 modulates haemopoietic abnormalities provoked by overexpression of Bcl-2. The Mcl-1 transgene had little impact, probably because the expression level was insufficient to effectively reduce Bak activation. However, loss of Bak enhanced lymphocytosis in vavP-BCL-2 transgenic mice and increased resistance of their thymocytes to some cytotoxic agents, implying that Bak-specific signals can be triggered in certain lymphoid populations. Nevertheless, lack of Bak had no significant impact on thymic abnormalities in vavP-BCL-2tg mice, which kinetic analysis suggested was due to accumulation of self-reactive thymocytes that resist deletion. Intriguingly, although Bak(-/-) mice have elevated platelet counts, Bak(-/-)vavP-BCL-2 mice, like vavP-BCL-2 littermates, were thrombocytopaenic. To clarify why, the vavP-BCL-2 platelet phenotype was scrutinised more closely. Platelet life span was found to be elevated in vavP-BCL-2 mice, which should have provoked thrombocytosis, as in Bak(-/-) mice. Analysis of bone marrow chimaeric mice suggested the low platelet phenotype was due principally to extrinsic factors. Following splenectomy, blood platelets remained lower in vavP-BCL-2 than wild-type mice. However, in Rag1(-/-) BCL-2tg mice, platelet levels were normal, implying that elevated lymphocytes are primarily responsible for BCL-2tg-induced thrombocytopaenia.

24477591|t|The -930A>G polymorphism of the CYBA gene is associated with premature coronary artery disease. A case-control study and gene-risk factors interactions.
24477591|a|Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). NADPH oxidases are the main source of ROS in the vasculature. p22phox is a critical component of vascular NADPH oxidases and is encoded by the CYBA (cytochrome b245 alpha) gene. The -930A>G CYBA polymorphism (rs9932581:A>G) modulates the activity of the CYBA promoter, and influences CYBA transcriptional activity. The aim of the present study was to analyze a possible association between the -930A>G polymorphism and CAD and to search for gene-traditional risk factors interactions. 480 subjects were studied: 240 patients with premature CAD, 240 age and sex matched blood donors. The -930A>G polymorphism was genotyped using the TaqMan - Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems). The -930G allele carrier state was a risk factor for CAD (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.21-3.44, P=0.007). A synergistic effect of the -930G allele with overweight/obesity (BMI --25) and cigarette smoking was found. The estimated CAD risk for BMI --25 and the -930G allele interaction was about 160% greater than that predicted by assuming additivity of the effects, and about 40% greater for interaction of cigarette smoking and the -930G allele. Overweight/obesity was a risk factor for CAD only in the -930G allele carriers (P<10(-10)) but not in the AA homozygotes (P=1.00). In conclusion the -930A>G CYBA polymorphism is associated with CAD in the Polish population. The -930G allele carriers are particularly at risk of consequences of obesity and tobacco smoke exposure.

24632946|t|Disruption of the temporally regulated cloaca endodermal b-catenin signaling causes anorectal malformations.
24632946|a|The cloaca is temporally formed and eventually divided by the urorectal septum (URS) during urogenital and anorectal organ development. Although congenital malformations, such as anorectal malformations (ARMs), are frequently observed during this process, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. b-Catenin is a critical component of canonical Wnt signaling and is essential for the regulation of cell differentiation and morphogenesis during embryogenesis. The expression of b-catenin is observed in endodermal epithelia, including URS epithelia. We modulated the b-catenin gene conditionally in endodermal epithelia by utilizing tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver line (Shh(CreERT2)). Both b-catenin loss- and gain-of-function (LOF and GOF) mutants displayed abnormal clefts in the perineal region and hypoplastic elongation of the URS. The mutants also displayed reduced cell proliferation in the URS mesenchyme. In addition, the b-catenin GOF mutants displayed reduced apoptosis and subsequently increased apoptosis in the URS epithelium. This instability possibly resulted in reduced expression levels of differentiation markers, such as keratin 1 and filaggrin, in the perineal epithelia. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) genes, such as Bmp4 and Bmp7, was also ectopically induced in the epithelia of the URS in the b-catenin GOF mutants. The expression of the Msx2 gene and phosphorylated-Smad1/5/8, possible readouts of Bmp signaling, was also increased in the mutants. Moreover, we introduced an additional mutation for a Bmp receptor gene: BmprIA. The Shh(CreERT2/+); b-catenin(flox(ex3)/+); BmprIA(flox/-) mutants displayed partial restoration of URS elongation compared with the b-catenin GOF mutants. These results indicate that some ARM phenotypes in the b-catenin GOF mutants were caused by abnormal Bmp signaling. The current analysis revealed the close relation of endodermal b-catenin signaling to the ARM phenotypes. These results are considered to shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of human ARMs.

24632949|t|Dysregulation of Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (Wif1) expression resulted in aberrant Wnt-b-catenin signaling and cell death of the cloaca endoderm, and anorectal malformations.
24632949|a|In mammalian urorectal development, the urorectal septum (urs) descends from the ventral body wall to the cloaca membrane (cm) to partition the cloaca into urogenital sinus and rectum. Defective urs growth results in human congenital anorectal malformations (ARMs), and their pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. Recent studies only focused on the importance of urs mesenchyme proliferation, which is induced by endoderm-derived Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). Here, we showed that the programmed cell death of the apical urs and proximal cm endoderm is particularly crucial for the growth of urs during septation. The apoptotic endoderm was closely associated with the tempo-spatial expression of Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (Wif1), which is an inhibitor of Wnt-b-catenin signaling. In Wif1(lacZ/lacZ) mutant mice and cultured urorectum with exogenous Wif1, cloaca septation was defective with undescended urs and hypospadias-like phenotypes, and such septation defects were also observed in Shh(-/-) mutants and in endodermal b-catenin gain-of-function (GOF) mutants. In addition, Wif1 and Shh were expressed in a complementary manner in the cloaca endoderm, and Wif1 was ectopically expressed in the urs and cm associated with excessive endodermal apoptosis and septation defects in Shh(-/-) mutants. Furthermore, apoptotic cells were markedly reduced in the endodermal b-catenin GOF mutant embryos, which counteracted the inhibitory effects of Wif1. Taken altogether, these data suggest that regulated expression of Wif1 is critical for the growth of the urs during cloaca septation. Hence, Wif1 governs cell apoptosis of urs endoderm by repressing b-catenin signal, which may facilitate the protrusion of the underlying proliferating mesenchymal cells towards the cm for cloaca septation. Dysregulation of this endodermal Shh-Wif1-b-catenin signaling axis contributes to ARM pathogenesis.

24768818|t|Structural mechanisms determining inhibition of the collagen receptor DDR1 by selective and multi-targeted type II kinase inhibitors.
24768818|a|The discoidin domain receptors (DDRs), DDR1 and DDR2, form a unique subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by the binding of triple-helical collagen. Excessive signaling by DDR1 and DDR2 has been linked to the progression of various human diseases, including fibrosis, atherosclerosis and cancer. We report the inhibition of these unusual receptor tyrosine kinases by the multi-targeted cancer drugs imatinib and ponatinib, as well as the selective type II inhibitor DDR1-IN-1. Ponatinib is identified as the more potent molecule, which inhibits DDR1 and DDR2 with an IC50 of 9nM. Co-crystal structures of human DDR1 reveal a DFG-out conformation (DFG, Asp-Phe-Gly) of the kinase domain that is stabilized by an unusual salt bridge between the activation loop and aD helix. Differences to Abelson kinase (ABL) are observed in the DDR1 P-loop, where a b-hairpin replaces the cage-like structure of ABL. P-loop residues in DDR1 that confer drug resistance in ABL are therefore accommodated outside the ATP pocket. Whereas imatinib and ponatinib bind potently to both the DDR and ABL kinases, the hydrophobic interactions of the ABL P-loop appear poorly satisfied by DDR1-IN-1 suggesting a structural basis for its DDR1 selectivity. Such inhibitors may have applications in clinical indications of DDR1 and DDR2 overexpression or mutation, including lung cancer.

24914936|t|Thyroid hormone receptor a mutation causes a severe and thyroxine-resistant skeletal dysplasia in female mice.
24914936|a|A new genetic disorder has been identified that results from mutation of THRA, encoding thyroid hormone receptor a1 (TRa1). Affected children have a high serum T3:T4 ratio and variable degrees of intellectual deficit and constipation but exhibit a consistently severe skeletal dysplasia. In an attempt to improve developmental delay and alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism, patients are receiving varying doses and durations of T4 treatment, but responses have been inconsistent so far. Thra1(PV/+) mice express a similar potent dominant-negative mutant TRa1 to affected individuals, and thus represent an excellent disease model. We hypothesized that Thra1(PV/+) mice could be used to predict the skeletal outcome of human THRA mutations and determine whether prolonged treatment with a supraphysiological dose of T4 ameliorates the skeletal abnormalities. Adult female Thra1(PV/+) mice had short stature, grossly abnormal bone morphology but normal bone strength despite high bone mass. Although T4 treatment suppressed TSH secretion, it had no effect on skeletal maturation, linear growth, or bone mineralization, thus demonstrating profound tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. Despite this, prolonged T4 treatment abnormally increased bone stiffness and strength, suggesting the potential for detrimental consequences in the long term. Our studies establish that TRa1 has an essential role in the developing and adult skeleton and predict that patients with different THRA mutations will display variable responses to T4 treatment, which depend on the severity of the causative mutation.

24971614|t|Functional characterization of obesity-associated variants involving the a and b isoforms of human SH2B1.
24971614|a|We have previously reported rare variants in sarcoma (Src) homology 2 (SH2) B adaptor protein 1 (SH2B1) in individuals with obesity, insulin resistance, and maladaptive behavior. Here, we identify 4 additional SH2B1 variants by sequencing 500 individuals with severe early-onset obesity. SH2B1 has 4 alternatively spliced isoforms. One variant (T546A) lies within the N-terminal region common to all isoforms. As shown for past variants in this region, T546A impairs SH2B1b enhancement of nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth, and the individual with the T546A variant exhibits mild developmental delay. The other 3 variants (A663V, V695M, and A723V) lie in the C-terminal tail of SH2B1a. SH2B1a variant carriers were hyperinsulinemic but did not exhibit the behavioral phenotype observed in individuals with SH2B1 variants that disrupt all isoforms. In in vitro assays, SH2B1a, like SH2B1b, enhances insulin- and leptin-induced insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) phosphorylation and GH-induced cell motility. None of the variants affect SH2B1a enhancement of insulin- and leptin-induced IRS2 phosphorylation. However, T546A, A663V, and A723V all impair the ability of SH2B1a to enhance GH-induced cell motility. In contrast to SH2B1b, SH2B1a does not enhance nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth. These studies suggest that genetic variants that disrupt isoforms other than SH2B1b may be functionally significant. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism by which the individual isoforms regulate energy homeostasis and behavior.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in MSC migration, differentiation, and immunomodulation. Recently, glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP) was shown to bind latency-associated peptide (LAP)/TGF-b1 to the cell surface of activated Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and megakaryocytes/platelets. In this manuscript, we show that human and mouse MSCs express GARP which presents LAP/TGF-b1 on their cell surface. Silencing GARP expression in MSCs increased their secretion and activation of TGF-b1 and reduced their proliferative capacity in a TGF-b1-independent manner. Importantly, we showed that GARP expression on MSCs contributed to their ability to inhibit T-cell responses in vitro. In summary, we have found that GARP is an essential molecule for MSC biology, regulating their immunomodulatory and proliferative activities. We envision GARP as a new target for improving the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs and also as a novel MSC marker.

25203209|t|Ena/VASP proteins cooperate with the WAVE complex to regulate the actin cytoskeleton.
25203209|a|Ena/VASP proteins and the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) regulate cell motility by virtue of their ability to independently promote actin polymerization. We demonstrate that Ena/VASP and the WRC control actin polymerization in a cooperative manner through the interaction of the Ena/VASP EVH1 domain with an extended proline rich motif in Abi. This interaction increases cell migration and enables VASP to cooperatively enhance WRC stimulation of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly in vitro in the presence of Rac. Loss of this interaction in Drosophila macrophages results in defects in lamellipodia formation, cell spreading, and redistribution of Ena to the tips of filopodia-like extensions. Rescue experiments of abi mutants also reveals a physiological requirement for the Abi:Ena interaction in photoreceptor axon targeting and oogenesis. Our data demonstrate that the activities of Ena/VASP and the WRC are intimately linked to ensure optimal control of actin polymerization during cell migration and development.

25279796|t|Impaired musculoskeletal response to age and exercise in PPARb(-/-) diabetic mice.
25279796|a|Fragility fractures are recognized complication of diabetes, but yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This is particularly pronounced in type 2 diabetes in which the propensity to fall is increased but bone mass is not necessarily low. Thus, whether factors implicated in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes directly impact on the musculoskeletal system remains to be investigated. PPARb(-/-) mice have reduced metabolic activity and are glucose intolerant. We examined changes in bone and muscle in PPARb(-/-) mice and investigated both the mechanism behind those changes with age as well as their response to exercise. Compared with their wild type, PPARb(-/-) mice had an accelerated and parallel decline in both muscle and bone strength with age. These changes were accompanied by increased myostatin expression, low bone formation, and increased resorption. In addition, mesenchymal cells from PPARb(-/-) had a reduced proliferation capacity and appeared to differentiate into more of an adipogenic phenotype. Concomitantly we observed an increased expression of PPARg, characteristic of adipocytes. The anabolic responses of muscle and bone to exercise were also diminished in PPARb(-/-) mice. The periosteal bone formation response to direct bone compression was, however, maintained, indicating that PPARb controls periosteal bone formation through muscle contraction and/or metabolism. Taken together, these data indicate that PPARb deficiency leads to glucose intolerance, decreased muscle function, and reduced bone strength. On a molecular level, PPARb appears to regulate myostatin and PPARg expression in muscle and bone, thereby providing potential new targets to reverse bone fragility in patients with metabolic disturbances.

25284079|t|Arabidopsis acyl-CoA-binding protein ACBP3 participates in plant response to hypoxia by modulating very-long-chain fatty acid metabolism.
25284079|a|In Arabidopsis thaliana, acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) are encoded by a family of six genes (ACBP1 to ACBP6), and are essential for diverse cellular activities. Recent investigations suggest that the membrane-anchored ACBPs are involved in oxygen sensing by sequestration of group VII ethylene-responsive factors under normoxia. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of Arabidopsis ACBP3 in hypoxic tolerance. ACBP3 transcription was remarkably induced following submergence under both dark (DS) and light (LS) conditions. ACBP3-overexpressors (ACBP3-OEs) showed hypersensitivity to DS, LS and ethanolic stresses, with reduced transcription of hypoxia-responsive genes as well as accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in the rosettes. In contrast, suppression of ACBP3 in ACBP3-KOs enhanced plant tolerance to DS, LS and ethanol treatments. By analyses of double combinations of OE-1 with npr1-5, coi1-2, ein3-1 as well as ctr1-1 mutants, we observed that the attenuated hypoxic tolerance in ACBP3-OEs was dependent on NPR1- and CTR1-mediated signaling pathways. Lipid profiling revealed that both the total amounts and very-long-chain species of phosphatidylserine (C42:2- and C42:3-PS) and glucosylinositolphosphorylceramides (C22:0-, C22:1-, C24:0-, C24:1-, and C26:1-GIPC) were significantly lower in ACBP3-OEs but increased in ACBP3-KOs upon LS exposure. By microscale thermophoresis analysis, the recombinant ACBP3 protein bound VLC acyl-CoA esters with high affinities in vitro. Further, a knockout mutant of MYB30, a master regulator of very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) biosynthesis, exhibited enhanced sensitivities to LS and ethanolic stresses, phenotypes that were ameliorated by ACBP3-RNAi. Taken together, these findings suggest that Arabidopsis ACBP3 participates in plant response to hypoxia by modulating VLCFA metabolism.

25307481|t|The Dpp/TGFb-dependent corepressor Schnurri protects epithelial cells from JNK-induced apoptosis in drosophila embryos.
25307481|a|Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) often mediates apoptosis in response to cellular stress. However, during normal development, JNK signaling controls a variety of live cell behaviors, such as during dorsal closure in Drosophila embryos. During this process, the latent proapoptotic activity of JNK becomes apparent following Dpp signaling suppression, which leads to JNK-dependent transcriptional activation of the proapoptotic gene reaper. Dpp signaling also protects cells from JNK-dependent apoptosis caused by epithelial disruption. We find that repression of reaper transcription by Dpp is mediated by Schnurri. Moreover, reporter gene analysis shows that a transcriptional regulatory module comprising AP-1 and Schnurri binding sites located upstream of reaper integrate the activities of JNK and Dpp. This arrangement allows JNK to control a migratory behavior without triggering apoptosis. Dpp plays a dual role during dorsal closure. It cooperates with JNK in stimulating cell migration and also prevents JNK from inducing apoptosis.

25546260|t|Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells directly contribute to arteriosclerotic progression via integrin b2.
25546260|a|Recent studies described the association between hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion in the bone marrow (BM), leukocytosis in the peripheral blood, and accelerated atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that circulating HSPC may home to inflamed vessels, where they might contribute to inflammation and neointima formation. We demonstrated that Lin(-) Sca-1(+) cKit(+) (LSK cells) in BM and peripheral blood of LDLr(-/-) mice on high fat diet expressed significantly more integrin b2 , which was responsible for LSK cell adhesion and migration toward ICAM-1 in vitro, and homing to injured arteries in vivo, all of which were blocked with an anti-CD18 blocking antibody. When homed LSK cells were isolated from ligated artery and injected to irradiated recipients, they resulted in BM reconstitution. Injection of CD18(+/+) LSK cells to immunodeficient Balb/C Rag2(-) gC(-/-) recipients resulted in more severe inflammation and reinforced neointima formation in the ligated carotid artery, compared to mice injected with PBS and CD18(-/-) LSK cells. Hypercholesterolemia stimulated ERK phosphorylation (pERK) in LSK cells of LDLr(-/-) mice in vivo. Blockade of pERK reduced ARF1 expression, leading to decreased integrin b2 function on HSPC. In addition, integrin b2 function could be regulated via ERK-independent LRP1 pathway. Integrin b2 expression on HSPC is regulated by hypercholesterolemia, specifically LDL, in pERK-dependent and -independent manners, leading to increased homing and localization of HSPC to injured arteries, which is highly correlated with arteriosclerosis.

25550469|t|The androgen receptor confers protection against diet-induced atherosclerosis, obesity, and dyslipidemia in female mice.
25550469|a|Androgens have important cardiometabolic actions in males, but their metabolic role in females is unclear. To determine the physiologic androgen receptor (AR)-dependent actions of androgens on atherogenesis in female mice, we generated female AR-knockout (ARKO) mice on an atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient background. After 8 weeks on a high-fat diet, but not on a normal chow diet, atherosclerosis in aorta was increased in ARKO females (+59% vs. control apoE-deficient mice with intact AR gene). They also displayed increased body weight (+18%), body fat percentage (+62%), and hepatic triglyceride levels, reduced insulin sensitivity, and a marked atherogenic dyslipidemia (serum cholesterol, +52%). Differences in atherosclerosis, body weight, and lipid levels between ARKO and control mice were abolished in mice that were ovariectomized before puberty, consistent with a protective action of ovarian androgens mediated via the AR. Furthermore, the AR agonist dihydrotestosterone reduced atherosclerosis (-41%; thoracic aorta), subcutaneous fat mass (-44%), and cholesterol levels (-35%) in ovariectomized mice, reduced hepatocyte lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells in vitro, and regulated mRNA expression of hepatic genes pivotal for lipid homeostasis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the AR protects against diet-induced atherosclerosis in female mice and propose that this is mediated by modulation of body composition and lipid metabolism.

25693948|t|Adipogenic Differentiation of hMSCs is Mediated by Recruitment of IGF-1r Onto the Primary Cilium Associated With Cilia Elongation.
25693948|a|Primary cilia are single non-motile organelles that provide a highly regulated compartment into which specific proteins are trafficked as a critical part of various signaling pathways. The absence of primary cilia has been shown to prevent differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Changes in primary cilia length are crucial for regulating signaling events; however it is not known how alterations in cilia structure relate to differentiation. This study tested the hypothesis that changes in primary cilia structure are required for stem cell differentiation. hMSCs expressed primary cilia that were labeled with acetylated alpha tubulin and visualized by confocal microscopy. Chemically induced differentiation resulted in lineage specific changes in cilia length and prevalence which were independent of cell cycle. In particular, adipogenic differentiation resulted in cilia elongation associated with the presence of dexamethasone, while insulin had an inhibitory effect on cilia length. Over a 7-day time course, adipogenic differentiation media resulted in cilia elongation within 2 days followed by increased nuclear PPARg levels; an early marker of adipogenesis. Cilia elongation was associated with increased trafficking of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor b (IGF-1Rb) into the cilium. This was reversed on inhibition of elongation by IFT-88 siRNA transfection, which also decreased nuclear PPARg. This is the first study to show that adipogenic differentiation requires primary cilia elongation associated with the recruitment of IGF-1Rb onto the cilium. This study may lead to the development of cilia-targeted therapies for controlling adipogenic differentiation and associated conditions such as obesity.

25698444|t|The CB -cannabinoid receptor signals striatal neuroprotection via a PI3K/Akt/mTORC1/BDNF pathway.
25698444|a|The CB1 cannabinoid receptor, the main molecular target of endocannabinoids and cannabis active components, is the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor in the mammalian brain. In particular, the CB1 receptor is highly expressed in the basal ganglia, mostly on terminals of medium-sized spiny neurons, where it plays a key neuromodulatory function. The CB1 receptor also confers neuroprotection in various experimental models of striatal damage. However, the assessment of the physiological relevance and therapeutic potential of the CB1 receptor in basal ganglia-related diseases is hampered, at least in part, by the lack of knowledge of the precise mechanism of CB1 receptor neuroprotective activity. Here, by using an array of pharmacological, genetic and pharmacogenetic (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) approaches, we show that (1) CB1 receptor engagement protects striatal cells from excitotoxic death via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway, which, in turn, (2) induces brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression through the selective activation of BDNF gene promoter IV, an effect that is mediated by multiple transcription factors. To assess the possible functional impact of the CB1/BDNF axis in a neurodegenerative-disease context in vivo, we conducted experiments in the R6/2 mouse, a well-established model of Huntington's disease, in which the CB1 receptor and BDNF are known to be severely downregulated in the dorsolateral striatum. Adeno-associated viral vector-enforced re-expression of the CB1 receptor in the dorsolateral striatum of R6/2 mice allowed the re-expression of BDNF and the concerted rescue of the neuropathological deficits in these animals. Collectively, these findings unravel a molecular link between CB1 receptor activation and BDNF expression, and support the relevance of the CB1/BDNF axis in promoting striatal neuron survival.

25732851|t|Adipose triglyceride lipase is involved in the mobilization of triglyceride and retinoid stores of hepatic stellate cells.
25732851|a|Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) store triglycerides (TGs) and retinyl ester (RE) in cytosolic lipid droplets. RE stores are degraded following retinoid starvation or in response to pathogenic stimuli resulting in HSC activation. At present, the major enzymes catalyzing lipid degradation in HSCs are unknown. In this study, we investigated whether adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is involved in RE catabolism of HSCs. Additionally, we compared the effects of ATGL deficiency and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) deficiency, a known RE hydrolase (REH), on RE stores in liver and adipose tissue. We show that ATGL degrades RE even in the presence of TGs, implicating that these substrates compete for ATGL binding. REH activity was stimulated and inhibited by comparative gene identification-58 and G0/G1 switch gene-2, respectively, the physiological regulators of ATGL activity. In cultured primary murine HSCs, pharmacological inhibition of ATGL, but not HSL, increased RE accumulation. In mice globally lacking ATGL or HSL, RE contents in white adipose tissue were decreased or increased, respectively, while plasma retinol and liver RE levels remained unchanged. In conclusion, our study shows that ATGL acts as REH in HSCs promoting the degradation of RE stores in addition to its established function as TG lipase. HSL is the predominant REH in adipocytes but does not affect lipid mobilization in HSCs.

25818835|t|An in vivo screen to identify candidate neurogenic genes in the developing Xenopus visual system.
25818835|a|Neurogenesis in the brain of Xenopus laevis continues throughout larval stages of development. We developed a 2-tier screen to identify candidate genes controlling neurogenesis in Xenopus optic tectum in vivo. First, microarray and NanoString analyses were used to identify candidate genes that were differentially expressed in Sox2-expressing neural progenitor cells or their neuronal progeny. Then an in vivo, time-lapse imaging-based screen was used to test whether morpholinos against 34 candidate genes altered neural progenitor cell proliferation or neuronal differentiation over 3 days in the optic tectum of intact Xenopus tadpoles. We co-electroporated antisense morpholino oligonucleotides against each of the candidate genes with a plasmid that drives GFP expression in Sox2-expressing neural progenitor cells and quantified the effects of morpholinos on neurogenesis. Of the 34 morpholinos tested, 24 altered neural progenitor cell proliferation or neuronal differentiation. The candidates which were tagged as differentially expressed and validated by the in vivo imaging screen include: actn1, arl9, eif3a, elk4, ephb1, fmr1-a, fxr1-1, fbxw7, fgf2, gstp1, hat1, hspa5, lsm6, mecp2, mmp9, and prkaca. Several of these candidates, including fgf2 and elk4, have known or proposed neurogenic functions, thereby validating our strategy to identify candidates. Genes with no previously demonstrated neurogenic functions, gstp1, hspa5 and lsm6, were identified from the morpholino experiments, suggesting that our screen successfully revealed unknown candidates. Genes that are associated with human disease, such as such as mecp2 and fmr1-a, were identified by our screen, providing the groundwork for using Xenopus as an experimental system to probe conserved disease mechanisms. Together the data identify candidate neurogenic regulatory genes and demonstrate that Xenopus is an effective experimental animal to identify and characterize genes that regulate neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in vivo.

25882048|t|Idh1 protects murine hepatocytes from endotoxin-induced oxidative stress by regulating the intracellular NADP(+)/NADPH ratio.
25882048|a|Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (Idh1) is an important metabolic enzyme that produces NADPH by converting isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate. Idh1 is known to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced in cells by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. Here, we used Idh1-deficient knockout (Idh1 KO) mice to investigate the role of Idh1 in antioxidant defense in vivo. Idh1 KO mice showed heightened susceptibility to death induced by LPS and exhibited increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6. The serum of LPS-injected Idh1 KO mice also contained elevated levels of AST, a marker of inflammatory liver damage. Furthermore, after LPS injection, livers of Idh1 KO mice showed histological evidence of elevated oxidative DNA damage compared with livers of wild-type (WT) mice. Idh1 KO livers showed a faster and more pronounced oxidative stress than WT livers. In line with that, Idh1 KO hepatocytes showed higher ROS levels and an increase in the NADP(+)/NADPH ratio when compared with hepatocytes isolated from WT mice. These results suggest that Idh1 has a physiological function in protecting cells from oxidative stress by regulating the intracellular NADP(+)/NADPH ratio. Our findings suggest that stimulation of Idh1 activity may be an effective therapeutic strategy for reducing oxidative stress during inflammatory responses, including the early stages of septic shock.

25983002|t|Inhibition of LDHA suppresses tumor progression in prostate cancer.
25983002|a|A key hallmark of cancer cells is their altered metabolism, known as Warburg effect. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) executes the final step of aerobic glycolysis and has been reported to be involved in the tumor progression. However, the function of LDHA in prostate cancer has not been studied. In current study, we observed overexpression of LDHA in the clinical prostate cancer samples compared with benign prostate hyperplasia tissues as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and real-time qPCR. Attenuated expression of LDHA by siRNA or inhibition of LDHA activities by FX11 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis of PC-3 and DU145 cells. Mechanistically, decreased Warburg effect as demonstrated by reduced glucose consumption and lactate secretion and reduced expression of MMP-9, PLAU, and cathepsin B were found after LDHA knockdown or FX11 treatment in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Taken together, our study revealed the oncogenic role of LDHA in prostate cancer and suggested that LDHA might be a potential therapeutic target.

26017929|t|Leptin activation of mTOR pathway in intestinal epithelial cell triggers lipid droplet formation, cytokine production and increased cell proliferation.
26017929|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that obesity and enhanced inflammatory reactions are predisposing conditions for developing colon cancer. Obesity is associated with high levels of circulating leptin. Leptin is an adipocytokine that is secreted by adipose tissue and modulates immune response and inflammation. Lipid droplets (LD) are organelles involved in lipid metabolism and production of inflammatory mediators, and increased numbers of LD were observed in human colon cancer. Leptin induces the formation of LD in macrophages in a PI3K/mTOR pathway-dependent manner. Moreover, the mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in cellular growth and is frequently altered in tumors. We therefore investigated the role of leptin in the modulation of mTOR pathway and regulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory phenotype in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6 cells). We show that leptin promotes a dose- and time-dependent enhancement of LD formation. The biogenesis of LD was accompanied by enhanced CXCL1/CINC-1, CCL2/MCP-1 and TGF-b production and increased COX-2 expression in these cells. We demonstrated that leptin-induced increased phosphorylation of STAT3 and AKT and a dose and time-dependent mTORC activation with enhanced phosphorilation of the downstream protein P70S6K protein. Pre-treatment with rapamycin significantly inhibited leptin effects in LD formation, COX-2 and TGF-b production in IEC-6 cells. Moreover, leptin was able to stimulate the proliferation of epithelial cells on a mTOR-dependent manner. We conclude that leptin regulates lipid metabolism, cytokine production and proliferation of intestinal cells through a mechanism largely dependent on activation of the mTOR pathway, thus suggesting that leptin-induced mTOR activation may contribute to the obesity-related enhanced susceptibility to colon carcinoma.

26102294|t|Role of stress-activated OCT4A in the cell fate decisions of embryonal carcinoma cells treated with etoposide.
26102294|a|Tumor cellular senescence induced by genotoxic treatments has recently been found to be paradoxically linked to the induction of "stemness." This observation is critical as it directly impinges upon the response of tumors to current chemo-radio-therapy treatment regimens. Previously, we showed that following etoposide (ETO) treatment embryonal carcinoma PA-1 cells undergo a p53-dependent upregulation of OCT4A and p21Cip1 (governing self-renewal and regulating cell cycle inhibition and senescence, respectively). Here we report further detail on the relationship between these and other critical cell-fate regulators. PA-1 cells treated with ETO display highly heterogeneous increases in OCT4A and p21Cip1 indicative of dis-adaptation catastrophe. Silencing OCT4A suppresses p21Cip1, changes cell cycle regulation and subsequently suppresses terminal senescence; p21Cip1-silencing did not affect OCT4A expression or cellular phenotype. SOX2 and NANOG expression did not change following ETO treatment suggesting a dissociation of OCT4A from its pluripotency function. Instead, ETO-induced OCT4A was concomitant with activation of AMPK, a key component of metabolic stress and autophagy regulation. p16ink4a, the inducer of terminal senescence, underwent autophagic sequestration in the cytoplasm of ETO-treated cells, allowing alternative cell fates. Accordingly, failure of autophagy was accompanied by an accumulation of p16ink4a, nuclear disintegration, and loss of cell recovery. Together, these findings imply that OCT4A induction following DNA damage in PA-1 cells, performs a cell stress, rather than self-renewal, function by moderating the expression of p21Cip1, which alongside AMPK helps to then regulate autophagy. Moreover, this data indicates that exhaustion of autophagy, through persistent DNA damage, is the cause of terminal cellular senescence.

26411452|t|Putative Prostate Cancer Risk SNP in an Androgen Receptor-Binding Site of the Melanophilin Gene Illustrates Enrichment of Risk SNPs in Androgen Receptor Target Sites.
26411452|a|Genome-wide association studies have identified genomic loci, whose single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predispose to prostate cancer (PCa). However, the mechanisms of most of these variants are largely unknown. We integrated chromatin-immunoprecipitation-coupled sequencing and microarray expression profiling in TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement positive DUCaP cells with the GWAS PCa risk SNPs catalog to identify disease susceptibility SNPs localized within functional androgen receptor-binding sites (ARBSs). Among the 48 GWAS index risk SNPs and 3,917 linked SNPs, 80 were found located in ARBSs. Of these, rs11891426:T>G in an intron of the melanophilin gene (MLPH) was within a novel putative auxiliary AR-binding motif, which is enriched in the neighborhood of canonical androgen-responsive elements. T>G exchange attenuated the transcriptional activity of the ARBS in an AR reporter gene assay. The expression of MLPH in primary prostate tumors was significantly lower in those with the G compared with the T allele and correlated significantly with AR protein. Higher melanophilin level in prostate tissue of patients with a favorable PCa risk profile points out a tumor-suppressive effect. These results unravel a hidden link between AR and a functional putative PCa risk SNP, whose allele alteration affects androgen regulation of its host gene MLPH.

26450454|t|Conditional knockdown of BCL2A1 reveals rate-limiting roles in BCR-dependent B-cell survival.
26450454|a|Bcl2 family proteins control mitochondrial apoptosis and its members exert critical cell type and differentiation stage-specific functions, acting as barriers against autoimmunity or transformation. Anti-apoptotic Bcl2a1/Bfl1/A1 is frequently deregulated in different types of blood cancers in humans but its physiological role is poorly understood as quadruplication of the Bcl2a1 gene locus in mice hampers conventional gene targeting strategies. Transgenic overexpression of A1, deletion of the A1-a paralogue or constitutive knockdown in the hematopoietic compartment of mice by RNAi suggested rate-limiting roles in lymphocyte development, granulopoiesis and mast cell activation. Here we report on the consequences of conditional knockdown of A1 protein expression using a reverse transactivator (rtTA)-driven approach that highlights a critical role for this Bcl2 family member in the maintenance of mature B-cell homeostasis. Furthermore, we define the A1/Bim (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death) axis as a target of key kinases mediating B-cell receptor (BCR)-dependent survival signals, such as, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Brutons tyrosine kinase (Btk). As such, A1 represents a putative target for the treatment of B-cell-related pathologies depending on hyperactivation of BCR-emanating survival signals and loss of A1 expression accounts, in part, for the pro-apoptotic effects of Syk- or Btk inhibitors that rely on the 'BH3-only' protein Bim for cell killing.

26462740|t|Diagnostic Exome Sequencing Identifies a Novel Gene, EMILIN1, Associated with Autosomal-Dominant Hereditary Connective Tissue Disease.
26462740|a|Heritable connective tissue diseases are a highly heterogeneous family of over 200 disorders that affect the extracellular matrix. While the genetic basis of several disorders is established, the etiology has not been discovered for a large portion of patients, likely due to rare yet undiscovered disease genes. By performing trio-exome sequencing of a 55-year-old male proband presenting with multiple symptoms indicative of a connective disorder, we identified a heterozygous missense alteration in exon 1 of the Elastin Microfibril Interfacer 1 (EMILIN1) gene, c.64G>A (p.A22T). The proband presented with ascending and descending aortic aneurysms, bilateral lower leg and foot sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, arthropathy, and increased skin elasticity. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the EMILIN1 alteration, which maps around the signal peptide cleavage site, segregated with disease in the affected proband, mother, and son. The impaired secretion of EMILIN-1 in cells transfected with the mutant p.A22T coincided with abnormal protein accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum. In skin biopsy of the proband, we detected less EMILIN-1 with disorganized and abnormal coarse fibrils, aggregated deposits underneath the epidermis basal lamina, and dermal cells apoptosis. These findings collectively suggest that EMILIN1 may represent a new disease gene associated with an autosomal-dominant connective tissue disorder.

26470726|t|Apoptosis of Sertoli cells after conditional ablation of murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) gene is p53-dependent and results in male sterility.
26470726|a|Beside its well-documented role in carcinogenesis, the function of p53 family has been more recently revealed in development and female reproduction, but it is still poorly documented in male reproduction. We specifically tested this possibility by ablating Mdm2, an E3 ligase that regulates p53 protein stability and transactivation function, specifically in Sertoli cells (SCs) using the AMH-Cre line and created the new SC-Mdm2(-/-) line. Heterozygous SC-Mdm2(-/+) adult males were fertile, but SC-Mdm2(-/-) males were infertile and exhibited: a shorter ano-genital distance, an extra duct along the vas deferens that presents a uterus-like morphology, degenerated testes with no organized seminiferous tubules and a complete loss of differentiated germ cells. In adults, testosterone levels as well as StAR, P450c17 (Cyp17a1) and P450scc (Cyp11a1) mRNA levels decreased significantly, and both plasma LH and FSH levels increased. A detailed investigation of testicular development indicated that the phenotype arose during fetal life, with SC-Mdm2(-/-) testes being much smaller at birth. Interestingly, Leydig cells remained present until adulthood and fetal germ cells abnormally initiated meiosis. Inactivation of Mdm2 in SCs triggered p53 activation and apoptosis as early as 15.5 days post conception with significant increase in apoptotic SCs. Importantly, testis development occurred normally in SC-Mdm2(-/-) lacking p53 mice (SC-Mdm2(-/-)p53(-/-)) and accordingly, these mice were fertile indicating that the aforementioned phenotypes are entirely p53-dependent. These data not only highlight the importance of keeping p53 in check for proper testicular development and male fertility but also certify the critical role of SCs in the maintenance of meiotic repression.

26561546|t|Synovial Regulatory T Cells Occupy a Discrete TCR Niche in Human Arthritis and Require Local Signals To Stabilize FOXP3 Protein Expression.
26561546|a|Although there is great interest in harnessing the immunosuppressive potential of FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) for treating autoimmunity, a sizeable knowledge gap exists regarding Treg fate in human disease. In juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients, we have previously reported that atypical CD25(+)FOXP3(-) Treg-like cells uniquely populate the inflamed site. Intriguingly, their proportions relative to CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Tregs associate with arthritis course, suggesting a role in disease. The ontogeny of these FOXP3(-) Treg-like cells is, however, unknown. In this study, we interrogated clonal relationships between CD4(+) T cell subsets in JIA, using high-throughput TCR repertoire analysis. We reveal that FOXP3(+) Tregs possess highly exclusive TCRb usage from conventional T cells, in blood, and also at the inflamed site, where they are clonally expanded. Intriguingly, the repertoires of FOXP3(+) Tregs in synovial fluid are highly overlapping with CD25(+)FOXP3(-) Treg-like cells, indicating fluctuations in FOXP3 expression in the inflamed joint. Furthermore, cultured synovial Tregs rapidly downregulated FOXP3 protein (but not mRNA), and this process was prevented by addition of synovial fluid from JIA patients, through an IL-6-independent mechanism. Our findings suggest that most Tregs arise from a separate lineage from conventional T cells, and that this repertoire divergence is largely maintained under chronic inflammatory conditions. We propose that subsequent Treg expansions at the inflamed site creates an environment that leads to competition for limited resources within the synovium, resulting in the destabilization of FOXP3 expression in some Tregs.

26615423|t|Upregulation of centrosomal protein 55 is associated with unfavorable prognosis and tumor invasion in epithelial ovarian carcinoma.
26615423|a|Centrosomal protein 55 (CEP55) is a cell cycle regulator implicated in development of certain cancers. However, characteristics of CEP55 expression and its clinical/prognostic significance are unclear in human epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Therefore, we investigated the expression and clinicopathological significance of CEP55 in patients with EOC and its role in regulating invasion and metastasis of ovarian cell lines. CEP55 mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Potential associations of CEP55 expression scores with clinical parameters and patient survival were evaluated. CEP55 function was investigated further using RNA interference, wound healing assay, transwell assay, immunofluorescence analysis, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. CEP55 was significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer cell lines and lesions compared with normal cells and adjacent noncancerous ovarian tissues. In the 213 EOC samples, CEP55 protein levels were positively correlated with clinical stage (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), intraperitoneal metastasis (P < 0.001), tumor recurrence (P < 0.001), differentiation grade (P < 0.001), residual tumor size (P < 0.001), ascites see tumor cells (P = 0.020), and serum CA153 level (P < 0.001). Moreover, patients with aberrant CEP55 protein expression showed tendencies to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.001) and cytoreductive surgery (P = 0.020). By contrast, no significant correlation was detected between the protein levels and patient age, histological type, or serum CA125, CA199, CA724, NSE, CEA, and b-HCG levels. Patients with high CEP55 protein expression had shorter overall survival and disease-free survival compared with those with low CEP55 expression. Multivariate analysis implicated CEP55 as an independent prognostic indicator for EOC patients. Additionally, downregulation of CEP55 in ovarian cancer cells remarkably inhibited cellular motility and invasion. Aberrant CEP55 expression may predict unfavorable clinical outcomes in EOC patients and play an important role in regulating invasion in ovarian cancer cells. Thus, CEP55 may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for EOC.

26782073|t|Effect of junctional adhesion molecule-2 expression on cell growth, invasion and migration in human colorectal cancer.
26782073|a|The junctional adhesion molecule (JAMs) family belongs to the immunoglobulin subfamily involved in the formation of tight junctions (TJ) in both endothelial and epithelial cells. Aberrant expression of JAM-2 is associated with cancer progression but little work has been carried out in discovering how this affects changes in cell behaviour. The present study aimed to examine the expression of JAM-2 in human colon cancer specimens and cell lines and its role in the development of colon cancer. JAM-2 expression in human colon cancer specimens (normal, n=75; cancer, n=94) and cell lines was analysed using quantitative real-time PCR and conventional RT-PCR. Colon cancer cells were stably transfected with a mammalian expression vector to overexpress JAM-2-Flag. The effect on growth, adhesion and migration following overexpression of JAM-2 was then investigated using in vitro models. TJ function was assessed using a trans-epithelial resistance assay (TER, with an EVOM voltammeter). JAM-2 was lowly expressed in colon cancer cells such as RKO, HT115. JAM-2 overexpression in RKO cells (RKO-JAM-2) and HT115 cells (HT115-JAM-2) showed retarded adhesion (P<0.05). An in vivo tumour model showed that RKO-JAM-2 had significantly reduced growth (P<0.05), invasion (P<0.05) and migration (P<0.05) as well as in HT115-JAM-2, except on proliferation and migration. Expression of JAM-2 resulted in a significant increase in TER and decrease in permeability of polarized monolayers (P<0.05). Further analysis of JAM-2 transcript levels against clinical aspects demonstrated that the decreasing JAM-2 expression correlated to disease progression, metastasis and poor survival. Taken together, JAM-2 may function as a putative tumour suppressor in the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer.

26782292|t|Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein-3 as a marker for distinguishing between cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and keratoacanthoma.
26782292|a|In the histopathological diagnosis of cutaneous tumors, the differential diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with crateriform architecture and keratoacanthoma (KA) is often difficult so an accurate understanding of the biological features and the identification of reliable markers of SCC and KA are crucial issues. Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein-3 (IGF2BP3, also known as IMP3) is thought of as a bona fide oncofetal protein, which is overexpressed and is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in several kinds of tumors. However, the role of IMP3 in cutaneous SCC and KA has not been well studied. Therefore, we focused on studying the biological functions of IMP3 in SCC and KA. In human skin SCC cell lines, HSC-1 and HSC-5, and the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, IMP3 mRNA levels were significantly higher than that of normal human skin. The knockdown of IMP3 expression reduced the proliferation of HSC-1, and significantly reduced invasion by HSC-1 and HSC-5. In contrast, the knockdown of IMP3 did not significantly affect invasion by HaCaT cells. In immunohistochemical studies of SCC and KA tissues, the Ki-67 labeling index (LI) of the suprabasal cell layer was significantly higher in SCC, compared with KA tissues and the tumor-free margin (TFM) adjacent to SCC and KA. Most SCC tissues stained strongly positive for IMP3, but KA tissues and TFM were mostly negative for IMP3. The Ki-67 LI of the IMP3-positive group was significantly higher than that of the IMP3-negative group in the suprabasal cell layer of SCC. These results suggest that IMP3 plays an important role in proliferation and, more significantly, in the invasion of SCC, and may be a suitable marker for the histopathological diagnosis of SCC with a crateriform architecture and KA. Furthermore, IMP3 may potentially be a new therapeutic target for SCC.

26783151|t|Identification of haptoglobin peptide as a novel serum biomarker for lung squamous cell carcinoma by serum proteome and peptidome profiling.
26783151|a|To date, a number of potential biomarkers for lung squamous cell cancer (SCC) have been identified; however, sensitive biomarkers are currently lacking to detect early stage SCC due to low sensitivity and specificity. In the present study, we compared the 7 serum proteomic profiles of 11 SCC patients, 7 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and 7 healthy smokers as controls to identify potential serum biomarkers associated with SCC and COPD. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass-spectrometric analysis (MS) using an affinity column revealed two candidate proteins, haptoglobin (HP) and apolipoprotein 4, as biomarkers of SCC, and a-1-antichymotrypsin as a marker of COPD. The iTRAQ technique was also used to identify SCC-specific peptides. HP protein expression was significantly higher in SCC patients than in COPD patients. Furthermore, two HP protein peptides showed significantly higher serum levels in SCC patients than in COPD patients. We established novel polyclonal antibodies for the two HP peptides and subsequently a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantification of these specific peptides in patient and control sera. The sensitivity of detection by ELISA of one HP peptide (HP216) was 70% of SCC patients, 40% of COPDs patients and 13% of healthy controls. We also measured CYFRA, a cytokeratin fragment clinically used as an SCC tumor marker, in all the 28 cases and found CYFRA was detected in only seven SCC cases. However, when the measurement of HP216 was combined with that of CYFRA, 100% (10 of 10 patients) of SCC cases were detected. Our proteomic profiling demonstrates that the SCC-specific HP peptide HP216 may potentially be used as a diagnostic biomarker for SCC.

26820130|t|Long non-coding RNA AK027294 involves in the process of proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells.
26820130|a|This study is aimed to investigate the differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in colorectal cancer and its potential biological function. Colorectal adenoma is the precancerous lesions of colorectal cancer, so in this study, we used colorectal adenoma as negative control. The global lncRNA expression profile in colorectal cancer and adenoma was evaluated by bioinformatics. The biological functions and potential mechanism of AK027294 were investigated in HCT116, HCT8, and SW480 colorectal cancer cells. A total of 135 lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in colorectal cancer and adenoma tissues. Among them, 71 lncRNAs were up-regulated and 64 lncRNAs were down-regulated. Especially, AK027294 was found to be highly expressed in colorectal cancer tissues compared with colorectal adenoma tissues (fold change is 184.5). Our results indicated that AK027294 down-regulation significantly inhibited colorectal cancer cells proliferation and migration, but promoted cell apoptosis (P < 0.05). The potential mechanism of AK027294 might be associated with the regulation of caspase-3, caspase-8, Bcl-2, MMP12, MMP9, and TWIST. The lncRNA expression profile in colorectal cancer suggests lncRNAs may play important roles in the occurrence and progression of colorectal cancer. AK027294 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer and closely correlates with colorectal cells proliferation, migration, and apoptosis.

26831905|t|Identification of the dopamine transporter SLC6A3 as a biomarker for patients with renal cell carcinoma.
26831905|a|BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is among the most common human malignancies. METHODS: In order to provide better understanding of the molecular biology of ccRCC and to identify potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarker and therapeutic targets, we utilized a microarray to profile mRNA expression of corresponding normal and malignant renal tissues. Real-time PCR, Western Blot and immunohistochemistry were applied to study the expression of candidate biomarkers. ccRCC cell lines were treated with sertraline to inhibit the dopamine transporter SLC6A3. RESULTS: Differential expression of fourteen mRNAs, yet not studied in ccRCC in depth, was confirmed using qPCR (upregulation: SLC6A3, NPTX2, TNFAIP6, NDUFA4L2, ENPP3, FABP6, SPINK13; downregulation: FXYD4, SLC12A1, KNG1, NPHS2, SLC13A3, GCGR, PLG). Up-/downregulation was also confirmed for FXYD4, KNG1, NPTX2 and SLC12A1 by Western Blot on the protein level. In contrast to the mRNA expression, protein expression of the dopamine transporter SLC6A3 was lower in ccRCC compared to normal renal tissue. Immunohistochemistry indicated that this decrease was due to higher concentrations of SLC6A3 in the proximal tubules. Immunohistochemical analyses further demonstrated that high SLC6A3 expression in ccRCC tissue was correlated with a shorter period of recurrence-free survival following surgery. Treatment of ccRCC cells with the SLC6A3 inhibitor sertraline induced dose-dependent cell-death. CONCLUSION: Our study identified several novel biomarkers with diagnostic potential and further investigations on sertraline as therapeutic agent in ccRCC patients are warranted.

26890356|t|Repression of Wnt/b-catenin response elements by p63 (TP63).
26890356|a|Submitted: TP63 (p63), a member of the tumor suppressor TP53 (p53) gene family, is expressed in keratinocyte stem cells and well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas to maintain cellular potential for growth and differentiation. Controversially, activation of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling by p63 (Patturajan M. et al., 2002, Cancer Cells) and inhibition of the target gene expression (Drewelus I. et al., 2010, Cell Cycle) have been reported. Upon p63 RNA-silencing in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines, a few Wnt target gene expression substantially increased, while several target genes moderately decreased. Although DNp63a, the most abundant isoform of p63, appeared to interact with protein phosphatase PP2A, neither GSK-3b phosphorylation nor b-catenin nuclear localization was altered by the loss of p63. As reported earlier, DNp63a enhanced b-catenin-dependent luc gene expression from pGL3-OT having 3 artificial Wnt response elements (WREs). However, this activation was detectable only in HEK293 cells examined so far, and involved a p53 family-related sequence 5' to the WREs. In Wnt3-expressing SAOS-2 cells, DNp63a rather strongly inhibited transcription of pGL3-OT. Importantly, DNp63a repressed WREs isolated from the regulatory regions of MMP7. DNp63a-TCF4 association occurred in their soluble forms in the nucleus. Furthermore, p63 and TCF4 coexisted at a WRE of MMP7 on the chromatin, where b-catenin recruitment was attenuated. The combined results indicate that DNp63a serves as a repressor that regulates b-catenin-mediated gene expression.

26900322|t|CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms associated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.
26900322|a|PURPOSE: Complement factor I (CFI) plays an important role in complement activation pathways and is known to affect the development of uveitis. The present study was performed to investigate the existence of an association between CFI genetic polymorphisms and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome. METHODS: A total of 100 patients diagnosed with VKH syndrome and 300 healthy controls were recruited for the study. Two milliliters of peripheral blood were collected in a sterile anticoagulative tube. CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY technology. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using a X(2) test. The analyses were stratified for recurrent status, complicated cataract status, and steroid-sensitive status. RESULTS: No significant association was found between CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms and VKH syndrome. However, patients with recurrent VKH syndrome had lower frequencies of the G allele and GG homozygosity in CFI-rs7356506 when compared to the controls (p=0.016, odds ratio [OR]=0.429, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.212-0.871; p=0.014, OR=0.364, 95% CI=0.158-0.837, respectively). Furthermore, there were significant decreases in the frequencies of the G allele and GG homozygosity in CFI-rs7356506 in patients with VKH syndrome with complicated cataract compared to the controls (p<0.001, OR=0.357, 95% CI=0.197-0.648; p<0.001, OR=0.273, 95% CI=0.135-0.551, respectively). Nevertheless, no significant association with patients with VKH syndrome in steroid-sensitive statuses was detected for CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CFI polymorphisms are not significantly associated with VKH syndrome; nevertheless, we identified a trend for the association of CFI-7356506 with VKH syndrome that depends on the recurrent status and the complicated cataract status but not on the steroid-sensitive status.

26919204|t|Cdc45 is limiting for replication initiation in humans.
26919204|a|Cdc45 is an essential protein that together with Mcm2-7 and GINS forms the eukaryotic replicative helicase CMG. Cdc45 seems to be rate limiting for the initial unwinding or firing of replication origins. In line with this view, Cdc45-overexpressing cells fired at least twice as many origins as control cells. However, these cells displayed an about 2-fold diminished fork elongation rate, a pronounced asymmetry of replication fork extension, and an early S phase arrest. This was accompanied by H2AX-phosphorylation and subsequent apoptosis. Unexpectedly, we did not observe increased ATR/Chk1 signaling but rather a mild ATM/Chk2 response. In addition, we detected accumulation of long stretches of single-stranded DNA, a hallmark of replication catastrophe. We conclude that increased origin firing by upregulated Cdc45 caused exhaustion of the single-strand binding protein RPA, which in consequence diminished the ATR/Chk1 response; the subsequently occurring fork breaks led to an ATM/Chk2 mediated phosphorylation of H2AX and eventually to apoptosis.

26950201|t|Multiple Transduction Pathways Mediate Thyrotropin Receptor Signaling in Preosteoblast-Like Cells.
26950201|a|It has been shown that the TSH receptor (TSHR) couples to a number of different signaling pathways, although the Gs-cAMP pathway has been considered primary. Here, we measured the effects of TSH on bone marker mRNA and protein expression in preosteoblast-like U2OS cells stably expressing TSHRs. We determined which signaling cascades are involved in the regulation of IL-11, osteopontin (OPN), and alkaline phosphatase (ALPL). We demonstrated that TSH-induced up-regulation of IL-11 is primarily mediated via the Gs pathway as IL-11 was up-regulated by forskolin (FSK), an adenylyl cyclase activator, and inhibited by protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 and by silencing of Gas by small interfering RNA. OPN levels were not affected by FSK, but its up-regulation was inhibited by TSHR/Gi-uncoupling by pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin decreased p38 MAPK kinase phosphorylation, and a p38 inhibitor and small interfering RNA knockdown of p38a inhibited OPN induction by TSH. Up-regulation of ALPL expression required high doses of TSH (EC50 = 395nM), whereas low doses (EC50 = 19nM) were inhibitory. FSK-stimulated cAMP production decreased basal ALPL expression, whereas protein kinase A inhibition by H-89 and silencing of Gas increased basal levels of ALPL. Knockdown of Gaq/11 and a protein kinase C inhibitor decreased TSH-stimulated up-regulation of ALPL, whereas a protein kinase C activator increased ALPL levels. A MAPK inhibitor and silencing of ERK1/2 inhibited TSH-stimulated ALPL expression. We conclude that TSH regulates expression of different bone markers via distinct signaling pathways.

26963473|t|A Role for Androgens in Epithelial Proliferation and Formation of Glands in the Mouse Uterus.
26963473|a|The endometrium consists of stromal and epithelial compartments (luminal and glandular) with distinct functions in the regulation of uterine homeostasis. Ovarian sex steroids, namely 17b-estradiol and progesterone, play essential roles in modulating uterine cell proliferation, stromal-epithelial cross-talk and differentiation in preparation for pregnancy. The effect of androgens on uterine function remains poorly understood. The current study investigated the effect of the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on mouse endometrial function. Ovx female mice were given a single sc injection (short treatment) or 7 daily injections (long treatment) of vehicle alone (5% ethanol, 0.4% methylcellulose) or vehicle with the addition of 0.2 mg DHT (n=8/group) and a single injection of bromodeoxyuridine 2 hours prior to tissue recovery. Treatment with DHT increased uterine weight, the area of the endometrial compartment and immunoexpression of the androgen receptor in the luminal and glandular epithelium. Treatment-dependent proliferation of epithelial cells was identified by immunostaining for MKi67 and bromodeoxyuridine. Real-time PCR identified significant DHT-dependent changes in the concentrations of mRNAs encoded by genes implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle (Wee1, Ccnd1, Rb1) and stromal-epithelial interactions (Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt7a, Cdh1, Vcl, Igf1, Prl8, Prlr) as well as a striking effect on the number of endometrial glands. This study has revealed a novel role for androgens in regulating uterine function with an effect on the glandular compartment of the endometrium. This previously unrecognized role for androgens has implications for our understanding of the role of androgens in regulation of endometrial function and fertility in women.

26991973|t|MOL1 is required for cambium homeostasis in Arabidopsis.
26991973|a|Plants maintain pools of pluripotent stem cells which allow them to constantly produce new tissues and organs. Stem cell homeostasis in shoot and root tips depends on negative regulation by ligand-receptor pairs of the CLE peptide and leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) families. However, regulation of the cambium, the stem cell niche required for lateral growth of shoots and roots, is poorly characterized. Here we show that the LRR-RLK MOL1 is necessary for cambium homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana. By employing promoter reporter lines, we reveal that MOL1 is active in a domain that is distinct from the domain of the positively acting CLE41/PXY signaling module. In particular, we show that MOL1 acts in an opposing manner to the CLE41/PXY module and that changing the domain or level of MOL1 expression both result in disturbed cambium organization. Underlining discrete roles of MOL1 and PXY, both LRR-RLKs are not able to replace each other when their expression domains are interchanged. Furthermore, MOL1 but not PXY is able to rescue CLV1 deficiency in the shoot apical meristem. By identifying genes mis-expressed in mol1 mutants, we demonstrate that MOL1 represses genes associated with stress-related ethylene and jasmonic acid hormone signaling pathways which have known roles in coordinating lateral growth of the Arabidopsis stem. Our findings provide evidence that common regulatory mechanisms in different plant stem cell niches are adapted to specific niche anatomies and emphasize the importance of a complex spatial organization of intercellular signaling cascades for a strictly bidirectional tissue production.

27075443|t|Yeast Gdt1 is a Golgi-localized calcium transporter required for stress-induced calcium signaling and protein glycosylation.
27075443|a|Calcium signaling depends on a tightly regulated set of pumps, exchangers, and channels that are responsible for controlling calcium fluxes between the different subcellular compartments of the eukaryotic cell. We have recently reported that two members of the highly-conserved UPF0016 family, human TMEM165 and budding yeast Gdt1p, are functionally related and might form a new group of Golgi-localized cation/Ca(2+) exchangers. Defects in the human protein TMEM165 are known to cause a subtype of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation. Using an assay based on the heterologous expression of GDT1 in the bacterium Lactococcus lactis, we demonstrated the calcium transport activity of Gdt1p. We observed a Ca(2+) uptake activity in cells expressing GDT1, which was dependent on the external pH, indicating that Gdt1p may act as a Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporter. In yeast, we found that Gdt1p controls cellular calcium stores and plays a major role in the calcium response induced by osmotic shock when the Golgi calcium pump, Pmr1p, is absent. Importantly, we also discovered that, in the presence of a high concentration of external calcium, Gdt1p is required for glycosylation of carboxypeptidase Y and the glucanosyltransferase Gas1p. Finally we showed that glycosylation process is restored by providing more Mn(2+) to the cells.

27075747|t|Anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody promotes bone fracture healing through regulating IL-20-mediated osteoblastogenesis.
27075747|a|Bone loss and skeletal fragility in bone fracture are caused by an imbalance in bone remodeling. The current challenge in bone fracture healing is to promote osteoblastogenesis and bone formation. We aimed to explore the role of IL-20 in osteoblastogenesis, osteoblast differentiation and bone fracture. Serum IL-20 was significantly correlated with serum sclerostin in patients with bone fracture. In a mouse model, anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7E increased bone formation during fracture healing. In vitro, IL-20 inhibited osteoblastogenesis by upregulating sclerostin, and downregulating osterix (OSX), RUNX2, and osteoprotegerin (OPG). IL-20R1 deficiency attenuated IL-20-mediated inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and maturation and reduced the healing time after a bone fracture. We conclude that IL-20 affects bone formation and downregulates osteoblastogenesis by modulating sclerostin, OSX, RUNX2, and OPG on osteoblasts. Our results demonstrated that IL-20 is involved in osteoregulation and anti-IL-20 mAb is a potential therapeutic for treating bone fracture or metabolic bone diseases.

27087647|t|Galectin-1 dimers can scaffold Raf-effectors to increase H-ras nanoclustering.
27087647|a|Galectin-1 (Gal-1) dimers crosslink carbohydrates on cell surface receptors. Carbohydrate-derived inhibitors have been developed for cancer treatment. Intracellularly, Gal-1 was suggested to interact with the farnesylated C-terminus of Ras thus specifically stabilizing GTP-H-ras nanoscale signalling hubs in the membrane, termed nanoclusters. The latter activity may present an alternative mechanism for how overexpressed Gal-1 stimulates tumourigenesis. Here we revise the current model for the interaction of Gal-1 with H-ras. We show that it indirectly forms a complex with GTP-H-ras via a high-affinity interaction with the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Ras effectors. A computationally generated model of the Gal-1/C-Raf-RBD complex is validated by mutational analysis. Both cellular FRET as well as proximity ligation assay experiments confirm interaction of Gal-1 with Raf proteins in mammalian cells. Consistently, interference with H-rasG12V-effector interactions basically abolishes H-ras nanoclustering. In addition, an intact dimer interface of Gal-1 is required for it to positively regulate H-rasG12V nanoclustering, but negatively K-rasG12V nanoclustering. Our findings suggest stacked dimers of H-ras, Raf and Gal-1 as building blocks of GTP-H-ras-nanocluster at high Gal-1 levels. Based on our results the Gal-1/effector interface represents a potential drug target site in diseases with aberrant Ras signalling.

27093923|t|NLRP3 Localizes to the Tubular Epithelium in Human Kidney and Correlates With Outcome in IgA Nephropathy.
27093923|a|Nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental renal injury, yet its characterization in human kidney disease remains largely unexplored. NLRP3 expression was evaluated in human kidney biopsies, primary renal tubular cells (HPTC) and correlated to disease outcomes in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). NLRP3 localized to renal tubules in normal human kidney tissue and to mitochondria within HPTC by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Compared to control kidneys, NLRP3 gene expression was increased in biopsies of patients with IgAN. While NLRP3 expression in IgAN was detected in glomeruli, it remained largely confined to the tubular epithelial compartment. In vitro NLRP3 mRNA and protein expression were transiently induced in HPTC by TGF-b1 but subsequently diminished over time as cells lost their epithelial phenotype in a process regulated by transcription and ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Consistent with the in vitro data, low NLRP3 mRNA expression in kidney biopsies was associated with a linear trend of higher risk of composite endpoint of doubling serum creatinine and end stage renal disease in patients with IgAN. Taken together, these data show that NLRP3 is primarily a kidney tubule-expressed protein that decreases in abundance in progressive IgAN.

27099072|t|Human wild-type full-length tau accumulation disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and the functions via increasing mitofusins.
27099072|a|Intracellular accumulation of tau protein is hallmark of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the cellular mechanism whereby tau accumulation causes neurodegeneration is poorly understood. Here we report that overexpression of human wild-type full-length tau (termed htau) disrupted mitochondrial dynamics by enhancing fusion and induced their perinuclear accumulation in HEK293 cells and rat primary hippocampal neurons. The htau accumulation at later stage inhibited mitochondrial functions shown by the decreased ATP level, the ratio of ATP/ADP and complex I activity. Simultaneously, the cell viability was decreased with retraction of the cellular/neuronal processes. Further studies demonstrated that htau accumulation increased fusion proteins, including OPA1 and mitofusins (Mfn1, Mfn2) and reduced the ubiquitination of Mfn2. Downregulation of the mitofusins by shRNA to ~45% or ~52% of the control levels attenuated the htau-enhanced mitochondrial fusion and restored the functions, while downregulation of OPA1 to ~50% of the control level did not show rescue effects. Finally, abnormal mitochondrial accumulation and dysfunction were also observed in the brains of htau transgenic mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate that htau accumulation decreases cell viability and causes degeneration via enhancing mitofusin-associated mitochondrial fusion, which provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies.

27103577|t|On the pivotal role of PPARa in adaptation of the heart to hypoxia and why fat in the diet increases hypoxic injury.
27103577|a|The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa)-mediated metabolic remodeling in cardiac adaptation to hypoxia has yet to be defined. Here, mice were housed in hypoxia for 3 wk before in vivo contractile function was measured using cine MRI. In isolated, perfused hearts, energetics were measured using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation were measured using [(3)H] labeling. Compared with a normoxic, chow-fed control mouse heart, hypoxia decreased PPARa expression, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) levels, while increasing glycolysis, all of which served to maintain normal ATP concentrations ([ATP]) and thereby, ejection fractions. A high-fat diet increased cardiac PPARa expression, fatty acid oxidation, and UCP3 levels with decreased glycolysis. Hypoxia was unable to alter the high PPARa expression or reverse the metabolic changes caused by the high-fat diet, with the result that [ATP] and contractile function decreased significantly. The adaptive metabolic changes caused by hypoxia in control mouse hearts were found to have occurred already in PPARa-deficient (PPARa(-/-)) mouse hearts and sustained function in hypoxia despite an inability for further metabolic remodeling. We conclude that decreased cardiac PPARa expression is essential for adaptive metabolic remodeling in hypoxia, but is prevented by dietary fat.-Cole, M. A., Abd Jamil, A. H., Heather, L.

27110091|t|The leaves of Diospyros kaki exert beneficial effects on a benzalkonium chloride-induced murine dry eye model.
27110091|a|PURPOSE: In this study, the beneficial effects of the oral administration of ethanol extract of Diospyros kaki (EEDK) were tested on a mouse dry eye model induced by benzalkonium chloride (BAC). METHODS: A solution of 0.2% BAC was administered topically to mouse eyes for 14 days, twice daily, to induce dry eye. Various concentrations of EEDK were administrated daily by oral gavage for 14 days after BAC treatment. Preservative-free eye drops were instilled in the positive-control group. The tear secretion volume (Schirmer's test), tear break-up time (BUT), and fluorescein score were measured on the ocular surface. BAC-induced corneal damage was tested with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Moreover, apoptotic cell death in the corneal epithelial layer was investigated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The protein expression level of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1a), IL-1b, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-a), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) was determined with western blot analysis. Furthermore, squamous metaplasia in the corneal epithelial layer was detected with immunofluorescent staining for cytokeratine-10. The cellular proliferation in the cornea was examined with immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67. RESULTS: EEDK treatment resulted in prolonged BUT, decreased fluorescein score, increased tear volume, and smoother epithelial cells compared with BAC treatment alone in the cornea. Moreover, EEDK treatment inhibited the inflammatory response and corneal epithelial cell death in a BAC-induced murine dry eye model, and changes in squamous cells were inhibited. Proliferative activity in the corneal epithelium cells was improved with EEDK. CONCLUSIONS: EEDK could be a potential therapeutic agent in the clinical treatment of dry eye.

27111890|t|Long noncoding RNA LINP1 regulates repair of DNA double-strand breaks in triple-negative breast cancer.
27111890|a|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles during tumorigenesis by functioning as scaffolds that regulate protein-protein, protein-DNA or protein-RNA interactions. Using a clinically guided genetic screening approach, we identified lncRNA in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway 1 (LINP1), which is overexpressed in human triple-negative breast cancer. We found that LINP1 enhances repair of DNA double-strand breaks by serving as a scaffold linking Ku80 and DNA-PKcs, thereby coordinating the NHEJ pathway. Importantly, blocking LINP1, which is regulated by p53 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, increases the sensitivity of the tumor-cell response to radiotherapy in breast cancer.

27134166|t|Metabolic Symbiosis Enables Adaptive Resistance to Anti-angiogenic Therapy that Is Dependent on mTOR Signaling.
27134166|a|Therapeutic targeting of tumor angiogenesis with VEGF inhibitors results in demonstrable, but transitory efficacy in certain human tumors and mouse models of cancer, limited by unconventional forms of adaptive/evasive resistance. In one such mouse model, potent angiogenesis inhibitors elicit compartmental reorganization of cancer cells around remaining blood vessels. The glucose and lactate transporters GLUT1 and MCT4 are induced in distal hypoxic cells in a HIF1a-dependent fashion, indicative of glycolysis. Tumor cells proximal to blood vessels instead express the lactate transporter MCT1, and p-S6, the latter reflecting mTOR signaling. Normoxic cancer cells import and metabolize lactate, resulting in upregulation of mTOR signaling via glutamine metabolism enhanced by lactate catabolism. Thus, metabolic symbiosis is established in the face of angiogenesis inhibition, whereby hypoxic cancer cells import glucose and export lactate, while normoxic cells import and catabolize lactate. mTOR signaling inhibition disrupts this metabolic symbiosis, associated with upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT2.

27167772|t|Progesterone-Dependent Induction of Phospholipase C-Related Catalytically Inactive Protein 1 (PRIP-1) in Decidualizing Human Endometrial Stromal Cells.
27167772|a|Decidualization denotes the transformation of endometrial stromal cells into specialized decidual cells. In pregnancy, decidual cells form a protective matrix around the implanting embryo, enabling coordinated trophoblast invasion and formation of a functional placenta. Continuous progesterone (P4) signaling renders decidual cells resistant to various environmental stressors, whereas withdrawal inevitably triggers tissue breakdown and menstruation or miscarriage. Here, we show that PLCL1, coding phospholipase C (PLC)-related catalytically inactive protein 1 (PRIP-1), is highly induced in response to P4 signaling in decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs). Knockdown experiments in undifferentiated HESCs revealed that PRIP-1 maintains basal phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Protein kinase B activity, which in turn prevents illicit nuclear translocation of the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 and induction of the apoptotic activator BIM. By contrast, loss of this scaffold protein did not compromise survival of decidual cells. PRIP-1 knockdown did also not interfere with the responsiveness of HESCs to deciduogenic cues, although the overall expression of differentiation markers, such as PRL, IGFBP1, and WNT4, was blunted. Finally, we show that PRIP-1 in decidual cells uncouples PLC activation from intracellular Ca(2+) release by attenuating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate signaling. In summary, PRIP-1 is a multifaceted P4-inducible scaffold protein that gates the activity of major signal transduction pathways in the endometrium. It prevents apoptosis of proliferating stromal cells and contributes to the relative autonomy of decidual cells by silencing PLC signaling downstream of Gq protein-coupled receptors.

27183470|t|Medial HOXA genes demarcate haematopoietic stem cell fate during human development.
27183470|a|Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) may provide a potential source of haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) for transplantation; however, unknown molecular barriers prevent the self-renewal of PSC-HSPCs. Using two-step differentiation, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiated in vitro into multipotent haematopoietic cells that had the CD34(+)CD38(-/lo)CD90(+)CD45(+)GPI-80(+) fetal liver (FL) HSPC immunophenotype, but exhibited poor expansion potential and engraftment ability. Transcriptome analysis of immunophenotypic hESC-HSPCs revealed that, despite their molecular resemblance to FL-HSPCs, medial HOXA genes remained suppressed. Knockdown of HOXA7 disrupted FL-HSPC function and caused transcriptome dysregulation that resembled hESC-derived progenitors. Overexpression of medial HOXA genes prolonged FL-HSPC maintenance but was insufficient to confer self-renewal to hESC-HSPCs. Stimulation of retinoic acid signalling during endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition induced the HOXA cluster and other HSC/definitive haemogenic endothelium genes, and prolonged HSPC maintenance in culture. Thus, medial HOXA gene expression induced by retinoic acid signalling marks the establishment of the definitive HSPC fate and controls HSPC identity and function.

27184800|t|Metallothionein-1 as a biomarker of altered redox metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma cells exposed to sorafenib.
27184800|a|BACKGROUND: Sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor active against various solid tumours, induces oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a new form of oxidative necrosis, in some cancer cells. Clinically-applicable biomarkers that reflect the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells are lacking. METHODS: We used gene expression microarrays, real-time PCR, immunoblot, protein-specific ELISA, and gene reporter constructs encoding the enzyme luciferase to study the response of a panel of cancer cells to sorafenib. Tumour explants prepared from surgical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples and serum samples obtained from HCC patients receiving sorafenib were also used. RESULTS: We observed that genes of the metallothionein-1 (MT1) family are induced in the HCC cell line Huh7 exposed to sorafenib. Sorafenib increased the expression of MT1G mRNA in a panel of human cancer cells, an effect that was not observed with eight other clinically-approved kinase inhibitors. We identified the minimal region of the MT1G promoter that confers inducibility by sorafenib to a 133 base pair region containing an Anti-oxidant Response Element (ARE) and showed the essential role of the transcription factor NRF2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2). We examined the clinical relevance of our findings by analysing the regulation of MT1G in five tumour explants prepared from surgical HCC samples. Finally, we showed that the protein levels of MT1 increase in the serum of some HCC patients receiving sorafenib, and found an association with reduced overall survival. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that MT1 constitute a biomarker adapted for exploring the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells.

27239034|t|Telomere Replication Stress Induced by POT1 Inactivation Accelerates Tumorigenesis.
27239034|a|Genome sequencing studies have revealed a number of cancer-associated mutations in the telomere-binding factor POT1. Here, we show that when combined with p53 deficiency, depletion of murine POT1a in common lymphoid progenitor cells fosters genetic instability, accelerates the onset, and increases the severity of T cell lymphomas. In parallel, we examined human and mouse cells carrying POT1 mutations found in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients. Inhibition of POT1 activates ATR-dependent DNA damage signaling and induces telomere fragility, replication fork stalling, and telomere elongation. Our data suggest that these phenotypes are linked to impaired CST (CTC1-STN1-TEN1) function at telomeres. Lastly, we show that proliferation of cancer cells lacking POT1 is enabled by the attenuation of the ATR kinase pathway. These results uncover a role for defective telomere replication during tumorigenesis.

27288531|t|Loss of the Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase PTPN22 Reduces Mannan-Induced Autoimmune Arthritis in SKG Mice.
27288531|a|The cytoplasmic phosphatase, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22), is a negative regulator of T cell signaling. Genome-wide association studies have shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PTPN22 confer an increased risk of developing multiple autoimmune diseases in humans. The precise function of PTPN22 and how the variant protein contributes to autoimmunity is not well understood. To address this issue, we investigated the effect of PTPN22 deficiency on disease susceptibility in a mouse model of autoimmune arthritis. The SKG mouse expresses a hypomorphic mutant allele of ZAP70, which, upon exposure to fungal Ags, predisposes the mice to a CD4(+) T cell-mediated autoimmune arthritis that closely resembles rheumatoid arthritis in humans. Surprisingly, SKG Ptpn22(-/-) mice developed less severe mannan-induced arthritis compared with SKG mice. Diminution of disease was not due to significant alterations in thymocyte development or repertoire selection in SKG Ptpn22(-/-) mice, even though T cell-mediated signal transduction was improved. Instead, Ptpn22 deficiency appeared to bias CD4 Th cell differentiation away from the Th17 lineage, which is pathogenic in this setting, to a more Th1/T regulatory-focused response. These data show that even small perturbations in TCR signal transduction pathways can have profound consequences on the differentiation of T cell lineages and thus for the development of autoimmune diseases.

27292648|t|T-bet Activates Th1 Genes through Mediator and the Super Elongation Complex.
27292648|a|The transcription factor T-bet directs Th1 cell differentiation, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie this lineage-specific gene regulation are not completely understood. Here, we show that T-bet acts through enhancers to allow the recruitment of Mediator and P-TEFb in the form of the super elongation complex (SEC). Th1 genes are occupied by H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II in Th2 cells, while T-bet-mediated recruitment of P-TEFb in Th1 cells activates transcriptional elongation. P-TEFb is recruited to both genes and enhancers, where it activates enhancer RNA transcription. P-TEFb inhibition and Mediator and SEC knockdown selectively block activation of T-bet target genes, and P-TEFb inhibition abrogates Th1-associated experimental autoimmune uveitis. T-bet activity is independent of changes in NF-kB RelA and Brd4 binding, with T-bet- and NF-kB-mediated pathways instead converging to allow P-TEFb recruitment. These data provide insight into the mechanism through which lineage-specifying factors promote differentiation of alternative T cell fates.

27295129|t|Investigating core genetic-and-epigenetic cell cycle networks for stemness and carcinogenic mechanisms, and cancer drug design using big database mining and genome-wide next-generation sequencing data.
27295129|a|Recent studies have demonstrated that cell cycle plays a central role in development and carcinogenesis. Thus, the use of big databases and genome-wide high-throughput data to unravel the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying cell cycle progression in stem cells and cancer cells is a matter of considerable interest. Real genetic-and-epigenetic cell cycle networks (GECNs) of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and HeLa cancer cells were constructed by applying system modeling, system identification, and big database mining to genome-wide next-generation sequencing data. Real GECNs were then reduced to core GECNs of HeLa cells and ESCs by applying principal genome-wide network projection. In this study, we investigated potential carcinogenic and stemness mechanisms for systems cancer drug design by identifying common core and specific GECNs between HeLa cells and ESCs. Integrating drug database information with the specific GECNs of HeLa cells could lead to identification of multiple drugs for cervical cancer treatment with minimal side-effects on the genes in the common core. We found that dysregulation of miR-29C, miR-34A, miR-98, and miR-215; and methylation of ANKRD1, ARID5B, CDCA2, PIF1, STAMBPL1, TROAP, ZNF165, and HIST1H2AJ in HeLa cells could result in cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis through NFkB, TGF-b, and PI3K pathways. We also identified 3 drugs, methotrexate, quercetin, and mimosine, which repressed the activated cell cycle genes, ARID5B, STK17B, and CCL2, in HeLa cells with minimal side-effects.

27378692|t|A recurrent p.Arg92Trp variant in steroidogenic factor-1 (NR5A1) can act as a molecular switch in human sex development.
27378692|a|Cell lineages of the early human gonad commit to one of the two mutually antagonistic organogenetic fates, the testis or the ovary. Some individuals with a 46,XX karyotype develop testes or ovotestes (testicular or ovotesticular disorder of sex development; TDSD/OTDSD), due to the presence of the testis-determining gene, SRY Other rare complex syndromic forms of TDSD/OTDSD are associated with mutations in pro-ovarian genes that repress testis development (e.g. WNT4); however, the genetic cause of the more common non-syndromic forms is unknown. Steroidogenic factor-1 (known as NR5A1) is a key regulator of reproductive development and function. Loss-of-function changes in NR5A1 in 46,XY individuals are associated with a spectrum of phenotypes in humans ranging from a lack of testis formation to male infertility. Mutations in NR5A1 in 46,XX women are associated with primary ovarian insufficiency, which includes a lack of ovary formation, primary and secondary amenorrhoea as well as early menopause. Here, we show that a specific recurrent heterozygous missense mutation (p.Arg92Trp) in the accessory DNA-binding region of NR5A1 is associated with variable degree of testis development in 46,XX children and adults from four unrelated families. Remarkably, in one family a sibling raised as a girl and carrying this NR5A1 mutation was found to have a 46,XY karyotype with partial testicular dysgenesis. These unique findings highlight how a specific variant in a developmental transcription factor can switch organ fate from the ovary to testis in mammals and represents the first missense mutation causing isolated, non-syndromic 46,XX testicular/ovotesticular DSD in humans.

27384305|t|Male 11b-HSD1 Knockout Mice Fed Trans-Fats and Fructose Are Not Protected From Metabolic Syndrome or Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.
27384305|a|Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) defines a spectrum of conditions from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis and is regarded as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. Glucocorticoids can promote steatosis by stimulating lipolysis within adipose tissue, free fatty acid delivery to liver and hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Glucocorticoids can be reactivated in liver through 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b-HSD1) enzyme activity. Inhibition of 11b-HSD1 has been suggested as a potential treatment for NAFLD. To test this, male mice with global (11b-HSD1 knockout [KO]) and liver-specific (LKO) 11b-HSD1 loss of function were fed the American Lifestyle Induced Obesity Syndrome (ALIOS) diet, known to recapitulate the spectrum of NAFLD, and metabolic and liver phenotypes assessed. Body weight, muscle and adipose tissue masses, and parameters of glucose homeostasis showed that 11b-HSD1KO and LKO mice were not protected from systemic metabolic disease. Evaluation of hepatic histology, triglyceride content, and blinded NAFLD activity score assessment indicated that levels of steatosis were similar between 11b-HSD1KO, LKO, and control mice. Unexpectedly, histological analysis revealed significantly increased levels of immune foci present in livers of 11b-HSD1KO but not LKO or control mice, suggestive of a transition to NASH. This was endorsed by elevated hepatic expression of key immune cell and inflammatory markers. These data indicate that 11b-HSD1-deficient mice are not protected from metabolic disease or hepatosteatosis in the face of a NAFLD-inducing diet. However, global deficiency of 11b-HSD1 did increase markers of hepatic inflammation and suggests a critical role for 11b-HSD1 in restraining the transition to NASH.

27460078|t|VHL-deficient renal cancer cells gain resistance to mitochondria-activating apoptosis inducers by activating AKT through the IGF1R-PI3K pathway.
27460078|a|We previously developed (2-deoxyglucose)-(ABT-263) combination therapy (2DG-ABT), which induces apoptosis by activating Bak in the mitochondria of highly glycolytic cells with varied genetic backgrounds. However, the rates of apoptosis induced by 2DG-ABT were lower in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-deficient cancer cells. The re-expression of VHL protein in these cells lowered IGF1R expression in a manner independent of oxygen concentration. Lowering IGF1R expression via small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitized the cells to 2DG-ABT, suggesting that IGF1R interfered with the activation of apoptosis by the mitochondria. To determine which of the two pathways activated by IGF1R, the Ras-ERK pathway or the PI3K-AKT pathway, was involved in the impairment of mitochondria activation, the cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of either PI3K or ERK, and 2DG-ABT was added to activate the mitochondria. The apoptotic rates resulting from 2DG-ABT treatment were higher in the cells treated with the PI3K inhibitor, while the rates remained approximately the same in the cells treated with the ERK inhibitor. In 2DG-ABT-sensitive cells, a 4-h 2DG treatment caused the dissociation of Mcl-1 from Bak, while ABT treatment alone caused the dissociation of Bcl-xL from Bak without substantially reducing Mcl-1 levels. In 2DG-ABT-resistant cells, Mcl-1 dissociated from Bak only when AKT activity was inhibited during the 4-h 2DG treatment. Thus, in VHL-deficient cells, IGF1R activated AKT and stabilized the Bak-Mcl-1 complex, thereby conferring cell resistance to apoptosis.

27466378|t|A role for the yeast CLIP170 ortholog, the plus-end-tracking protein Bik1, and the Rho1 GTPase in Snc1 trafficking.
27466378|a|The diversity of microtubule functions is dependent on the status of tubulin C-termini. To address the physiological role of the C-terminal aromatic residue of a-tubulin, a tub1-Glu yeast strain expressing an a-tubulin devoid of its C-terminal amino acid was used to perform a genome-wide-lethality screen. The identified synthetic lethal genes suggested links with endocytosis and related processes. In the tub1-Glu strain, the routing of the v-SNARE Snc1 was strongly impaired, with a loss of its polarized distribution in the bud, and Abp1, an actin patch or endocytic marker, developed comet-tail structures. Snc1 trafficking required dynamic microtubules but not dynein and kinesin motors. Interestingly, deletion of the microtubule plus-end-tracking protein Bik1 (a CLIP170 ortholog), which is preferentially recruited to the C-terminal residue of a-tubulin, similarly resulted in Snc1 trafficking defects. Finally, constitutively active Rho1 rescued both Bik1 localization at the microtubule plus-ends in tub1-Glu strain and a correct Snc1 trafficking in a Bik1-dependent manner. Our results provide the first evidence for a role of microtubule plus-ends in membrane cargo trafficking in yeast, through Rho1- and Bik1-dependent mechanisms, and highlight the importance of the C-terminal a-tubulin amino acid in this process.

27473374|t|Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) in hepatic stellate cells - evidence for a role in hepatocellular carcinoma growth in vivo.
27473374|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have established that proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) promotes migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, suggesting a role in HCC progression. Here, we assessed the impact of PAR2 in HCC stromal cells on HCC growth using LX-2 hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and Hep3B cells as model. METHODS: PAR2 expression and function in LX-2 cells was analysed by RT-PCR, confocal immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and [Ca(2+)]i measurements, respectively. The impact of LX-2-expressed PAR2 on tumour growth in vivo was monitored using HCC xenotransplantation experiments in SCID mice, in which HCC-like tumours were induced by coinjection of LX-2 cells and Hep3B cells. To characterise the effects of PAR2 activation in LX-2 cells, various signalling pathways were analysed by immunoblotting and proteome profiler arrays. RESULTS: Following verification of functional PAR2 expression in LX-2 cells, in vivo studies showed that these cells promoted tumour growth and angiogenesis of HCC xenografts in mice. These effects were significantly reduced when F2RL1 (encoding PAR2) was downregulated by RNA interference (RNAi). In vitro studies confirmed these results demonstrating RNAi mediated inhibition of PAR2 attenuated Smad2/3 activation in response to TGF-b1 stimulation in LX-2 cells and blocked the pro-mitotic effect of LX-2 derived conditioned medium on Hep3B cells. Furthermore, PAR2 stimulation with trypsin or a PAR2-selective activating peptide (PAR2-AP) led to activation of different intracellular signalling pathways, an increased secretion of pro-angiogenic and pro-mitotic factors and proteinases, and an enhanced migration rate across a collagen-coated membrane barrier. Silencing F2RL1 by RNAi or pharmacological inhibition of Src, hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), p42/p44 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) or matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) blocked PAR2-AP-induced migration. CONCLUSION: PAR2 in HSCs plays a crucial role in promoting HCC growth presumably by mediating migration and secretion of pro-angiogenic and pro-mitotic factors. Therefore, PAR2 in stromal HSCs may have relevance as a therapeutic target of HCC.

27502584|t|MicroRNA-203 mimics age-related aortic smooth muscle dysfunction of cytoskeletal pathways.
27502584|a|Increased aortic stiffness is a biomarker for subsequent adverse cardiovascular events. We have previously reported that vascular smooth muscle Src-dependent cytoskeletal remodelling, which contributes to aortic plasticity, is impaired with ageing. Here, we use a multi-scale approach to determine the molecular mechanisms behind defective Src-dependent signalling in an aged C57BL/6 male mouse model. Increased aortic stiffness, as measured in vivo by pulse wave velocity, was found to have a comparable time course to that in humans. Bioinformatic analyses predicted several miRs to regulate Src-dependent cytoskeletal remodelling. qRT-PCR was used to determine the relative levels of predicted miRs in aortas and, notably, the expression of miR-203 increased almost twofold in aged aorta. Increased miR-203 expression was associated with a decrease in both mRNA and protein expression of Src, caveolin-1 and paxillin in aged aorta. Probing with phospho-specific antibodies confirmed that overexpression of miR-203 significantly attenuated Src and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) signalling, which we have previously found to regulate vascular smooth muscle stiffness. In addition, transfection of miR-203 into aortic tissue from young mice increased phenylephrine-induced aortic stiffness ex vivo, mimicking the aged phenotype. Upstream of miR-203, we found that DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) 1, 3a, and 3b are also significantly decreased in the aged mouse aorta and that DNMT inhibition significantly increases miR-203 expression. Thus, the age-induced increase in miR-203 may be caused by epigenetic promoter hypomethylation in the aorta. These findings indicate that miR-203 promotes a re-programming of Src/ERK signalling pathways in vascular smooth muscle, impairing the regulation of stiffness in aged aorta.

27509880|t|Combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide and 5-fluorouracil upregulates major histocompatibility complex class II and p21 genes and activates caspase-3/7 in human colon cancer HCT-116 cells.
27509880|a|Epigenetic anticancer drugs such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been combined with existing anticancer drugs for synergistic or additive effects. In the present study, we found that a very low concentration of depsipeptide, an HDAC inhibitor, potentiated the antitumor activity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in a human colon cancer cell model using HCT-116, HT29, and SW48 cells via the inhibition of colony formation ability or cellular viability. Exposure to a combination of 5-FU (1.75 uM) and 1 nM depsipeptide for 24 and 48 h resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increase in activated caspase-3/7, while 5-FU alone failed to activate caspase-3/7. Microarray and subsequent gene ontology analyses revealed that compared to 5-FU or depsipeptide alone, the combination treatment of 5-FU and depsipeptide upregulated genes related to cell death and the apoptotic process consistent with the inhibition of colony formation and caspase-3/7 activation. These analyses indicated marked upregulation of antigen processing and presentation of peptide or polysaccharide antigen via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class (GO:0002504) and MHC protein complex (GO:0042611). Compared with vehicle controls, the cells treated with the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide showed marked induction (3- to 8.5-fold) of expression of MHC class II genes, but not of MHC class I genes. Furthermore, our global analysis of gene expression, which was focused on genes involved in the molecular regulation of MHC class II genes, showed enhancement of pro-apoptotic PCAF and CIITA after the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide. These results may indicate a closer relationship between elevation of MHC class II expression and cellular apoptosis induced by the combination of depsipeptide and 5-FU. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide induces human colon cancer cell apoptosis in a concerted manner with the induction of MHC class II gene expression.

27516442|t|IGFBP1 increases b-cell regeneration by promoting a- to b-cell transdifferentiation.
27516442|a|There is great interest in therapeutically harnessing endogenous regenerative mechanisms to increase the number of b cells in people with diabetes. By performing whole-genome expression profiling of zebrafish islets, we identified 11 secreted proteins that are upregulated during b-cell regeneration. We then tested the proteins' ability to potentiate b-cell regeneration in zebrafish at supraphysiological levels. One protein, insulin-like growth factor (Igf) binding-protein 1 (Igfbp1), potently promoted b-cell regeneration by potentiating a- to b-cell transdifferentiation. Using various inhibitors and activators of the Igf pathway, we show that Igfbp1 exerts its regenerative effect, at least partly, by inhibiting Igf signaling. Igfbp1's effect on transdifferentiation appears conserved across species: Treating mouse and human islets with recombinant IGFBP1 in vitro increased the number of cells co-expressing insulin and glucagon threefold. Moreover, a prospective human study showed that having high IGFBP1 levels reduces the risk of developing type-2 diabetes by more than 85%. Thus, we identify IGFBP1 as an endogenous promoter of b-cell regeneration and highlight its clinical importance in diabetes.

27521456|t|Small RNA in situ hybridization in Caenorhabditis elegans, combined with RNA-seq, identifies germline-enriched microRNAs.
27521456|a|Over four hundred different microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in the genome of the model organism the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. As the germline is dedicated to the preservation of each species, and almost half of all the cells in an adult nematode are germline, it is likely that regulatory miRNAs are important for germline development and maintenance. In C. elegans the miR35 family has strong maternal effects, contributing to normal embryogenesis and to adult fecundity. To determine whether any particular miRNAs are greatly enriched in the C. elegans germline we used RNA-seq to compare the miRNA populations in several germline-defective strains of adult C. elegans worms, including glp-4(germline proliferation-4), glh-1(germline helicase-1) and dcr-1(dicer-1). Statistical analyses of RNA-seq comparisons identified 13 miRNAs that are germline-enriched, including seven members of the well-studied miR35 family that were reduced as much as 1000-fold in TaqMan qRT PCR miRNA assays. Along with the miR35s, six others: miR-56 (a member of the miR51 family),-70, -244, -260 , -788 and -4813, none of which previously considered as such, were also identified by RNA-seq as germline-enriched candidates. We went on to develop a successful miRNA in situ hybridization protocol for C. elegans, revealing miR35s specifically concentrate during oogenesis in the pachytene region of the gonad, and persist throughout early embryogenesis, while in adult animals neither let-7 nor miR-228 has a germline-bias.

27542569|t|FANCM c.5101C>T mutation associates with breast cancer survival and treatment outcome.
27542569|a|Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease, and different tumor characteristics and genetic variation may affect the clinical outcome. The FANCM c.5101C > T nonsense mutation in the Finnish population associates with increased risk of breast cancer, especially for triple-negative breast cancer patients. To investigate the association of the mutation with disease prognosis, we studied tumor phenotype, treatment outcome, and patient survival in 3,933 invasive breast cancer patients, including 101 FANCM c.5101C > T mutation carriers and 3,832 non-carriers. We also examined association of the mutation with nuclear immunohistochemical staining of DNA repair markers in 1,240 breast tumors. The FANCM c.5101C > T mutation associated with poor 10-year breast cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio (HR)=1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.52, p = 0.018), with a more pronounced survival effect among familial cases (HR = 2.93, 95% CI 1.5-5.76, p = 1.80 x 10(-3) ). Poor disease outcome of the carriers was also found among the estrogen receptor (ER) positive subgroup of patients (HR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.09-2.98, p = 0.021). Reduced survival was seen especially among patients who had not received radiotherapy (HR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.6-7.34, p = 1.50 x 10(-3) ) but not among radiotherapy treated patients (HR = 1.35, 95% CI 0.82-2.23, p = 0.237). Significant interaction was found between the mutation and radiotherapy (p = 0.040). Immunohistochemical analyses show that c.5101C > T carriers have reduced PAR-activity. Our results suggest that FANCM c.5101C > T nonsense mutation carriers have a reduced breast cancer survival but postoperative radiotherapy may diminish this survival disadvantage.

27630165|t|Long-Lived CD4+IFN-g+ T Cells rather than Short-Lived CD4+IFN-g+IL-10+ T Cells Initiate Rapid IL-10 Production To Suppress Anamnestic T Cell Responses during Secondary Malaria Infection.
27630165|a|CD4(+) T cells that produce IFN-g are the source of host-protective IL-10 during primary infection with a number of different pathogens, including Plasmodium spp. The fate of these CD4(+)IFN-g(+)IL-10(+) T cells following clearance of primary infection and their subsequent influence on the course of repeated infections is, however, presently unknown. In this study, utilizing IFN-g-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and IL-10-GFP dual reporter mice, we show that primary malaria infection-induced CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cells have limited memory potential, do not stably express IL-10, and are disproportionately lost from the Ag-experienced CD4(+) T cell memory population during the maintenance phase postinfection. CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cells generally exhibited a short-lived effector rather than effector memory T cell phenotype postinfection and expressed high levels of PD-1, Lag-3, and TIGIT, indicative of cellular exhaustion. Consistently, the surviving CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cell-derived cells were unresponsive and failed to proliferate during the early phase of secondary infection. In contrast, CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(-) T cell-derived cells expanded rapidly and upregulated IL-10 expression during secondary infection. Correspondingly, CD4(+) T cells were the major producers within an accelerated and amplified IL-10 response during the early stage of secondary malaria infection. Notably, IL-10 exerted quantitatively stronger regulatory effects on innate and CD4(+) T cell responses during primary and secondary infections, respectively. The results in this study significantly improve our understanding of the durability of IL-10-producing CD4(+) T cells postinfection and provide information on how IL-10 may contribute to optimized parasite control and prevention of immune-mediated pathology during repeated malaria infections.

27643404|t|Alcohol consumption and prostate cancer incidence and progression: A Mendelian randomisation study.
27643404|a|Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in developed countries, and is a target for risk reduction strategies. The effects of alcohol consumption on prostate cancer incidence and survival remain unclear, potentially due to methodological limitations of observational studies. In this study, we investigated the associations of genetic variants in alcohol-metabolising genes with prostate cancer incidence and survival. We analysed data from 23,868 men with prostate cancer and 23,051 controls from 25 studies within the international PRACTICAL Consortium. Study-specific associations of 68 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 alcohol-metabolising genes (Alcohol Dehydrogenases (ADHs) and Aldehyde Dehydrogenases (ALDHs)) with prostate cancer diagnosis and prostate cancer-specific mortality, by grade, were assessed using logistic and Cox regression models, respectively. The data across the 25 studies were meta-analysed using fixed-effect and random-effects models. We found little evidence that variants in alcohol metabolising genes were associated with prostate cancer diagnosis. Four variants in two genes exceeded the multiple testing threshold for associations with prostate cancer mortality in fixed-effect meta-analyses. SNPs within ALDH1A2 associated with prostate cancer mortality were rs1441817 (fixed effects hazard ratio, HRfixed  = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (95%CI):0.66,0.91; p values = 0.002); rs12910509, HRfixed  = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values = 0.003); and rs8041922 (HRfixed  = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values = 0.002). These SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with each other. In ALDH1B1, rs10973794 (HRfixed  = 1.43; 95%CI:1.14,1.79; p values = 0.002) was associated with prostate cancer mortality in men with low-grade prostate cancer. These results suggest that alcohol consumption is unlikely to affect prostate cancer incidence, but it may influence disease progression.

27649090|t|Elevated Hypothalamic Glucocorticoid Levels Are Associated With Obesity and Hyperphagia in Male Mice.
27649090|a|Glucocorticoid (Gc) excess, from endogenous overproduction in disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis or exogenous medical therapy, is recognized to cause adverse metabolic side effects. The Gc receptor (GR) is widely expressed throughout the body, including brain regions such as the hypothalamus. However, the extent to which chronic Gcs affect Gc concentrations in the hypothalamus and impact on GR and target genes is unknown. To investigate this, we used a murine model of corticosterone (Cort)-induced obesity and analyzed Cort levels in the hypothalamus and expression of genes relevant to Gc action. Mice were administered Cort (75 ug/mL) or ethanol (1%, vehicle) in drinking water for 4 weeks. Cort-treated mice had increased body weight, food intake, and adiposity. As expected, Cort increased plasma Cort levels at both zeitgeber time 1 and zeitgeber time 13, ablating the diurnal rhythm. Liquid chromatography dual tandem mass spectrometry revealed a 4-fold increase in hypothalamic Cort, which correlated with circulating levels and concentrations of Cort in other brain regions. This occurred despite decreased 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd11b1) expression, the gene encoding the enzyme that regenerates active Gcs, whereas efflux transporter Abcb1 mRNA was unaltered. In addition, although Cort decreased hypothalamic GR (Nr3c1) expression 2-fold, the Gc-induced leucine zipper (Tsc22d3) mRNA increased, which indicated elevated GR activation. In keeping with the development of hyperphagia and obesity, Cort increased Agrp, but there were no changes in Pomc, Npy, or Cart mRNA in the hypothalamus. In summary, chronic Cort treatment causes chronic increases in hypothalamic Cort levels and a persistent elevation in Agrp, a mediator in the development of metabolic disturbances.

27663860|t|Role of angiotensin II type 1a receptor in renal injury induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension.
27663860|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo role of angiotensin II type 1a (AT1a) receptor in renal damage as a result of hypertension by using transgenic mice with AT1a receptor gene disruption. Transgenic mice that express human liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) with or without disruption of the AT1a receptor gene (L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(-/-), and L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(+/+), respectively) were used with urinary L-FABP as an indicator of tubulointerstitial damage. Those female mice were administered subcutaneously deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt tablets plus drinking water that contained 1% saline for 28 d after uninephrectomy. In L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(+/+) mice that received DOCA-salt treatment, hypertension was induced and slight expansion of glomerular area, glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial damage were observed. In L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(-/-) mice that received DOCA-salt treatment, hypertension was similarly induced and the degree of glomerular damage was significantly more severe than in L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(+/+)-DOCA mice. Urinary L-FABP levels were significantly higher in L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(-/-)-DOCA mice compared with those in L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(+/+)-DOCA mice. Hydralazine treatment significantly attenuated renal damage that was found in L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(-/-)-DOCA mice along with a reduction in blood pressure. In summary, activation of the AT1a receptor may contribute to maintenance of the glomerular structure against hypertensive renal damage.-Hisamichi, M., Kamijo-Ikemori, A., Sugaya, T., Ichikawa, D., Natsuki, T., Hoshino, S., Kimura, K., Shibagaki, Y.

27677546|t|Increased intermediate M1-M2 macrophage polarization and improved cognition in mild cognitive impairment patients on w-3 supplementation.
27677546|a|Monocyte/macrophages of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) are defective in phagocytosis and degradation amyloid b1-42 (Ab1-42), but are improved by w-3 fatty acids (w-3s). The hypothesis of this study was that active Ab1-42 phagocytosis by macrophages prevents brain amyloidosis and thus maintains cognition. We studied the effects of self-supplementation with a drink with w-3s, antioxidants, and resveratrol on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, macrophage M1M2 phenotype [the ratio of inflammatory cluster of differentiation (CD)54+CD80 and proresolution markers CD163+CD206], and Ab1-42 phagocytosis in patients initially diagnosed as having MCI or subjective cognitive impairment (SCI). At baseline, the median MMSE score in patients in both the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) e3/e3 and ApoE e3/e4 groups was 26.0 and macrophage Ab1-42 phagocytosis was defective. The MMSE rate of change increased in the ApoE e3/e3 group a median 2.2 points per year (P = 0.015 compared to 0) but did not change in the ApoE e3/e4 group (P = 0.014 between groups). In the ApoE e3/e3 group, all patients remained cognitively stable or improved; in the ApoE e3/e4 group, 1 recovered from dementia, but 3 lapsed into dementia. The macrophage phenotype polarized in patients bearing ApoE e3/e3 to an intermediate (green zone) M1-M2 type at the rate of 0.226 U/yr, whereas in patients bearing ApoE e3/e4, polarization was negative (P = 0.08 between groups). The baseline M1M2 type in the extreme M1 (red zone) or M2 (white zone) was unfavorable for cognitive outcome. Ab1-42 phagocytosis increased in both ApoE groups (P = 0.03 in each groups). In vitro, the lipidic mediator resolvin D1 (RvD1) down regulated the M1 type in patients with ApoE e3/e3 but in some patients with e3/e4, paradoxically up-regulated the M1 type. Antioxidant/w-3/resveratrol supplementation was associated with favorable immune and cognitive responses in ApoE e3/e3 and individual patients bearing ApoE e3/e4, and brings into personalized clinical practice the immune benefits expected from w-3 mediators called resolvins. The validity of this study is limited by its small size and uncontrolled design.-Famenini, S., Rigali, E. A., Olivera-Perez, H. M., Dang, J., Chang, M T., Halder, R., Rao, R. V., Pellegrini, M., Porter, V., Bredesen, D., Fiala, M. Increased intermediate M1-M2 macrophage polarization and improved cognition in mild cognitive impairment patients on w-3 supplementation.

27679980|t|Pannexin3 inhibits TNF-a-induced inflammatory response by suppressing NF-kB signalling pathway in human dental pulp cells.
27679980|a|Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) play a crucial role in dental pulp inflammation. Pannexin 3 (Panx3), a member of Panxs (Pannexins), has been recently found to be involved in inflammation. However, the mechanism of Panx3 in human dental pulp inflammation remains unclear. In this study, the role of Panx3 in inflammatory response was firstly explored, and its potential mechanism was proposed. Immunohistochemical staining showed that Panx3 levels were diminished in inflamed human and rat dental pulp tissues. In vitro, Panx3 expression was significantly down-regulated in HDPCs following a TNF-a challenge in a concentration-dependent way, which reached the lowest level at 10 ng/ml of TNF-a. Such decrease could be reversed by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Unlike MG132, BAY 11-7082, a NF-kB inhibitor, even reinforced the inhibitory effect of TNF-a. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to investigate the role of Panx3 in inflammatory response of HDPCs. TNF-a-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6, were significantly lessened when Panx3 was overexpressed in HDPCs. Conversely, Panx3 knockdown exacerbated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, Western blot, dual-luciferase reporter assay, immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR and ELISA results showed that Panx3 participated in dental pulp inflammation in a NF-kB-dependent manner. These findings suggested that Panx3 has a defensive role in dental pulp inflammation, serving as a potential target to be exploited for the intervention of human dental pulp inflammation.

27696667|t|The anti-ageing hormone klotho induces Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defences in human aortic smooth muscle cells.
27696667|a|Vascular ageing in conditions such as atherosclerosis, diabetes and chronic kidney disease, is associated with the activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and diminished expression of antioxidant defences mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The anti-ageing hormone klotho promotes longevity and protects against cardiovascular and renal diseases. Klotho has been shown to activate Nrf2 and attenuate oxidative damage in neuronal cells, however, the mechanisms by which it protects against vascular smooth muscle cell VSMC dysfunction elicited by Angiotensin II (AngII) remain to be elucidated. AngII contributes to vascular ageing and atherogenesis by enhancing VSMC oxidative stress, senescence and apoptosis. This study demonstrates that soluble klotho (1 nM, 24 hrs) significantly induces expression of Nrf2 and the antioxidant enzymes haeme oxygenase (HO-1) and peroxiredoxin-1 (Prx-1) and enhances glutathione levels in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC). Silencing of Nrf2 attenuated the induction of HO-1 and Prx-1 expression by soluble klotho. Furthermore, soluble klotho protected against AngII-mediated HASMC apoptosis and senescence via activation of Nrf2. Thus, our findings highlight a novel Nrf2-mediated mechanism underlying the protective actions of soluble klotho in HAMSC. Targeting klotho may thus represent a therapeutic strategy against VSMC dysfunction and cardiovascular ageing.

27707793|t|MicroRNA deep sequencing in two adult stem cell populations identifies miR-501 as a novel regulator of myosin heavy chain during muscle regeneration.
27707793|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of skeletal muscle regeneration, but the underlying mechanisms are still incompletely understood. Here, comparative miRNA sequencing analysis of myogenic progenitor cells (MPs) and non-myogenic fibroblast-adipocyte progenitors (FAPs) during cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced muscle injury uncovered miR-501 as a novel muscle-specific miRNA. miR-501 is an intronic miRNA and its expression levels in MPs correlated with its host gene, chloride channel, voltage-sensitive 5 (Clcn5). Pharmacological inhibition of miR-501 dramatically blunted the induction of embryonic myosin heavy chain (MYH3) and, to a lesser extent, adult myosin isoforms during muscle regeneration, and promoted small-diameter neofibers. An unbiased target identification approach in primary myoblasts validated gigaxonin as a target of miR-501 that mimicked the effect of miR-501 inhibition on MYH3 expression. In the mdx mouse model, which models a pathological disease state, not only was miR-501 induced in regenerating skeletal muscle, but also its serum levels were increased, which correlated with the disease state of the animals. Our results suggest that miR-501 plays a key role in adult muscle regeneration and might serve as a novel serum biomarker for the activation of adult muscle stem cells.

27729412|t|Reduced adiponectin expression after high-fat diet is associated with selective up-regulation of ALDH1A1 and further retinoic acid receptor signaling in adipose tissue.
27729412|a|Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived adipokine with potent antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic activity. Long-term, high-fat diet results in gain of body weight, adiposity, further inflammatory-based cardiovascular diseases, and reduced adiponectin secretion. Vitamin A derivatives/retinoids are involved in several of these processes, which mainly take place in white adipose tissue (WAT). In this study, we examined adiponectin expression as a function of dietary high-fat and high-vitamin A conditions in mice. A decrease of adiponectin expression in addition to an up-regulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase A1 (ALDH1A1), retinoid signaling, and retinoic acid response element signaling was selectively observed in WAT of mice fed a normal-vitamin A, high-fat diet. Reduced adiponectin expression in WAT was also observed in mice fed a high-vitamin A diet. Adipocyte cell culture revealed that endogenous and synthetic retinoic acid receptor (RAR)a- and RARg-selective agonists, as well as a synthetic retinoid X receptor agonist, efficiently reduced adiponectin expression, whereas ALDH1A1 expression only increased with RAR agonists. We conclude that reduced adiponectin expression under high-fat dietary conditions is dependent on 1) increased ALDH1A1 expression in adipocytes, which does not increase all-trans-retinoic acid levels; 2) further RAR ligand-induced, WAT-selective, increased retinoic acid response element-mediated signaling; and 3) RAR ligand-dependent reduction of adiponectin expression.-Landrier, J.-F., Kasiri, E., Karkeni, E., Mihaly, J., Beke, G., Weiss, K., Lucas, R., Aydemir, G., Salles, J., Walrand, S., de Lera, A. R., Ruhl, R. Reduced adiponectin expression after high-fat diet is associated with selective up-regulation of ALDH1A1 and further retinoic acid receptor signaling in adipose tissue.

27733623|t|Nebulette is a powerful cytolinker organizing desmin and actin in mouse hearts.
27733623|a|In the hearts of patients bearing nebulette mutations, a severe general disorganization in cardiomyocytes of the extrasarcomeric desmin intermediate filament system is frequently observed. However, the molecular and functional relationship between the desmin cytoskeleton and nebulette-containing sarcomeres is still unclear. Here we report a high-affinity in vitro interaction between nebulette and desmin filaments. A major interaction site has been mapped to the desmin a-helical rod domain, indicating that the filament core is directly involved in the binding of nebulette. The disease-mutant desmin variants E245D and T453I exhibited increased binding affinity for nebulette, delayed filament assembly kinetics, and caused significant weakening of networks. In isolated chick cardiomyocytes and sections from canine heart, we revealed by ground-state depletion and confocal microscopies that module 5 of nebulette extends outward from Z-disk-associated desmin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. Accordingly, in the myocardium of Des(-/-) mice, elevated levels of cardiac actin correlated with alterations in the distribution of nebulette. Our data suggest that a well-organized desmin network is required to accommodate an optimal conformation of nebulette on sarcomeres to bind and recruit cardiac a-actin. Hence we propose that nebulette acts in synergy with nebulin to reinforce and temporally fine-tune striated muscle relaxation-contraction cycles.

27737911|t|Drosophila vinculin is more harmful when hyperactive than absent, and can circumvent integrin to form adhesion complexes.
27737911|a|Vinculin is a highly conserved protein involved in cell adhesion and mechanotransduction, and both gain and loss of its activity causes defective cell behaviour. Here, we examine how altering vinculin activity perturbs integrin function within the context of Drosophila development. Whereas loss of vinculin produced relatively minor phenotypes, gain of vinculin activity, through a loss of head-tail autoinhibition, caused lethality. The minimal domain capable of inducing lethality is the talin-binding D1 domain, and this appears to require talin-binding activity, as lethality was suppressed by competition with single vinculin-binding sites from talin. Activated Drosophila vinculin triggered the formation of cytoplasmic adhesion complexes through the rod of talin, but independently of integrin. These complexes contain a subset of adhesion proteins but no longer link the membrane to actin. The negative effects of hyperactive vinculin were segregated into morphogenetic defects caused by its whole head domain and lethality caused by its D1 domain. These findings demonstrate the crucial importance of the tight control of the activity of vinculin.

27748834|t|MEK inhibitors against MET-amplified non-small cell lung cancer.
27748834|a|Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including EGFR, ALK, and MET have been identified as therapeutic targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Among the downstream pathways of RTKs, the MAPK pathway is particularly important for cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In this study, the effects of MEK inhibitors (trametinib and PD0325901) in several NSCLC cell lines with driver gene alterations, especially RTK genes, were tested in vitro using an MTT assay, and a wide range of sensitivities was found. In particular, all the EGFR-mutated cell lines were resistant to MEK inhibitors, whereas all the MET-amplified cell lines were sensitive. A bioinformatics technique and western blot analyses showed that the PI3K/AKT pathway is more activated in EGFR-mutated NSCLC than in MET-amplified NSCLC, and a PI3K inhibitor enhanced the sensitivity to trametinib in the EGFR-mutated cell lines, suggesting that this pathway is associated with resistance to MEK inhibitors. Although the HCC827 cell line (EGFR mutation) was resistant to MEK inhibitors, the HCC827CNXR cell line, whose driver gene shifts from EGFR to MET, exhibited enhanced sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, indicating the biological importance of the MAPK pathway for MET-amplified NCSLC. Furthermore, a synergistic effect of crizotinib (a MET inhibitor) and trametinib was observed in MET-amplified NCLC cell lines. Our findings indicate that the MAPK pathway is biologically important for MET-amplified NSCLC and strongly encourage the development of combination therapy with a MET inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor against MET-amplified NSCLC.

27756325|t|Less is more: low expression of MT1-MMP is optimal to promote migration and tumourigenesis of breast cancer cells.
27756325|a|BACKGROUND: Membrane Type-1 Matrix Metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is a multifunctional protease implicated in metastatic progression ostensibly due to its ability to degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) components and allow migration of cells through the basement membrane. Despite in vitro studies demonstrating this principle, this knowledge has not translated into the use of MMP inhibitors (MMPi) as effective cancer therapeutics, or been corroborated by evidence of in vivo ECM degradation mediated by MT1-MMP, suggesting that our understanding of the role of MT1-MMP in cancer progression is incomplete. METHODS: MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cell lines were created that stably overexpress different levels of MT1-MMP. Using 2D culture, we analyzed proMMP-2 activation (gelatin zymography), ECM degradation (fluorescent gelatin), ERK signaling (immunoblot), cell migration (transwell/scratch closure/time-lapse imaging), and viability (colorimetric substrate) to assess how different MT1-MMP levels affect these cellular parameters. We also utilized Matrigel 3D cell culture and avian embryos to examine how different levels of MT1-MMP expression affect morphological changes in 3D culture, and tumourigenecity and extravasation efficiency in vivo. RESULTS: In 2D culture, breast cancer cells expressing high levels of MT1-MMP were capable of widespread ECM degradation and TIMP-2-mediated proMMP-2 activation, but were not the most migratory. Instead, cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP were the most migratory, and demonstrated increased viability and ERK activation. In 3D culture, MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP demonstrated an invasive protrusive phenotype, whereas cells expressing high levels of MT1-MMP demonstrated loss of colony structure and cell fragment release. Similarly, in vivo analysis demonstrated increased tumourigenecity and metastatic capability for cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP, whereas cells expressing high levels were devoid of these qualities despite the production of functional MT1-MMP protein. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that excessive ECM degradation mediated by high levels of MT1-MMP is not associated with cell migration and tumourigenesis, while low levels of MT1-MMP promote invasion and vascularization in vivo.

27779699|t|Differential expression of filamin B splice variants in giant cell tumor cells.
27779699|a|Giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) is the most commonly reported non-malignant bone tumor in Hong Kong. This kind of tumor usually affects people aged 20-40 years. Also, it is well known for recurrence locally, especially when the tumor cannot be removed completely. Filamins are actin-binding proteins which contain three family members, filamin A, B and C. They are the products of three different genes, FLNA, FLNB and FLNC, which can generate various transcript variants in different cell types. In this study, we focused on the effects of FLNBv2 and FLNBv4 toward GCT cells. The only difference between FLNBv2 and FLNBv4 is that FLNBv4 does not contain hinge 1 region. We found that the relative abundance of FLNBv4 varies among different GCT cell lines while the expression level of FLNBv4 in normal osteoblasts was only marginally detectable. In the functional aspect, overexpression of FLNBv4 led to upregulation of RANKL, OCN, OPG and RUNX2, which are closely related to GCT cell survival and differentiation. Moreover, FLNBv4 can have a negative effect on cell viability of GCT cells when compare with FLNBv2. In conclusion, splicing variants of FLNB are differentially expressed in GCT cells and may play a role in the proliferation and differentiation of tumor cells.

27798105|t|Effects of the Bowen-Conradi syndrome mutation in EMG1 on its nuclear import, stability and nucleolar recruitment.
27798105|a|Bowen-Conradi syndrome (BCS) is a severe genetic disorder that is characterised by various developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure and early infant death. This disease is caused by a single mutation leading to the aspartate 86 to glycine (D86G) exchange in the essential nucleolar RNA methyltransferase EMG1. EMG1 is required for the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit and is involved in modification of the 18S ribosomal RNA. Here, we identify the pre-ribosomal factors NOP14, NOC4L and UTP14A as members of a nucleolar subcomplex that contains EMG1 and is required for its recruitment to nucleoli. The BCS mutation in EMG1 leads to reduced nucleolar localisation, accumulation of EMG1D86G in nuclear foci and its proteasome-dependent degradation. We further show that EMG1 can be imported into the nucleus by the importins (Imp) Impa/b or Impb/7. Interestingly, in addition to its role in nuclear import, binding of the Impb/7 heterodimer can prevent unspecific aggregation of both EMG1 and EMG1D86G on RNAs in vitro, indicating that the importins act as chaperones by binding to basic regions of the RNA methyltransferase. Our findings further indicate that in BCS, nuclear disassembly of the import complex and release of EMG1D86G lead to its nuclear aggregation and degradation, resulting in the reduced nucleolar recruitment of the RNA methyltransferase and defects in the biogenesis of the small ribosomal subunit.

27807193|t|PTPN22 Is a Critical Regulator of Fcg Receptor-Mediated Neutrophil Activation.
27807193|a|Neutrophils act as a first line of defense against bacterial and fungal infections, but they are also important effectors of acute and chronic inflammation. Genome-wide association studies have established that the gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22 (PTPN22) makes an important contribution to susceptibility to autoimmune disease, notably rheumatoid arthritis. Although PTPN22 is most highly expressed in neutrophils, its function in these cells remains poorly characterized. We show in this article that neutrophil effector functions, including adhesion, production of reactive oxygen species, and degranulation induced by immobilized immune complexes, were reduced in Ptpn22(-/-) neutrophils. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn and Syk was altered in Ptpn22(-/-) neutrophils. On stimulation with immobilized immune complexes, Ptpn22(-/-) neutrophils manifested reduced activation of key signaling intermediates. Ptpn22(-/-) mice were protected from immune complex-mediated arthritis, induced by the transfer of arthritogenic serum. In contrast, in vivo neutrophil recruitment following thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and in vitro chemotaxis were not affected by lack of PTPN22. Our data suggest an important role for PTPN22-dependent dephosphorylation events, which are required to enable full FcgR-induced activation, pointing to an important role for this molecule in neutrophil function.

27825100|t|High glucose repatterns human podocyte energy metabolism during differentiation and diabetic nephropathy.
27825100|a|Podocytes play a key role in diabetic nephropathy pathogenesis, but alteration of their metabolism remains unknown in human kidney. By using a conditionally differentiating human podocyte cell line, we addressed the functional and molecular changes in podocyte energetics during in vitro development or under high glucose conditions. In 5 mM glucose medium, we observed a stepwise activation of oxidative metabolism during cell differentiation that was characterized by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g coactivator 1a (PGC-1a)-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, with concomitant reduction of the glycolytic enzyme content. Conversely, when podocytes were cultured in high glucose (20 mM), stepwise oxidative phosphorylation biogenesis was aborted, and a glycolytic switch occurred, with consecutive lactic acidosis. Expression of the master regulators of oxidative metabolism transcription factor A mitochondrial, PGC-1a, AMPK, and serine-threonine liver kinase B1 was altered by high glucose, as well as their downstream signaling networks. Focused transcriptomics revealed that myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) and myogenic factor 5 (MYF5) expression was inhibited by high glucose levels, and endoribonuclease-prepared small interfering RNA-mediated combined inhibition of those transcription factors phenocopied the glycolytic shift that was observed in high glucose conditions. Accordingly, a reduced expression of MEF2C, MYF5, and PGC-1a was found in kidney tissue sections that were obtained from patients with diabetic nephropathy. These findings obtained in human samples demonstrate that MEF2C-MYF5-dependent bioenergetic dedifferentiation occurs in podocytes that are confronted with a high-glucose milieu.-Imasawa, T., Obre, E., Bellance, N., Lavie, J., Imasawa, T., Rigothier, C., Delmas, Y., Combe, C., Lacombe, D., Benard, G., Claverol, S., Bonneu, M., Rossignol, R.

27840894|t|Seven novel and six de novo PHEX gene mutations in patients with hypophosphatemic rickets.
27840894|a|Inactivating mutations in phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidase on the X chromosome (PHEX) have been identified as a cause of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH; OMIM 307800). In the present study, we enrolled 43 patients from 18 unrelated families clinically diagnosed with hypophosphatemic rickets and 250 healthy controls. For each available individual, all 22 exons with their exon-intron boundaries of the PHEX gene were directly sequenced. The levels of serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) were measured as well. Sequencing analysis detected 17 different PHEX gene mutations, and 7 of these were identified as novel: 3 missense mutations, including c.304G>A (p.Gly102Arg) in exon 3, c.229T>C (p.Cys77Arg) in exon 3 and c.824T>C (p.Leu275Pro) in exon 7; 2 deletion mutations, including c.528delT (p.Glu177LysfsX44) in exon 5 and c.1234delA (p.Ser412ValfsX12) in exon 11; and 2 alternative splicing mutations, including c.436_436+1delAG in intron 4 at splicing donor sites and c.1483-1G>C in intron 13 at splicing acceptor sites. Moreover, 6 mutations were proven to be de novo in 6 sporadic cases and the probands were all females. No mutations were found in the 250 healthy controls. The serum levels of FGF23 varied widely among the patients with XLH, and no significant difference was found when compared with those of the healthy controls. On the whole, the findings of this study provide new insight into the spectrum of PHEX mutations and provide potential evidence of a critical domain in PHEX protein. In addition, the finding of an overlap of the serum FGF23 levels between the patients with XLH and the healthy controls indicates its limited diagnostic value in XLH.

27860187|t|Autophagy activated by tuberin/mTOR/p70S6K suppression is a protective mechanism against local anaesthetics neurotoxicity.
27860187|a|The local anaesthetics (LAs) are widely used for peripheral nerve blocks, epidural anaesthesia, spinal anaesthesia and pain management. However, exposure to LAs for long duration or at high dosage can provoke potential neuronal damages. Autophagy is an intracellular bulk degradation process for proteins and organelles. However, both the effects of LAs on autophagy in neuronal cells and the effects of autophagy on LAs neurotoxicity are not clear. To answer these questions, both lipid LAs (procaine and tetracaine) and amide LAs (bupivacaine, lidocaine and ropivacaine) were administrated to human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Neurotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay, morphological alterations and median death dosage. Autophagic flux was estimated by autolysosome formation (dual fluorescence LC3 assay), LC3-II generation and p62 protein degradation (immunoblotting). Signalling alterations were examined by immunoblotting analysis. Inhibition of autophagy was achieved by transfection with beclin-1 siRNA. We observed that LAs decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The neurotoxicity of LAs was tetracaine > bupivacaine > ropivacaine > procaine > lidocaine. LAs increased autophagic flux, as reflected by increases in autolysosome formation and LC3-II generation, and decrease in p62 levels. Moreover, LAs inhibited tuberin/mTOR/p70S6K signalling, a negative regulator of autophagy activation. Most importantly, autophagy inhibition by beclin-1 knockdown exacerbated the LAs-provoked cell damage. Our data suggest that autophagic flux was up-regulated by LAs through inhibition of tuberin/mTOR/p70S6K signalling, and autophagy activation served as a protective mechanism against LAs neurotoxicity. Therefore, autophagy manipulation could be an alternative therapeutic intervention to prevent LAs-induced neuronal damage.

27860244|t|Role of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in inflammation and migration of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis.
27860244|a|To probe the role of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in regulating inflammation, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). FLSs were separated from synovial tissues (STs) from patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). An inhibitor of PRMT5 (EPZ015666) and short interference RNA (siRNA) against PRMT5 were used to inhibit PRMT5 expression. The standard of protein was measured by Western blot or immunofluorescence. The excretion and genetic expression of inflammatory factors were, respectively, estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Migration and invasion in vitro were detected by Boyden chamber assay. FLSs proliferation was detected by BrdU incorporation. Increased PRMT5 was discovered in STs and FLSs from patients with RA. In RA FLSs, the level of PRMT5 was up-regulated by stimulation with IL-1b and TNF-a. Inhibition of PRMT5 by EPZ015666 and siRNA-mediated knockdown reduced IL-6 and IL-8 production, and proliferation of RA FLSs. In addition, inhibition of PRMT5 decreased in vitro migration and invasion of RA FLSs. Furthermore, EPZ015666 restrained the phosphorylation of IkB kinaseb and IkBa, as well as nucleus transsituation of p65 as well as AKT in FLSs. PRMT5 regulated the production of inflammatory factors, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of RA FLS, which was mediated by the NF-kB and AKT pathways. Our data suggested that targeting PRMT5 to prevent synovial inflammation and destruction might be a promising therapy for RA.

27860245|t|Telocytes: a potential defender in the spleen of Npc1 mutant mice.
27860245|a|Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (Npc1), is an atypical lysosomal storage disorder caused by autosomal recessive inheritance of mutations in Npc1 gene. In the Npc1 mutant mice (Npc1(-/-) ), the initial manifestation is enlarged spleen, concomitant with free cholesterol accumulation. Telocytes (TCs), a novel type of interstitial cell, exist in a variety of tissues including spleen, presumably thought to be involved in many biological processes such as nursing stem cells and recruiting inflammatory cells. In this study, we found that the spleen is significantly enlarged in Npc1(-/-) mice, and the results from transmission electron microscopy examination and immunostaining using three different TCs markers, c-Kit, CD34 and Vimentin revealed significantly increased splenic TCs in Npc1(-/-) mice. Furthermore, hematopoietic stem cells and macrophages were also elevated in Npc1(-/-) spleen. Taken together, our data indicate that splenic TCs might alleviate the progress of splenic malfunction via recruiting hematopoietic stem cells and macrophages.

27863477|t|Keratin 19 as a key molecule in progression of human hepatocellular carcinomas through invasion and angiogenesis.
27863477|a|BACKGROUND: Keratin (K) 19-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is well known to have a higher malignant potential than K19-negative HCC: However, the molecular mechanisms involved in K19-mediated progression of HCC remain unclear. We attempted to clarify whether K19 directly affects cell survival and invasiveness in association with cellular senescence or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in K19-positive HCC. METHODS: K19 expression was analysed in 136 HCC surgical specimens. The relationship of K19 with clinicopathological factors and survival was analysed. Further, the effect of K19 on cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis was examined by silencing K19 in the human HCC cell lines, HepG2, HuH-7, and PLC/PRF/5. Finally, we investigated HCC invasion, proliferation, and angiogenesis using K19-positive HCC specimens. RESULTS: Analysis of HCC surgical specimens revealed that K19-positive HCC exhibited higher invasiveness, metastatic potential, and poorer prognosis. In vitro experiments using the human HCC cell lines revealed that K19 silencing suppressed cell growth by inducting apoptosis or upregulating p16 and p27, resulting in cellular senescence. In addition, transfection with K19 siRNA upregulated E-cadherin gene expression, significantly inhibited the invasive capacity of the cells, downregulated angiogenesis-related molecules such as vasohibin-1 (VASH1) and fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGFR1), and upregulated vasohibin-2 (VASH2). K19-positive HCC specimens exhibited a high MIB-1 labelling index, decreased E-cadherin expression, and high microvessel density around cancer foci. CONCLUSION: K19 directly promotes cancer cell survival, invasion, and angiogenesis, resulting in HCC progression and poor clinical outcome. K19 may therefore be a novel drug target for the treatment of K19-positive HCC.

27863482|t|In silico SNP analysis of the breast cancer antigen NY-BR-1.
27863482|a|BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies with increasing incidences every year and a leading cause of death among women. Although early stage breast cancer can be effectively treated, there are limited numbers of treatment options available for patients with advanced and metastatic disease. The novel breast cancer associated antigen NY-BR-1 was identified by SEREX analysis and is expressed in the majority (>70%) of breast tumors as well as metastases, in normal breast tissue, in testis and occasionally in prostate tissue. The biological function and regulation of NY-BR-1 is up to date unknown. METHODS: We performed an in silico analysis on the genetic variations of the NY-BR-1 gene using data available in public SNP databases and the tools SIFT, Polyphen and Provean to find possible functional SNPs. Additionally, we considered the allele frequency of the found damaging SNPs and also analyzed data from an in-house sequencing project of 55 breast cancer samples for recurring SNPs, recorded in dbSNP. RESULTS: Over 2800 SNPs are recorded in the dbSNP and NHLBI ESP databases for the NY-BR-1 gene. Of these, 65 (2.07%) are synonymous SNPs, 191 (6.09%) are non-synoymous SNPs, and 2430 (77.48%) are noncoding intronic SNPs. As a result, 69 non-synoymous SNPs were predicted to be damaging by at least two, and 16 SNPs were predicted as damaging by all three of the used tools. The SNPs rs200639888, rs367841401 and rs377750885 were categorized as highly damaging by all three tools. Eight damaging SNPs are located in the ankyrin repeat domain (ANK), a domain known for its frequent involvement in protein-protein interactions. No distinctive features could be observed in the allele frequency of the analyzed SNPs. CONCLUSION: Considering these results we expect to gain more insights into the variations of the NY-BR-1 gene and their possible impact on giving rise to splice variants and therefore influence the function of NY-BR-1 in healthy tissue as well as in breast cancer.

27866394|t|Repeated otilonium bromide administration prevents neurotransmitter changes in colon of rats underwent to wrap restraint stress.
27866394|a|Otilonium bromide (OB) is a spasmolytic drug successfully used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Its efficacy has been attributed to the block of L- and T-type Ca(2+) channels and muscarinic and tachykinin receptors in the smooth muscle. Furthermore, in healthy rats, repeated OB administration modified neurotransmitter expression and function suggesting other mechanisms of action. On this basis, we investigated whether repeated OB treatment prevented the functional and neurochemical changes observed in the colon of rats underwent to wrap restrain stress (WRS) a psychosocial stressor considered suitable to reproduce the main IBS signs and symptoms. In control, WRS and OB/WRS rats functional parameters were measured in vivo and morphological investigations were done ex vivo in the colon. The results showed that OB counteracts most of the neurotransmitters changes caused by WRS. In particular, the drug prevents the decrease in SP-, NK1r-, nNOS-, VIP-, and S100b-immunoreactivity (IR) and the increase in CGRP-, and CRF1r-IR. On the contrary, OB does not affect the increase in CRF2r-IR neurons observed in WRS rats and does not interfere with the mild mucosal inflammation due to WRS. Finally, OB per se increases the Mr2 expression in the muscle wall and decreases the number of the myenteric ChAT-IR neurons. Functional findings show a significantly reduction in the number of spontaneous abdominal contraction in OB treated rats. The ability of OB to block L-type Ca(2+) channels, also expressed by enteric neurons, might represent a possible mechanism through which OB exerts its actions.

27903619|t|Interleukin-10-mediated regenerative postnatal tissue repair is dependent on regulation of hyaluronan metabolism via fibroblast-specific STAT3 signaling.
27903619|a|The cytokine IL-10 has potent antifibrotic effects in models of adult fibrosis, but the mechanisms of action are unclear. Here, we report a novel finding that IL-10 triggers a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent signaling pathway that regulates hyaluronan (HA) metabolism and drives adult fibroblasts to synthesize an HA-rich pericellular matrix, which mimics the fetal regenerative wound healing phenotype with reduced fibrosis. By using cre-lox-mediated novel, inducible, fibroblast-, keratinocyte-, and wound-specific STAT3 knockdown postnatal mice-plus syngeneic fibroblast cell-transplant models-we demonstrate that the regenerative effects of IL-10 in postnatal wounds are dependent on HA synthesis and fibroblast-specific STAT3-dependent signaling. The importance of IL-10-induced HA synthesis for regenerative wound healing is demonstrated by inhibition of HA synthesis in a murine wound model by administering 4-methylumbelliferone. Although IL-10 and STAT3 signaling were intact, the antifibrotic repair phenotype that is induced by IL-10 overexpression was abrogated in this model. Our data show a novel role for IL-10 beyond its accepted immune-regulatory mechanism. The opportunity for IL-10 to regulate a fibroblast-specific formation of a regenerative, HA-rich wound extracellular matrix may lead to the development of innovative therapies to attenuate postnatal fibrosis in organ systems or diseases in which dysregulated inflammation and HA intersect.-Balaji, S., Wang, X., King, A., Le, L.

27914199|t|Filamin, a synaptic organizer in Drosophila, determines glutamate receptor composition and membrane growth.
27914199|a|Filamin is a scaffolding protein that functions in many cells as an actin-crosslinker. FLN90, an isoform of the Drosophila ortholog Filamin/cheerio that lacks the actin-binding domain, is here shown to govern the growth of postsynaptic membrane folds and the composition of glutamate receptor clusters at the larval neuromuscular junction. Genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that FLN90 is present surrounding synaptic boutons. FLN90 is required in the muscle for localization of the kinase dPak and, downstream of dPak, for localization of the GTPase Ral and the exocyst complex to this region. Consequently, Filamin is needed for growth of the subsynaptic reticulum. In addition, in the absence of filamin, type-A glutamate receptor subunits are lacking at the postsynapse, while type-B subunits cluster correctly. Receptor composition is dependent on dPak, but independent of the Ral pathway. Thus two major aspects of synapse formation, morphological plasticity and subtype-specific receptor clustering, require postsynaptic Filamin.

27943262|t|Contribution of upregulated dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) in promoting tumoregenicity, metastasis and the prediction of poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
27943262|a|Dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) is encoded by DPP9, which belongs to the DPP4 gene family. Proteins encoded by these genes have unique peptidase and extra-enzymatic functions that have been linked to various diseases including cancers. Here, we describe the expression pattern and biological function of DPP9 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The repression of DPP9 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, we explored the role of DPP9 in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The epithelial markers E-cadherin and MUC1 were significantly increased, while mesenchymal markers vimentin and S100A4 were markedly decreased in DPP9 knockdown cells. The downregulation of DPP9 in the NSCLC cells induced the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins both in vitro and in vivo. We investigated the protein expression levels of DPP9 by tissue microarray immunohistochemical assay (TMA-IHC) (n = 217). Further we found mRNA expression levels of DPP9 in 30 pairs of clinical NSCLC tissues were significantly lower than in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Survival analysis showed that the overexpression of DPP9 was a significant independent factor for poor 5-year overall survival in patients with NSCLC (p = 0.003). Taken together, DPP9 expression correlates with poor overall survival in NSCLC.

27959387|t|Long-term exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to ethanol stimulates oncogenic features.
27959387|a|Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer. Little is known regarding the mechanism, although it is assumed that acetaldehyde or estrogen mediated pathways play a role. We previously showed that long-term exposure to 2.5 mM ethanol (blood alcohol ~0.012%) of MCF-12A, a human normal epithelial breast cell line, induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oncogenic transformation. In this study, we investigated in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, whether a similar exposure to ethanol at concentrations ranging up to peak blood levels in heavy drinkers would increase malignant progression. Short-term (1-week) incubation to ethanol at as low as 1-5 mM (corresponding to blood alcohol concentration of ~0.0048-0.024%) upregulated the stem cell related proteins Oct4 and Nanog, but they were reduced after exposure at 25 mM. Long-term (4-week) exposure to 25 mM ethanol upregulated the Oct4 and Nanog proteins, as well as the malignancy marker Ceacam6. DNA microarray analysis in cells exposed for 1 week showed upregulated expression of metallothionein genes, particularly MT1X. Long-term exposure upregulated expression of some malignancy related genes (STEAP4, SERPINA3, SAMD9, GDF15, KRT15, ITGB6, TP63, and PGR, as well as the CEACAM, interferon related, and HLA gene families). Some of these findings were validated by RT-PCR. A similar treatment also modulated numerous microRNAs (miRs) including one regulator of Oct4 as well as miRs involved in oncogenesis and/or malignancy, with only a few estrogen-induced miRs. Long-term 25 mM ethanol also induced a 5.6-fold upregulation of anchorage-independent growth, an indicator of malignant-like features. Exposure to acetaldehyde resulted in little or no effect comparable to that of ethanol. The previously shown alcohol induction of oncogenic transformation of normal breast cells is now complemented by the current results suggesting alcohol's potential involvement in malignant progression of breast cancer.

27993978|t|CenpH regulates meiotic G2/M transition by modulating the APC/CCdh1-cyclin B1 pathway in oocytes.
27993978|a|Meiotic resumption (G2/M transition) and progression through meiosis I (MI) are two key stages for producing fertilization-competent eggs. Here, we report that CenpH, a component of the kinetochore inner plate, is responsible for G2/M transition in meiotic mouse oocytes. Depletion of CenpH by morpholino injection decreased cyclin B1 levels, resulting in attenuation of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activation, and severely compromised meiotic resumption. CenpH protects cyclin B1 from destruction by competing with the action of APC/C(Cdh1) Impaired G2/M transition after CenpH depletion could be rescued by expression of exogenous cyclin B1. Unexpectedly, blocking CenpH did not affect spindle organization and meiotic cell cycle progression after germinal vesicle breakdown. Our findings reveal a novel role of CenpH in regulating meiotic G2/M transition by acting via the APC/C(Cdh1)-cyclin B1 pathway.

27999109|t|A Critical Role for the Type I Interferon Receptor in Virus-Induced Autoimmune Diabetes in Rats.
27999109|a|The pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes, characterized by immune-mediated damage of insulin-producing b-cells of pancreatic islets, may involve viral infection. Essential components of the innate immune antiviral response, including type I interferon (IFN) and IFN receptor-mediated signaling pathways, are candidates for determining susceptibility to human type 1 diabetes. Numerous aspects of human type 1 diabetes pathogenesis are recapitulated in the LEW.1WR1 rat model. Diabetes can be induced in LEW.1WR1 weanling rats challenged with virus or with the viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). We hypothesized that disrupting the cognate type I IFN receptor (type I IFN a/b receptor [IFNAR]) to interrupt IFN signaling would prevent or delay the development of virus-induced diabetes. We generated IFNAR1 subunit-deficient LEW.1WR1 rats using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9) genome editing and confirmed functional disruption of the Ifnar1 gene. IFNAR1 deficiency significantly delayed the onset and frequency of diabetes and greatly reduced the intensity of insulitis after poly I:C treatment. The occurrence of Kilham rat virus-induced diabetes was also diminished in IFNAR1-deficient animals. These findings firmly establish that alterations in innate immunity influence the course of autoimmune diabetes and support the use of targeted strategies to limit or prevent the development of type 1 diabetes.

28049521|t|Analysis of cellular and molecular antitumor effects upon inhibition of SATB1 in glioblastoma cells.
28049521|a|BACKGROUND: The Special AT-rich Sequence Binding Protein 1 (SATB1) regulates the expression of many genes by acting as a global chromatin organizer. While in many tumor entities SATB1 overexpression has been observed and connected to pro-tumorigenic processes, somewhat contradictory evidence exists in brain tumors with regard to SATB1 overexpression in glioblastoma and its association with poorer prognosis and tumor progression. On the functional side, initial data indicate that SATB1 may be involved in several tumor cell-relevant processes. METHODS: For the detailed analysis of the functional relevance and possible therapeutic potential of SATB1 inhibition, we employ transient siRNA-mediated knockdown and comprehensively analyze the cellular and molecular role of SATB1 in glioblastoma. RESULTS: In various cell lines with different SATB1 expression levels, a SATB1 gene dose-dependent inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent proliferation is observed. This is due to cell cycle-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of SATB1 knockdown. Molecular analyses reveal SATB1 knockdown effects on multiple important (proto-) oncogenes, including Myc, Bcl-2, Pim-1, EGFR, b-catenin and Survivin. Molecules involved in cell cycle, EMT and cell adhesion are affected as well. The putative therapeutic relevance of SATB1 inhibition is further supported in an in vivo tumor xenograft mouse model, where the treatment with polymeric nanoparticles containing SATB1-specific siRNAs exerts antitumor effects. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that SATB1 may represent a promising target molecule in glioblastoma therapy whose inhibition or knockdown affects multiple crucial pathways.

28068934|t|Concordance between PIK3CA mutations in endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
28068934|a|BACKGROUND: PIK3CA mutations are expected to be potential therapeutic targets for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We aimed to clarify the concordance between PIK3CA mutations detected in endoscopic biopsy specimens and corresponding surgically resected specimens. METHODS: We examined five hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene (E542K, E545K, E546K, H1047R, and H1047L) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of paired endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from 181 patients undergoing curative resection for ESCC between 2000 and 2011 using a Luminex technology-based multiplex gene mutation detection kit. RESULTS: Mutation analyses were successfully performed for both endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens in all the cases. A PIK3CA mutation was detected in either type of specimen in 13 cases (7.2%, 95% confidence interval: 3.9-12.0). The overall concordance rate, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.3% (178/181), 90.9% (10/11), and 98.8% (168/170), respectively. Among patients with a PIK3CA mutation detected in both types of specimens, the concordance between PIK3CA mutation genotypes was 100%. There were three cases with a discordant mutation status between the types of specimens (PIK3CA mutation in surgically resected specimen and wild-type in biopsy specimen in two cases, and the opposite pattern in one case), suggesting possible intratumoral heterogeneity in the PIK3CA mutation status. CONCLUSIONS: The PIK3CA mutation status was highly concordant between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from the same patient, suggesting that endoscopic biopsy specimens can be clinically used to detect PIK3CA mutations in patients with ESCC.

28068936|t|Retrospective study of RAS/PIK3CA/BRAF tumor mutations as predictors of response to first-line chemotherapy with bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.
28068936|a|BACKGROUND: After analysis of minor RAS mutations (KRAS exon 3, 4/NRAS) in the FIRE-3 and PRIME studies, an expanded range of RAS mutations were established as a negative predictive marker for the efficacy of anti-EGFR antibody treatment. BRAF and PIK3CA mutations may be candidate biomarkers for anti-EGFR targeted therapies. However, it remains unknown whether RAS/PIK3CA/BRAF tumor mutations can predict the efficacy of bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer. We assessed whether selection according to RAS/PIK3CA/BRAF mutational status could be beneficial for patients treated with bevacizumab as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: Of the 1001 consecutive colorectal cancer patients examined for RAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF tumor mutations using a multiplex kit (LuminexR), we studied 90 patients who received combination chemotherapy with bevacizumab as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. The objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated according to mutational status. RESULTS: The ORR was higher among patients with wild-type tumors (64.3%) compared to those with tumors that were only wild type with respect to KRAS exon 2 (54.8%), and the differences in ORR between patients with wild-type and mutant-type tumors were greater when considering only KRAS exon 2 mutations (6.8%) rather than RAS/PIK3CA/BRAF mutations (18.4%). There were no statistically significant differences in ORR or PFS between all wild-type tumors and tumors carrying any of the mutations. Multivariate analysis revealed that liver metastasis and RAS and BRAF mutations were independent negative factors for disease progression after first-line treatment with bevacizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Patient selection according to RAS/PIK3CA/BRAF mutations could help select patients who will achieve a better response to bevacizumab treatment. We found no clinical benefit of restricting combination therapy with bevacizumab for metastatic colorectal cancer patients with EGFR-wild type tumors.

28082458|t|Developmental Role of Macrophage Cannabinoid-1 Receptor Signaling in Type-2 Diabetes.
28082458|a|Islet inflammation promotes b-cell loss and type-2 diabetes (T2D), a process replicated in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats in which b-cell loss has been linked to cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R)-induced pro-inflammatory signaling in macrophages infiltrating pancreatic islets. Here, we analyzed CB1R signaling in macrophages and its developmental role in T2Da. ZDF rats with global deletion of CB1R are protected from b-cell loss, hyperglycemia and nephropathy present in ZDF littermates. Adoptive transfer of CB1R(-/-) bone marrow to ZDF rats also prevents b-cell loss and hyperglycemia, but not nephropathy. ZDF islets contain elevated levels of CB1R, IL-1b, TNF-a, the chemokine CCL2 and interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF5), a marker of M1 inflammatory macrophage polarization. In primary cultured rodent and human macrophages, CB1R activation increased Irf5 expression, whereas knockdown of Irf5 blunted CB1R-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines without affecting CCL2 expression, which was p38MAPKa-dependent. Macrophage-specific in vivo knockdown of Irf5 protected ZDF rats from b-cell loss and hyperglycemia. Thus, IRF5 is a crucial downstream mediator of diabetogenic CB1R signaling in macrophages and a potential therapeutic target.

28098423|t|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction through activating Akt signalling in rats.
28098423|a|The clinical application of doxorubicin (Dox) is limited by its adverse effect of cardiotoxicity. Previous studies have suggested the cardioprotective effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We hypothesize that BDNF could protect against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. Sprague Dawley rats were injected with Dox (2.5 mg/kg, 3 times/week, i.p.), in the presence or absence of recombinant BDNF (0.4 ug/kg, i.v.) for 2 weeks. H9c2 cells were treated with Dox (1 uM) and/or BDNF (400 ng/ml) for 24 hrs. Functional roles of BDNF against Dox-induced cardiac injury were examined both in vivo and in vitro. Protein level of BDNF was reduced in Dox-treated rat ventricles, whereas BDNF and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) were markedly up-regulated after BDNF administration. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor significantly inhibited Dox-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, oxidative stress and cardiac dysfunction in rats. Meanwhile, BDNF increased cell viability, inhibited apoptosis and DNA damage of Dox-treated H9c2 cells. Investigations of the underlying mechanisms revealed that BDNF activated Akt and preserved phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin and Bad without affecting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular regulated protein kinase pathways. Furthermore, the beneficial effect of BDNF was abolished by BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc or Akt inhibitor. In conclusion, our findings reveal a potent protective role of BDNF against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity by activating Akt signalling, which may facilitate the safe use of Dox in cancer treatment.

28101578|t|A 22q11.2 amplification in the region encoding microRNA-650 correlates with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer primary cultures of Mexican patients.
28101578|a|Breast cancer ranks first in incidence and mortality in working age women. Cancer initiation and progression relies on accumulation of genetic and epigenetic aberrations that alter cellular processes, among them, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) denotes particularly aggressive neoplasias given its capacity to invade and metastasize. Several microRNAs (miRNA) have been found able to regulate gene expression at the core of EMT. In this study, the Affymetrix CytoScan HD array was used to analyze three different primary tumor cell isolates from Mexican breast cancer patients. We found an amplification in band 22q11.2 shared by the three samples, in the region that encodes miRNA-650. Overexpression of this miRNA has been associated with downregulation of tumor suppressors ING4 and NDRG2, which have been implicated in cancer progression. Using the Pathway Linker platform the ING4 and NDRG2 interaction networks showed a significant association with signaling pathways commonly deregulated in cancer. Also, several studies support their participation in the EMT. Supporting the latter, we found that the three primary isolates were E-cadherin negative, vimentin positive, presented a cancer stem cell-like phenotype CD44+CD24-/low and were invasive in Transwell invasion assays. This evidence suggests that the gain of region 22q11.2 contributes to trigger EMT. This is the first evidence linking miR-650 and breast cancer.

28112366|t|Interference with Tim-3 protein expression attenuates the invasion of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and aggravates anoikis.
28112366|a|Tumor cells resistant to anoikis are considered to be candidates for metastasis. In the present study, the role of Tim-3 in anoikis and its influence on the invasion of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) was investigated. Here, polyhydroxylethylmethacrylate (poly-HEMA) was applied to two ccRCC cell lines, 786-O and Caki-2, to induce detachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM). Tim-3 mRNA and protein expression levels were assayed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot, respectively. Anoikis was measured by Ho33342/PI double staining, acridine orange staining, and further determined using the CytoSelect  24-well Anoikis Assay kit. Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry, E-cadherin and N-cadherin protein expression were determined using western blotting and a Chemicon cell invasion assay kit was used to quantify the invasive capacity of 786-O and Caki-2 cells. It was demonstrated that detachment from the ECM decreases transcription and the protein expression level of Tim-3 in 786-O and Caki-2 cells compared with control cells. Interference with Tim-3 expression using small interfering RNA exacerbated anoikis in 786-O and Caki-2 cells induced by poly-HEMA treatment. E-cadherin upregulation, N-cadherin downregulation, and ECM detachment-induced reduction in invasion ability were all exacerbated by knockdown of Tim-3. In conclusion, interference with Tim-3 expression may attenuate the invasion of renal cell carcinoma by aggravating anoikis, indicating Tim-3 as a potential therapeutic target for treating ccRCC.

28112376|t|Increased frequency of peripheral blood follicular helper T cells and elevated serum IL-21 levels in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
28112376|a|An aberrant immune response has been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). However, the role of peripheral blood follicular helper T (TFH) cells in the pathogenesis of OA has yet to be elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of TFH cells and serum interleukin-21 (IL-21) in the pathogenesis of OA. Frequency of peripheral blood inducible costimulator (ICOS)+, programmed death 1 (PD-1)+, and IL-21+ CXCR5+CD4+ T cells in 40 patients with OA and 13 healthy controls (HCs) were examined by flow cytometry. The disease state in individual patients was assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Concentrations of serum IL-21, interferon-g (INF-g), IL-4, IL-17A, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was measured. The percentages of CXCR5+CD4+ cells, PD-1+CXCR5+CD4+, ICOS+CXCR5+CD4+ and IL-21+CXCR5+CD4+ T cells in OA patients were signifcantly higher than those in the HCs. Furthermore, serum IL-21, IL-17A and IFN-g levels in OA patients were significantly higher than those in HCs. Expression of IL-21+TFH cells in OA patients demonstrated a positive correlation with OA disease activity, CRP levels and WOMAC. TFH cells and IL-21 appear to serve an important role in the progression of OA. IL-21+TFH cells may prove to be a marker of OA disease activity.

28115395|t|Syntaxin 2 Acts as Inhibitory SNARE for Insulin Granule Exocytosis.
28115395|a|Of the four syntaxins (Syns) specialized for exocytosis, syntaxin-2 is the least understood. Here, we employed syntaxin-2/epimorphin knockout (KO) mice to examine the role of syntaxin-2 in insulin secretory granule (SG) exocytosis. Unexpectedly, syntaxin-2 KO mice exhibited paradoxical superior glucose homeostasis resulting from an enhanced insulin secretion. This was confirmed in vitro by pancreatic islet perifusion showing an amplified biphasic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) arising from an increase in size of the readily-releasable pool of insulin SGs and enhanced SG pool refilling. The increase in insulin exocytosis was attributed mainly from an enhanced recruitment of the larger pool of newcomer SGs that undergoes no residence time on plasma membrane before fusion, and to lesser extent also the predocked SGs. Consistently, syntaxin-2 depletion resulted in stimulation-induced increase in abundance of exocytotic complexes we previous demonstrated to mediate the fusion of newcomer SGs (Syn-3/VAMP8/SNAP25/Munc18b) and predocked SGs (Syn-1A/VAMP2/SNAP25/Muncn18a). This work is first to show in mammals that syntaxin-2 could function as inhibitory SNARE protein, which when relieved, could promote exocytosis in pancreatic islet b-cells. Thus, syntaxin-2 may serve as a potential target to treat diabetes.

28138708|t|Effect of ART1 on the proliferation and migration of mouse colon carcinoma CT26 cells in vivo.
28138708|a|Arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase 1 (ART1) is an important enzyme that catalyzes arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosylation. There is evidence that arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosylation may affect the proliferation of smooth muscle cells via the Rho-dependent signaling pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated that ART1 may have a role in the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of colon carcinoma in vitro. However, the effect of ART1 on the proliferation and invasion of colon carcinoma in vivo has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, mouse colon carcinoma CT26 cells were infected with a lentivirus to produce ART1 gene silencing or overexpression, and were then subcutaneously transplanted. To observe the effect of ART1 on tumor growth or liver metastasis in vivo, a spleen transplant tumor model of CT26 cells in BALB/c mice was successfully constructed. Expression levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and the downstream factors, c-myc, c-fos and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) proteins, were measured in vivo. The results demonstrated that ART1 gene silencing inhibited the growth of the spleen transplanted tumor and its ability to spread to the liver via metastasis. There was also an accompanying increase in expression of FAK, RhoA, c-myc, c-fos and COX-2, whereas CT26 cells with ART1 overexpression demonstrated the opposite effect. These results suggest a potential role for ART1 in the proliferation and invasion of CT26 cells and a possible mechanism in vivo.

28148261|t|Dclk1, a tumor stem cell marker, regulates pro-survival signaling and self-renewal of intestinal tumor cells.
28148261|a|BACKGROUND: More than 80% of intestinal neoplasia is associated with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (Dclk1), a kinase protein, is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and specifically marks tumor stem cells (TSCs) that self-renew and increased the tumor progeny in Apc (Min/+) mice. However, the role of Dclk1 expression and its contribution to regulating pro-survival signaling for tumor progression in Apc mutant cancer is poorly understood. METHODS: We analyzed DCLK1 and pro-survival signaling gene expression datasets of 329 specimens from TCGA Colon Adenocarcinoma Cancer Data. The network of DCLK1 and pro-survival signaling was analyzed utilizing the GeneMANIA database. We examined the expression levels of Dclk1 and other stem cell-associated markers, pro-survival signaling pathways, cell self-renewal in the isolated intestinal epithelial cells of Apc (Min/+) mice with high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. To determine the functional role of Dclk1 for tumor progression, we knocked down Dclk1 and determined the pro-survival signaling pathways and stemness. We used siRNA technology to gene silence pro-survival signaling in colon cancer cells in vitro. We utilized FACS, IHC, western blot, RT-PCR, and clonogenic (self-renewal) assays. RESULTS: We found a correlation between DCLK1 and pro-survival signaling expression. The expression of Dclk1 and stem cell-associated markers Lgr5, Bmi1, and Musashi1 were significantly higher in the intestinal epithelial cells of Apc (Min/+) mice than in wild-type controls. Intestinal epithelial cells of Apc (Min/+) mice showed increased expression of pro-survival signaling, pluripotency and self-renewal ability. Furthermore, the enteroids formed from the intestinal Dclk1(+) cells of Apc (Min/+) mice display higher pluripotency and pro-survival signaling. Dclk1 knockdown in Apc (Min/+) mice attenuates intestinal adenomas and adenocarcinoma, and decreases pro-survival signaling and self-renewal. Knocking down RELA and NOTCH1 pro-survival signaling and DCLK1 in HT29 and DLD1 colon cancer cells in vitro reduced the tumor cells' ability to self-renew and survive. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that Dclk1 is essential in advancing intestinal tumorigenesis. Knocking down Dclk1 decreases tumor stemness and progression and is thus predicted to regulate pro-survival signaling and tumor cell pluripotency. This study provides a strong rationale to target Dclk1 as a treatment strategy for colorectal cancer.

28148288|t|Metalloprotease-disintegrin ADAM12 actively promotes the stem cell-like phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer.
28148288|a|BACKGROUND: ADAM12 is upregulated in human breast cancers and is a predictor of chemoresistance in estrogen receptor-negative tumors. ADAM12 is induced during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a feature associated with claudin-low breast tumors, which are enriched in cancer stem cell (CSC) markers. It is currently unknown whether ADAM12 plays an active role in promoting the CSC phenotype in breast cancer cells. METHODS: ADAM12 expression was downregulated in representative claudin-low breast cancer cell lines, SUM159PT and Hs578T, using siRNA transfection or inducible shRNA expression. Cell characteristics commonly associated with the CSC phenotype in vitro (cell migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, mammosphere formation, ALDH activity, and expression of the CD44 and CD24 cell surface markers) and in vivo (tumor formation in mice using limiting dilution transplantation assays) were evaluated. RNA sequencing was performed to identify global gene expression changes after ADAM12 knockdown. RESULTS: We found that sorted SUM159PT cell populations with high ADAM12 levels had elevated expression of CSC markers and an increased ability to form mammospheres. ADAM12 knockdown reduced cell migration and invasion, decreased anoikis resistance, and compromised mammosphere formation. ADAM12 knockdown also diminished ALDEFLUOR(+) and CD44(hi)/CD24(-/lo) CSC-enriched populations in vitro and reduced tumorigenesis in mice in vivo. RNA sequencing identified a significant overlap between ADAM12- and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-regulated genes. Consequently, ADAM12 knockdown lowered the basal activation level of EGFR, and this effect was abolished by batimastat, a metalloproteinase inhibitor. Furthermore, incubation of cells with exogenously added EGF prevented the downregulation of CD44(hi)/CD24(-/lo) cell population by ADAM12 knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ADAM12 actively supports the CSC phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer cells via modulation of the EGFR pathway.

28151486|t|Star-PAP, a poly(A) polymerase, functions as a tumor suppressor in an orthotopic human breast cancer model.
28151486|a|Star-PAP is a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase and required for the expression of a select set of mRNAs. However, the pathological role of Star-PAP in cancer largely remains unknown. In this study, we observed decreased expression of Star-PAP in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. Ectopic Star-PAP expression inhibited proliferation as well as colony-forming ability of breast cancer cells. In breast cancer patients, high levels of Star-PAP correlated with an improved prognosis. Moreover, by regulating the expression of BIK (BCL2-interacting killer), Star-PAP induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway. The growth of breast cancer xenografts in NOD/SCID mice was also inhibited by the doxycycline-induced Star-PAP overexpression. Furthermore, Star-PAP sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs both in vitro and in vivo. In mammary epithelial cells, Star-PAP knockdown partially transformed these cells and induced them to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These findings suggested that Star-PAP possesses tumor-suppressing activity and can be a valuable target for developing new cancer therapeutic strategies.

28178994|t|Doxycycline attenuates breast cancer related inflammation by decreasing plasma lysophosphatidate concentrations and inhibiting NF-kB activation.
28178994|a|BACKGROUND: We previously discovered that tetracyclines increase the expression of lipid phosphate phosphatases at the surface of cells. These enzymes degrade circulating lysophosphatidate and therefore doxycycline increases the turnover of plasma lysophosphatidate and decreases its concentration. Extracellular lysophosphatidate signals through six G protein-coupled receptors and it is a potent promoter of tumor growth, metastasis and chemo-resistance. These effects depend partly on the stimulation of inflammation that lysophosphatidate produces. METHODS: In this work, we used a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer to determine the impact of doxycycline on circulating lysophosphatidate concentrations and tumor growth. Cytokine/chemokine concentrations in tumor tissue and plasma were measured by multiplexing laser bead technology. Leukocyte infiltration in tumors was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression of IL-6 in breast cancer cell lines was determined by RT-PCR. Cell growth was measured in Matrigel  3D culture. The effects of doxycycline on NF-kB-dependent signaling were analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Doxycycline decreased plasma lysophosphatidate concentrations, delayed tumor growth and decreased the concentrations of several cytokines/chemokines (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-9, CCL2, CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, G-CSF, LIF, VEGF) in the tumor. These results were compatible with the effects of doxycycline in decreasing the numbers of F4/80(+) macrophages and CD31(+) blood vessel endothelial cells in the tumor. Doxycycline also decreased the lysophosphatidate-induced growth of breast cancer cells in three-dimensional culture. Lysophosphatidate-induced Ki-67 expression was inhibited by doxycycline. NF-kB activity in HEK293 cells transiently expressing a NF-kB-luciferase reporter vectors was also inhibited by doxycycline. Treatment of breast cancer cells with doxycycline also decreased the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus and the mRNA levels for IL-6 in the presence or absence of lysophosphatidate. CONCLUSION: These results contribute a new dimension for understanding the anti-inflammatory effects of tetracyclines, which make them potential candidates for adjuvant therapy of cancers and other inflammatory diseases.

28182011|t|TAK1 regulates resident macrophages by protecting lysosomal integrity.
28182011|a|Hematopoietic cell survival and death is critical for development of a functional immune system. Here, we report that a protein kinase, TAK1, is selectively required for resident macrophage integrity during embryogenesis. Hematopoietic lineage-specific deletion of Tak1 gene (Tak1(HKO)) caused accumulation of cellular debris in the thymus in perinatal mice. Although no overt alteration in thymocytes and blood myeloid populations was observed in Tak1(HKO) mice, we found that thymic and lung macrophages were diminished. In the in vitro setting, Tak1 deficiency caused profound disruption of lysosomes and killed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) without any exogenous stressors. Inhibition of the lysosomal protease, cathepsin B, partially blocked Tak1-deficient BMDM death, suggesting that leakage of the lysosomal contents is in part the cause of cell death. To identify the trigger of this cell death, we examined involvement of TNF and Toll-like receptor pathways. Among them, we found that deletion of Tnfr1 partially rescued cell death. Finally, we show that Tnfr1 deletion partially restored thymic and lung macrophages in vivo. These results suggest that autocrine and potentially paracrine TNF kills Tak1-deficient macrophages during development. Our results reveal that TAK1 signaling maintains proper macrophage populations through protecting lysosomal integrity.

28202687|t|Oxidized phagosomal NOX2 is replenished from lysosomes.
28202687|a|In dendritic cells, the NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) is recruited to the phagosomal membrane during antigen uptake. NOX2 produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the lumen of the phagosome which kill ingested pathogens, delay antigen breakdown and alter the peptide repertoire for presentation to T cells. How the integral membrane component of NOX2, cytochrome b558, traffics to phagosomes is incompletely understood. In this study, we show in dendritic cells derived from human blood-isolated monocytes that cytochrome b558 is initially recruited to the phagosome from the plasma membrane during phagosome formation. Cytochrome b558 also traffics from a lysosomal pool to phagosomes and this is required to replenish oxidatively damaged NOX2. We identified syntaxin-7, SNAP23 and VAMP8 as the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins mediating this process. Our data describe a key mechanism of how dendritic cells sustain ROS production after antigen uptake required to initiate T cell responses.

28204828|t|TIEG1 deficiency confers enhanced myocardial protection in the infarcted heart by mediating the Pten/Akt signalling pathway.
28204828|a|The transforming growth factor (TGF)-b-inducible early gene-1 (TIEG1) plays a crucial role in modulating cell apoptosis and proliferation in a number of diseases, including pancreatic cancer, leukaemia and osteoporosis. However, the functional role of TIEG1 in the heart has not been fully defined. In this study, we first investigated the role of TIEG1 in ischaemic heart disease. For in vitro experiments, cardiomyocytes were isolated from both TIEG1 knockout (KO) and wile-type (WT) mice, and the apoptotic ratios were evaluated after a 48-h ischaemic insult. A cell proliferation assay was performed after 7 days of incubation under normoxic conditions. In addition, the angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells was determined by tube formation assay. For in vivo experiments, a model of myocardial infarction (MI) was established using both TIEG1 KO and WT mice. Echocardiography was performed at 3 and 28 days post-MI, whereas the haemodynamics test was performed 28 days post-MI. Histological analyses of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis and infarct zone assessments were performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining, BrdU immunostaining, a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)/CD31 immunostaining and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. Changes in the expression of related proteins caused by TIEG1 deficiency were confirmed using both reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that the absence of TIEG1 prevented cardiomyocytes from undergoing apoptosis and promoted higher proliferation; it stimulated the proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Improved cardiac function and less scar formation were observed in TIEG1 KO mice, and we also observed the altered expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), Akt and Bcl-2/Bax, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). On the whole, our findings indicate that the absence of TIEG1 plays a cardioprotective role in ischaemic heart disease by promoting changes in Pten/Akt signalling.

28228553|t|The novel mitochondrial matrix protease Ste23 is required for efficient presequence degradation and processing.
28228553|a|Around 70% of mitochondrial precursor proteins are imported from the cytosol via N-terminal presequences, which are cleaved upon exposure to the mitochondrial processing protease MPP in the matrix. Cleaved presequence peptides then need to be efficiently degraded and impairment of this clearance step e.g. by amyloid beta peptides causes a feedback inhibition of MPP leading ultimately to accumulation of immature precursor proteins within mitochondria. Degradation of mitochondrial peptides is performed by Cym1 in yeast and its homolog PreP in humans. Here we identify the novel mitochondrial matrix protease Ste23 in yeast, a homolog of human insulin degrading enzyme, which is required for efficient peptide degradation. Ste23 and Cym1 tightly cooperate to ensure the correct functioning of the essential presequence processing machinery.

28230861|t|RIPK3 interactions with MLKL and CaMKII mediate oligodendrocytes death in the developing brain.
28230861|a|Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) death is a key contributor to cerebral white matter injury (WMI) in the developing brain. A previous study by our group indicated that receptor-interacting proteins (RIPs) are crucial in mediating necroptosis in developing neurons. However, whether this mechanism is involved in OPCs death is unclear. We aimed to explore the mechanisms of RIP-mediated oligodendrocytes (OLs) death in the developing brain. Oligodendrocytes necroptosis was induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation plus caspase inhibitor zVAD treatment (OGD/zVAD) in vitro. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to detect RIPK1, RIPK3, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), and Ca(2+) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IId (CaMKIId). Immunoprecipitation was used to assess the interactions between RIPK3 and RIPK1, MLKL, and CaMKIId. Necrostatin-1 was used to disturb the RIPK3-RIPK1 interaction, and siRNA was used to inhibit RIPK3 or MLKL expression. Oligodendrocytes death was examined using PI staining, EM, and cell membrane leakage assays. In vivo, brain damage in neonatal rats was induced by hypoxia-ischemia (HI). This was followed by an examination of myelin development. We found that OGD/zVAD treatment upregulates the expression of RIPK3 and the interaction of RIPK3 with RIPK1, MLKL, and CaMKIId. Inhibition of the RIPK3-MLKL or RIPK3-CaMKIId interaction attenuates OLs death induced by OGD/zVAD. These protective mechanisms involve the translocation of MLKL to the OLs membrane, and the phosphorylation of CaMKIId. However, inhibition of the RIPK3-RIPK1 interaction did not protect OLs death induced by OGD/zVAD. In vivo studies indicated that the disrupted development of myelin was attenuated after the inhibition of RIPK3-MLKL or RIPK3-CaMKIId interaction. Taken together, our data indicate that RIPK3 is a key factor in protection against OLs death and abnormal myelin development via its interaction with MLKL and CaMKIId after HI. This suggests that RIPK3 may be a potential target for the treatment of WMI in neonates.

28259923|t|Pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition via Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway in human colorectal adenocarcinoma.
28259923|a|Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step in the acquisition of metastatic and invasive power for tumor cells. Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) is a common cancer where metastasis is directly linked to patient survival. Recent studies show that pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2 (PLAGL2) could induce tumor EMT and is an independent predictive factor associated with poor prognosis in cancer. In the present study, we confirmed the role of PLAGL2 in the prognosis of CRC patients and provide molecular evidence of PLAGL2 promoted EMT in CRC cell line SW480. We found that PLAGL2 expression was upregulated in the paraffin-embedded CRC tissues compared to borderline or benign tissues. Experimental EMT induced by PLAGL2 plasmid transfection proved PLAGL2 protein overexpression could enhance the cell scratch wound-healing and transwell ability and significantly upregulated mesenchymal marker proteins, N-cadherin and vimentin and concurrently downregulated epithelial marker of E-cadherin. Subsequently, through western blot assay, we found that PLAGL2 could activate the wnt-signaling component b-catenin in the nuclei. More CRC cell metastasis to the lungs was observed when the PLAGL2 overexpressing SW480 cells were injected into the tail vein of rats, compared with the cell control and PLAGL2 silence group. Our findings indicated that PLAGL2 might be a very upstream key molecule regulating EMT involved in Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway.

28259936|t|The tripartite motif-containing protein 3 on the proliferation and cytokine secretion of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes.
28259936|a|Recent studies have revealed fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) as a pivotal effector cell in the inflamed joint of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. FLS exhibit high proliferation rates and constitutive expression of cytokines, contributing to the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, we found that the expression of tripartite motif-containing protein 3 (TRIM3), a candidate tumor suppressor gene, was lower in synovial tissue samples of RA patients than in that of healthy controls. We then investigated the role of TRIM3 on the proliferation and cytokine secretion of primary cultured FLS from RA patients. Enforced expression of TRIM3 in RA FLS led to significantly decreased cell proliferation as indicated by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, reduced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6 as indicated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and decreased p38 phosphorylation as assessed by western blot analysis. The proteins promoting cell cycles (cyclin D1 and PCNA) were downregulated and the protein negatively regulating cell cycle progression (p53 and p21) was upregulated after TRIM3 overexpression. Importantly, TRIM3 knockdown had reverse effects on cell proliferation, which was suppressed by the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580. In conclusion, the current results demonstrated the downregulation of TRIM3 expression in RA synovial tissues. Importantly, TRIM3 exerted an anti-proliferation role in RA FLS via p38 signaling pathway.

28259951|t|Sox2 inhibits Wnt-b-catenin signaling and metastatic potency of cisplatin-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells.
28259951|a|Lung cancer remains one of the most common cancer-associated mortalities worldwide, and platinum-based doublet chemotherapies are recommended as the first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the frequent development of multidrug resistance, to cisplatin regimens in particular, is a major cause of chemotherapy failure in patients with aggressive NSCLC. Wnt/b-catenin signaling and sex-determining region Y box 2 (Sox2) have been implicated in the development and progression and resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting therapy in lung cancer. The present study aimed to explore the effects of Wnt/b-catenin and Sox2 signaling on the chemoresistance of cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells by assessing the effects of Sox2 on Wnt/b-catenin signaling activity, cell migration, invasion and clonogenicity, and susceptibility to cisplatin in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP cells. The results demonstrated that an enforced expression of Sox2 led to inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling activity, potentially by upregulating glycogen synthase kinase 3 b in A549 and A549/DDP cells. An overexpression of Sox2 promoted cell migration and invasion, in addition to enhancing the clonogenic capacity in A549 cells. Notably, knockdown Sox2 using short hairpin RNA led to an enhanced susceptibility of A549 and A549/DDP cells to cisplatin, along with increased cell apoptosis. The present study thus suggests that Sox2 may be an important regulator in development of chemoresistance of lung cancer cells and may be a novel therapeutic target for treatment chemoresistant lung cancer.

28259970|t|IQGAP1-siRNA inhibits proliferation and metastasis of U251 and U373 glioma cell lines.
28259970|a|IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) is a scaffold protein, which is aberrantly expressed in several tumor types and is closely associated with the development, metastasis and prognosis of cancer. Several studies have demonstrated that IQGAP1 has broad prospects in the basic and clinical research of tumors. The present study aimed to explore the effects of IQGAP1-small interfering (si) NA on the proliferation and metastasis of U251 and U373 glioma cell lines, which markedly expressed IQGAP1. The human glioma cell lines (U251 and U373) were transfected with siRNA and transfection efficacy was confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was detected using the Cell Counting kit-8, and cell metastasis capabilities were detected using cell adhesion, migration and invasion assays. In addition, the expression levels of several tumor-associated genes were determined by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The results indicated that IQGAP1 was expressed at higher levels in glioma tissues compared with in normal brain tissues. IQGAP1-siRNA significantly inhibited cell proliferation, and cell adhesion, migration and invasion. Furthermore, the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, Snail, MMP9, fibronectin 1 and Twist were suppressed, and E-cadherin was upregulated in response to siRNA-IQGAP1. The present study identified the function of IQGAP1 in glioma cell biology, and indicated that it may be considered a novel target for glioma treatment.

28259974|t|3-Hydroxyterphenyllin, a natural fungal metabolite, induces apoptosis and S phase arrest in human ovarian carcinoma cells.
28259974|a|In the present study, we evaluated 3-Hydroxyter-phenyllin (3-HT) as a potential anticancer agent using the human ovarian cancer cells A2780/CP70 and OVCAR-3, and normal human epithelial ovarian cells IOSE-364 as an in vitro model. 3-HT suppressed proliferation and caused cytotoxicity against A2780/CP70 and OVCAR-3 cells, while it exhibited lower cytotoxicity in IOSE-364 cells. Subsequently, we found that 3-HT induced S phase arrest and apoptosis in a dose-independent manner. Further investigation revealed that S phase arrest was related with DNA damage which mediated the ATM/p53/Chk2 pathway. Downregulation of cyclin D1, cyclin A2, cyclin E1, CDK2, CDK4 and Cdc25C, and the upregulation of Cdc25A and cyclin B1 led to the accumulation of cells in S phase. The apoptotic effect was confirmed by Hoechst 33342 staining, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP1. Additional results revealed both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were involved. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway was activated through decreasing the protein levels of Bcl2, Bcl-xL and procaspase-9 and increasing the protein level of Puma. The induction of DR5 and DR4 indicated that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway was also activated. Induction of ROS and activation of ERK were observed in ovarian cancer cells. We therefore concluded that 3-HT possessed anti-proliferative effect on A2780/CP70 and OVCAR-3 cells, induced S phase arrest and caused apoptosis. Taken together, we propose that 3-HT shows promise as a therapeutic candidate for treating ovarian cancer.

28260047|t|Induced pluripotent stem cells from patients with focal cortical dysplasia and refractory epilepsy.
28260047|a|Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is caused by numerous alterations, which can be divided into abnormalities of the cortical architecture and cytological variations; however, the exact etiology of FCD remains unknown. The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the cells of patients with neurological diseases, and their subsequent tissue-specific differentiation, serves as an invaluable source for testing and studying the initial development and subsequent progression of diseases associated with the central nervous system. A total of 2 patients demonstrating seizures refractory to drug treatment, characterized as FCD Type IIb, were enrolled in the present study. Fibroblasts were isolated from residual skin fragments obtained from surgical treatment and from brain samples obtained during surgical resection. iPSCs were generated following exposure of fibroblasts to viral vectors containing POU class 5 homeobox 1 (OCT4), sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), Kruppel-like factor 4 and c-MYC genes, and were characterized by immunohistochemical staining for the pluripotent markers homeobox protein NANOG, SOX2, OCT4, TRA1-60 and TRA1-81. The brain samples were tested with antibodies against protein kinase B (AKT), phosphorylated-AKT, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphorylated-mTOR. Analysis of the AKT/mTOR pathway revealed a statistically significant difference between the cerebral tissues of the two patients, which were of different ages (45 and 12 years old). Clones with the morphological features of embryonic cells were detected on the 13th day and were characterized following three subcultures. The positive staining characteristics of the embryonic cells confirmed the successful generation of iPSCs derived from the patients' fibroblasts. Therefore, the present study presents a method to obtain a useful cellular source that may help to understand embryonic brain development associated with FCD.

28260056|t|Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor-mediated cell survival in hypoxia depends on the promotion of autophagy via suppression of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
28260056|a|Hypoxia is widely accepted as a fundamental biological phenomenon, which is strongly associated with tissue damage and cell viability under stress conditions. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is known to protect tissues from multiple types of damage, and protect cells from apoptosis. Hypoxia is a regulatory factor of the IGF system, however the role of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in hypoxia-induced apoptosis remains unclear. The present study investigated the potential mechanisms associated with IGF-1R-associated apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibiting disruption or overexpression of IGF-1R (R- cells and R+ cells) were used to examine the level of apoptosis, autophagy, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine was used to assess the effect of autophagy on ROS production and apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. A potential downstream signaling pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/threonine protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identifiedby western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that hypoxia induced apoptosis, increased ROS production, and promoted autophagy in a time-dependent manner relative to that observed under normoxia. R+ cells exhibited a lower percentage of apoptotic cells, lower ROS production, and higher levels of autophagy when compared to that of R- cells. In addition, inhibition of autophagy led to increased ROS production and a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the two cell types. Furthermore, IGF-1R is related with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and enhanced autophagy-associated protein expression, which was verified following treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. These results indicated that IGF-1R may increase cell viability under hypoxic conditions by promoting autophagy and scavenging ROS production, which is closed with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

28260057|t|Inhibition of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 ameliorates experimental autoimmune neuritis.
28260057|a|Experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) is a cluster of differentiation 4+ T helper 1 cell-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system and serves as a useful animal model for Guillain-Barre syndrome. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is an important receptor involved in sepsis and the innate inflammatory response. Linear plasmid 17 (LP 17) peptide is a competitive antagonist of TREM-1. To investigate the role of TREM-1 in EAN, 64 male Lewis rats were randomly divided into four groups: Normal saline, complete Freund's adjuvant, EAN and LP 17. The present study assessed the mRNA expression levels of TREM-1, tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-1b in sciatic nerves and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The results demonstrated that inhibiting TREM-1 by administering LP 17 ameliorated symptoms and reduced inflammation in EAN rats. The present study concluded that TREM-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of EAN, and that inhibition of TREM-1 may ameliorate EAN.

28260077|t|Atorvastatin protects against contrast-induced nephropathy via anti-apoptosis by the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro.
28260077|a|Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an iatrogenic acute renal failure occurring following the intravascular injection of iodinated radiographic contrast medium. However, the regulatory mechanisms for CIN remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate whether atorvastatin protects against CIN via anti-apoptotic effects by the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro. To determine whether atorvastatin attenuated CIN, the inflammatory response and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, a rat model of iopamidol-induced CIN was used, and human embryonic proximal tubule (HK2) cell damage was assessed. The rats were assigned into four groups (n=10 per group), as follows: Control rats; rats+atorvastatin; rats + iopamidol; rats+iopamidol+atorvastatin. In vitro, the HK2 cells were treated with iopamidol in the presence or absence of atorvastatin, heat shock protein (Hsp)27 small interfering (si)RNA or pcDNA3.1-Hsp27. The renal tissues were examined histopathologically and collected for western blot analysis. The results showed that atorvastatin ameliorated the apoptosis and deterioration of renal function (P<0.05). Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced the iopamidol-induced activity of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax)/caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in vivo and in vitro. Notably, following treatment with Hsp27 siRNA or pcDNA3.1-Hsp27, it was found that iopamidol enhanced or weakened the upregulation of Bax/caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2 in the HK2 cells, respectively. The results of the present study suggested that atorvastatin protected against contrast-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis through the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro.

28260110|t|Inhibitory effect of emodin on fatty acid synthase, colon cancer proliferation and apoptosis.
28260110|a|Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key anabolic enzyme for de novo fatty acid synthesis, which is important in the development of colon carcinoma. The high expression of FASN is considered a promising molecular target for colon cancer therapy. Emodin, a naturally occurring anthraquinone, exhibits an anticancer effect in various types of human cancer, including colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Cell viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The apoptosis rate of cells was quantified via flow cytometry following Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. FASN activity was measured by monitoring oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate at a wavelength of 340 nm, and intracellular free fatty acid levels were detected using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification kit. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect target gene and protein expression. The present study was performed to investigate whether the gene expression of FASN and its enzymatic activity are regulated by emodin in a human colon cancer cell line. Emodin markedly inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells and a higher protein level of FASN was expressed, compared with that in SW480, SNU-C2A or SNU-C5 cells. Emodin significantly downregulated the protein expression of FASN in HCT116 cells, which was caused by protein degradation due to elevated protein ubiquitination. Emodin also inhibited intracellular FASN enzymatic activity and reduced the levels of intracellular free fatty acids. Emodin enhanced antiproliferation and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The combined treatment of emodin and cerulenin, a commercial FASN inhibitor, had an additive effect on these activities. Palmitate, the final product of the FASN reaction, rescued emodin-induced viability and apoptosis. In addition, emodin altered FASN-involved signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2. These results suggested that emodin-regulated cell growth and apoptosis were mediated by inhibiting FASN and provide a molecular basis for colon cancer therapy.

28270211|t|Syndecan-1 is a novel molecular marker for triple negative inflammatory breast cancer and modulates the cancer stem cell phenotype via the IL-6/STAT3, Notch and EGFR signaling pathways.
28270211|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer, is characterized by cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. Due to a lack of targeted therapies, the identification of molecular markers of IBC is of major importance. The heparan sulfate proteoglycan Syndecan-1 acts as a coreceptor for growth factors and chemokines, modulating inflammation, tumor progression, and cancer stemness, thus it may emerge as a molecular marker for IBC. METHODS: We characterized expression of Syndecan-1 and the CSC marker CD44, Notch-1 & -3 and EGFR in carcinoma tissues of triple negative IBC (n = 13) and non-IBC (n = 17) patients using qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Impact of siRNA-mediated Syndecan-1 knockdown on the CSC phenotype of the human triple negative IBC cell line SUM-149 and HER-2-overexpressing non-IBC SKBR3 cells employing qPCR, flow cytometry, Western blotting, secretome profiling and Notch pharmacological inhibition experiments. Data were statistically analyzed using Student's t-test/Mann-Whitney U-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests. RESULTS: Our data indicate upregulation and a significant positive correlation of Syndecan-1 with CD44 protein, and Notch-1 & -3 and EGFR mRNA in IBC vs non-IBC. ALDH1 activity and the CD44((+))CD24((-/low)) subset as readout of a CSC phenotype were reduced upon Syndecan-1 knockdown. Functionally, Syndecan-1 silencing significantly reduced 3D spheroid and colony formation. Intriguingly, qPCR results indicate downregulation of the IL-6, IL-8, CCL20, gp130 and EGFR mRNA upon Syndecan-1 suppression in both cell lines. Moreover, Syndecan-1 silencing significantly downregulated Notch-1, -3, -4 and Hey-1 in SUM-149 cells, and downregulated only Notch-3 and Gli-1 mRNA in SKBR3 cells. Secretome profiling unveiled reduced IL-6, IL-8, GRO-alpha and GRO a/b/g cytokines in conditioned media of Syndecan-1 knockdown SUM-149 cells compared to controls. The constitutively activated STAT3 and NFkB, and expression of gp130, Notch-1 & -2, and EGFR proteins were suppressed upon Syndecan-1 ablation. Mechanistically, gamma-secretase inhibition experiments suggested that Syndecan-1 may regulate the expression of IL-6, IL-8, gp130, Hey-1, EGFR and p-Akt via Notch signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Syndecan-1 acts as a novel tissue biomarker and a modulator of CSC phenotype of triple negative IBC via the IL-6/STAT3, Notch and EGFR signaling pathways, thus emerging as a promising therapeutic target for IBC.

28292966|t|Endothelial HIF-1a Enables Hypothalamic Glucose Uptake to Drive POMC Neurons.
28292966|a|Glucose is the primary driver of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. We show that endothelial hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a) controls glucose uptake in the hypothalamus and that it is upregulated in conditions of undernourishment, during which POMC neuronal activity is decreased. Endothelium-specific knockdown of HIF-1a impairs the ability of POMC neurons to adapt to the changing metabolic environment in vivo, resulting in overeating after food deprivation in mice. The impaired functioning of POMC neurons was reversed ex vivo or by parenchymal glucose administration. These observations indicate an active role for endothelial cells in the central control of metabolism and suggest that central vascular impairments may cause metabolic disorders.

28294943|t|A team of heterochromatin factors collaborates with small RNA pathways to combat repetitive elements and germline stress.
28294943|a|Repetitive sequences derived from transposons make up a large fraction of eukaryotic genomes and must be silenced to protect genome integrity. Repetitive elements are often found in heterochromatin; however, the roles and interactions of heterochromatin proteins in repeat regulation are poorly understood. Here we show that a diverse set of C. elegans heterochromatin proteins act together with the piRNA and nuclear RNAi pathways to silence repetitive elements and prevent genotoxic stress in the germ line. Mutants in genes encoding HPL-2/HP1, LIN-13, LIN-61, LET-418/Mi-2, and H3K9me2 histone methyltransferase MET-2/SETDB1 also show functionally redundant sterility, increased germline apoptosis, DNA repair defects, and interactions with small RNA pathways. Remarkably, fertility of heterochromatin mutants could be partially restored by inhibiting cep-1/p53, endogenous meiotic double strand breaks, or the expression of MIRAGE1 DNA transposons. Functional redundancy among factors and pathways underlies the importance of safeguarding the genome through multiple means.

28298446|t|Folding of a single domain protein entering the endoplasmic reticulum precedes disulfide formation.
28298446|a|The relationship between protein synthesis, folding, and disulfide formation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that pre-existing disulfide links are absolutely required to allow protein folding and, conversely, that protein folding occurs prior to disulfide formation. To address the question of what happens first within the ER, that is, protein folding or disulfide formation, we studied folding events at the early stages of polypeptide chain translocation into the mammalian ER using stalled translation intermediates. Our results demonstrate that polypeptide folding can occur without complete domain translocation. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) interacts with these early intermediates, but disulfide formation does not occur unless the entire sequence of the protein domain is translocated. This is the first evidence that folding of the polypeptide chain precedes disulfide formation within a cellular context and highlights key differences between protein folding in the ER and refolding of purified proteins.

28300835|t|Geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase inhibition induces apoptosis that is dependent upon GGPP depletion, ERK phosphorylation and caspase activation.
28300835|a|Bisphosphonates are diphosphate analogs that inhibit the intermediate enzymes of the mevalonate pathway. Here, we compared the effects of a farnesyl diphosphate synthase inhibitor, zoledronate, and a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS) inhibitor, digeranyl bisphosphonate (DGBP), on lymphocytic leukemia cell proliferation and apoptosis. Both zoledronate and DGBP inhibited proliferation with DGBP doing so more potently. DGBP was markedly less toxic than zoledronate toward the viability of healthy human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Addition of GGPP, but not farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), prevented the anti-proliferative effects of DGBP. Both GGPP and FPP partially rescued the effects of zoledronate. Co-treatment with DGBP and zoledronate was antagonistic. To further assess the effects of the bisphosphonates, we analyzed annexin V and propidium iodide staining via flow cytometry and found that DGBP induced apoptosis more potently than zoledronate. Western blots show that DGBP treatment altered expression and membrane affinity of some but not all geranylgeranylated small GTPases, activated caspases and increased ERK phosphorylation. Importantly, the anti-proliferative effects of DGBP were blocked by treatment with a caspase inhibitor and by treatment with a MEK inhibitor. Together, our findings indicate that DGBP is a more potent and selective compound than zoledronate in inducing apoptosis mediated through pathways that include caspases and MEK/ERK. These findings support the further development of GGDPS inhibitors as anticancer therapeutics.

28320736|t|Arabidopsis RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED directly regulates DNA damage responses through functions beyond cell cycle control.
28320736|a|The rapidly proliferating cells in plant meristems must be protected from genome damage. Here, we show that the regulatory role of the Arabidopsis RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED (RBR) in cell proliferation can be separated from a novel function in safeguarding genome integrity. Upon DNA damage, RBR and its binding partner E2FA are recruited to heterochromatic gH2AX-labelled DNA damage foci in an ATM- and ATR-dependent manner. These gH2AX-labelled DNA lesions are more dispersedly occupied by the conserved repair protein, AtBRCA1, which can also co-localise with RBR foci. RBR and AtBRCA1 physically interact in vitro and in planta Genetic interaction between the RBR-silenced amiRBR and Atbrca1 mutants suggests that RBR and AtBRCA1 may function together in maintaining genome integrity. Together with E2FA, RBR is directly involved in the transcriptional DNA damage response as well as in the cell death pathway that is independent of SOG1, the plant functional analogue of p53. Thus, plant homologs and analogues of major mammalian tumour suppressor proteins form a regulatory network that coordinates cell proliferation with cell and genome integrity.

28324051|t|Androgen Stimulates Growth of Mouse Preantral Follicles In Vitro: Interaction With Follicle-Stimulating Hormone and With Growth Factors of the TGFb Superfamily.
28324051|a|Androgens are essential for the normal function of mature antral follicles but also have a role in the early stages of follicle development. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common cause of anovulatory infertility, is characterized by androgen excess and aberrant follicle development that includes accelerated early follicle growth. We have examined the effects of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on development of isolated mouse preantral follicles in culture with the specific aim of investigating interaction with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), the steroidogenic pathway, and growth factors of the TGFb superfamily that are known to have a role in early follicle development. Both testosterone and DHT stimulated follicle growth and augmented FSH-induced growth and increased the incidence of antrum formation among the granulosa cell layers of these preantral follicles after 72 hours in culture. Effects of both androgens were reversed by the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide. FSH receptor expression was increased in response to both testosterone and DHT, as was that of Star, whereas Cyp11a1 was down-regulated. The key androgen-induced changes in the TGFb signaling pathway were down-regulation of Amh, Bmp15, and their receptors. Inhibition of Alk6 (Bmpr1b), a putative partner for Amhr2 and Bmpr2, by dorsomorphin resulted in augmentation of androgen-stimulated growth and modification of androgen-induced gene expression. Our findings point to varied effects of androgen on preantral follicle growth and function, including interaction with FSH-activated growth and steroidogenesis, and, importantly, implicate the intrafollicular TGFb system as a key mediator of androgen action. These findings provide insight into abnormal early follicle development in PCOS.

28333137|t|The mTOR signal regulates myeloid-derived suppressor cells differentiation and immunosuppressive function in acute kidney injury.
28333137|a|The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal controls innate and adaptive immune response in multiple immunoregulatory contexts. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of myeloid cells of potent immunosuppressive capacity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of MDSCs in the protection of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the regulation of mTOR signal on MDSC's protective role in this context. In mice AKI model, rapamycin administration was associated with improved renal function, restored histological damage and decreased CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell infiltration in kidney tissue. MDSCs, especially CD11b(+)Ly6G(+)Ly6C(low) G-MDSCs were recruited to the injured kidney following the interaction of CXCL1, CXCL2 and their receptor CXCR2 after inhibiting mTOR signal with rapamycin treatment. The adoptive transfer of rapamycin-treated MDSCs into the mice with AKI significantly improved the renal function, ameliorated histologic damages and limited the infiltration of T cells in kidney tissue. In addition, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IFN-g mRNA was downregulated while the expression of TGF-b1 and Foxp3 mRNA was upregulated in kidney tissue after transferring rapamycin-treated MDSCs. Adoptive transfer of rapamycin-treated MDSCs also downregulated the serum levels of IL-1b, IL-6 and IFN-g and upregulated the serum levels of TGF-b1 compared with the IR group and PBS-treated MDSC group. In in vitro study, inhibiting mTOR signal regulated the induction of MDSC towards the CD11b(+)Ly6G(+)Ly6C(low) G-MDSC subset. The ability to suppress T-cell proliferation of both bone marrow-derived CD11b(+)Ly6G(+)Ly6C(low) G-MDSCs and CD11b(+)Ly6G(-)Ly6C(high) M-MDSCs was enhanced by mTOR signal inhibition via upregulating the expression of Arginase-1 and iNOS. Accordingly, both G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs presented downregulated runx1 gene expression after rapamycin treatment. Taken together, our results demonstrated that MDSCs ameliorated AKI and the protective effect was enhanced by mTOR signal inhibition via promoting MDSCs recruitment, regulating the induction of MDSCs and strengthening their immunosuppressive activity.

28334792|t|GWAS identifies population-specific new regulatory variants in FUT6 associated with plasma B12 concentrations in Indians.
28334792|a|Vitamin B12 is an important cofactor in one-carbon metabolism whose dysregulation is associated with various clinical conditions. Indians have a high prevalence of B12 deficiency but little is known about the genetic determinants of circulating B12 concentrations in Indians. We performed a genome-wide association study in 1001 healthy participants in the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study (PMNS), replication studies in 3418 individuals from other Indian cohorts and by meta-analysis identified new variants, rs3760775 (P = 1.2 x 10-23) and rs78060698 (P = 8.3 x 10-17) in FUT6 to be associated with circulating B12 concentrations. Although in-silico analysis replicated both variants in Europeans, differences in the effect allele frequency, effect size and the linkage disequilibrium structure of credible set variants with the reported variants suggest population-specific characteristics in this region. We replicated previously reported variants rs602662, rs601338 in FUT2, rs3760776, rs708686 in FUT6, rs34324219 in TCN1 (all P < 5 x 10-8), rs1131603 in TCN2 (P = 3.4 x 10-5), rs12780845 in CUBN (P = 3.0 x 10-3) and rs2270655 in MMAA (P = 2.0 x 10-3). Circulating B12 concentrations in the PMNS and Parthenon study showed a significant decline with increasing age (P < 0.001), however, the genetic contribution to B12 concentrations remained constant. Luciferase reporter and electrophoretic-mobility shift assay for the FUT6 variant rs78060698 using HepG2 cell line demonstrated strong allele-specific promoter and enhancer activity and differential binding of HNF4a, a key regulator of expression of various fucosyltransferases. Hence, the rs78060698 variant, through regulation of fucosylation may control intestinal host-microbial interaction which could influence B12 concentrations. Our results suggest that in addition to established genetic variants, population-specific variants are important in determining plasma B12 concentrations.

28339048|t|AGR2 ameliorates tumor necrosis factor-a-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction via suppression of NF-kB p65-mediated MLCK/p-MLC pathway activation.
28339048|a|Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Anterior gradient protein 2 homologue (AGR2) assists in maintaining intestinal homeostasis in dextran sulphate sodium-induced mouse ileocolitis; however, it is unclear whether it modulates intestinal barrier function. Our study aimed to investigate the protective role of AGR2 in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a-induced intestinal epithelial barrier injury. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pre-transfected with an AGR2 plasmid and then exposed to TNF-a. Epithelial permeability was assessed by detecting transepithelial electrical resistance and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (40 kDa) flux. The protein expression levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, claudin-1, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)/p-MLC, and nuclear factor (NF)-kB p65 were determined by western blotting. In addition, the cellular distributions of ZO-1, occludin, F-actin, and NF-kB p65 were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that the AGR2 mRNA and protein expression levels were both decreased in the Caco-2 cell monolayers, while AGR2 overexpression significantly ameliorated TNF-a-induced epithelial barrier hyperpermeability, increased the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins and stabilized the cytoskeletal structure. Furthermore, AGR2 inhibited the changes in MLCK, MLC and p-MLC expression in response to TNF-a stimulation. Collectively, our study suggests that AGR2 inhibits TNF-a-induced Caco-2 cell hyperpermeability by regulating TJ and that this protective mechanism may be promoted by inhibition of NF-kB p65-mediated activation of the MLCK/p-MLC signaling pathway.

28346424|t|Skp2 deficiency restricts the progression and stem cell features of castration-resistant prostate cancer by destabilizing Twist.
28346424|a|Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains a major clinical challenge because of the lack of effective targeted therapy for its treatment. The mechanism underlying how CRPC gains resistance toward hormone depletion and other forms of chemotherapy is poorly understood. Research on understanding the factors that drive these processes is desperately needed to generate new therapies to cure the disease. Here, we discovered a fundamental role of S-phase protein kinase 2 (Skp2) in the formation and progression of CRPC. In transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate model, Skp2 depletion leads to a profound repression of prostate tumor growth and distal metastasis and substantially prolonged overall survival. We revealed that Skp2 regulates CRPC through Twist-mediated oncogenic functions including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) acquisitions. Mechanistically, Skp2 interacted with Twist and promoted the non-degradative ubiquitination of Twist. Consequently, Skp2 stabilized Twist protein expression by preventing proteasomal degradation of Twist by b-TrCP. We found that Twist overexpression augments CSC self-renewal and population and that Skp2 inhibition reverts Twist's effects on CSC regulation. Furthermore, genetically depleting or pharmacologically inactivating Skp2 synergistically re-sensitized CRPC cells toward chemotherapies such as paclitaxel or doxorubicin. Together, this study uncovering Skp2-mediated Twist stabilization and oncogenic functions in CRPC offers new knowledge on how CRPC progresses and acquires chemoresistance during tumor progression. It provides proof of principle that Skp2 targeting is a promising approach to combat metastatic CRPC by targeting Twist and CSCs.

28347651|t|Selective Targeting of SH2 Domain-Phosphotyrosine Interactions of Src Family Tyrosine Kinases with Monobodies.
28347651|a|The binding of Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains to phosphotyrosine (pY) sites is critical for the autoinhibition and substrate recognition of the eight Src family kinases (SFKs). The high sequence conservation of the 120 human SH2 domains poses a significant challenge to selectively perturb the interactions of even the SFK SH2 family against the rest of the SH2 domains. We have developed synthetic binding proteins, termed monobodies, for six of the SFK SH2 domains with nanomolar affinity. Most of these monobodies competed with pY ligand binding and showed strong selectivity for either the SrcA (Yes, Src, Fyn, Fgr) or SrcB subgroup (Lck, Lyn, Blk, Hck). Interactome analysis of intracellularly expressed monobodies revealed that they bind SFKs but no other SH2-containing proteins. Three crystal structures of monobody-SH2 complexes unveiled different and only partly overlapping binding modes, which rationalized the observed selectivity and enabled structure-based mutagenesis to modulate inhibition mode and selectivity. In line with the critical roles of SFK SH2 domains in kinase autoinhibition and T-cell receptor signaling, monobodies binding the Src and Hck SH2 domains selectively activated respective recombinant kinases, whereas an Lck SH2-binding monobody inhibited proximal signaling events downstream of the T-cell receptor complex. Our results show that SFK SH2 domains can be targeted with unprecedented potency and selectivity using monobodies. They are excellent tools for dissecting SFK functions in normal development and signaling and to interfere with aberrant SFK signaling networks in cancer cells.

28348168|t|FGFR2 is required for airway basal cell self-renewal and terminal differentiation.
28348168|a|Airway stem cells slowly self-renew and produce differentiated progeny to maintain homeostasis throughout the lifespan of an individual. Mutations in the molecular regulators of these processes may drive cancer or degenerative disease, but are also potential therapeutic targets. Conditionally deleting one copy of FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) in adult mouse airway basal cells results in self-renewal and differentiation phenotypes. We show that FGFR2 signalling correlates with maintenance of expression of a key transcription factor for basal cell self-renewal and differentiation: SOX2. This heterozygous phenotype illustrates that subtle changes in receptor tyrosine kinase signalling can have significant effects, perhaps providing an explanation for the numerous changes seen in cancer.

28350299|t|Dual role for Jumu in the control of hematopoietic progenitors in the Drosophila lymph gland.
28350299|a|The Drosophila lymph gland is a hematopoietic organ in which the maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cell fate relies on intrinsic factors and extensive interaction with cells within a microenvironment. The posterior signaling center (PSC) is required for maintaining the balance between progenitors and their differentiation into mature hemocytes. Moreover, some factors from the progenitors cell-autonomously control blood cell differentiation. Here, we show that Jumeau (Jumu), a member of the forkhead (Fkh) transcription factor family, controls hemocyte differentiation of lymph gland through multiple regulatory mechanisms. Jumu maintains the proper differentiation of prohemocytes by cell-autonomously regulating the expression of Col in medullary zone and by non-cell-autonomously preventing the generation of expanded PSC cells. Jumu can also cell-autonomously control the proliferation of PSC cells through positive regulation of dMyc expression. We also show that a deficiency of jumu throughout the lymph gland can induce the differentiation of lamellocytes via activating Toll signaling.

28359316|t|Evaluation of pancreatic cancer cell migration with multiple parameters in vitro by using an optical real-time cell mobility assay device.
28359316|a|BACKGROUND: Migration of cancer cell correlates with distant metastasis and local invasion, which are good targets for cancer treatment. An optically accessible device "TAXIScan" was developed, which provides considerably more information regarding the cellular dynamics and less quantity of samples than do the existing methods. Here, we report the establishment of a system to analyze the nature of pancreatic cancer cells using TAXIScan and we evaluated lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-elicited pancreatic cell migration. METHODS: Pancreatic cancer cell lines, BxPC3, PANC-1, AsPC1, and MIAPaCa-2, were analyzed for adhesion as well as migration towards LPA by TAXIScan using parameters such as velocity and directionality or for the number of migrated cells by the Boyden chamber methods. To confirm that the migration was initiated by LPA, the expression of LPA receptors and activation of intracellular signal transductions were examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase reaction and western blotting. RESULTS: Scaffold coating was necessary for the adhesion of pancreatic cancer cells, and collagen I and Matrigel were found to be good scaffolds. BxPC3 and PANC-1 cells clearly migrated towards the concentration gradient formed by injecting 1 uL LPA, which was abrogated by pre-treatment with LPA inhibitor, Ki16425 (IC50 for the directionality ~ 1.86 uM). The LPA dependent migration was further confirmed by mRNA and protein expression of LPA receptors as well as phosphorylation of signaling molecules. LPA1 mRNA was highest among the 6 receptors, and LPA1, LPA2 and LPA3 proteins were detected in BxPC3 and PANC-1 cells. Phosphorylation of Akt (Thr308 and Ser473) and p42/44MAPK in BxPC3 and PANC-1 cells was observed after LPA stimulation, which was clearly inhibited by pre-treatment with a compound Ki16425. CONCLUSIONS: We established a novel pancreatic cancer cell migration assay system using TAXIScan. This assay device provides multiple information on migrating cells simultaneously, such as their morphology, directionality, and velocity, with a small volume of sample and can be a powerful tool for analyzing the nature of cancer cells and for identifying new factors that affect cell functions.

28363904|t|Hydrogen Peroxide Triggers a Dual Signaling Axis To Selectively Suppress Activated Human T Lymphocyte Migration.
28363904|a|H2O2 is an early danger cue required for innate immune cell recruitment to wounds. To date, little is known about whether H2O2 is required for the migration of human adaptive immune cells to sites of inflammation. However, oxidative stress is known to impair T cell activity, induce actin stiffness, and inhibit cell polarization. In this study, we show that low oxidative concentrations of H2O2 also impede chemokinesis and chemotaxis of previously activated human T cells to CXCL11, but not CXCL10 or CXCL12. We show that this deficiency in migration is due to a reduction in inflammatory chemokine receptor CXCR3 surface expression and cellular activation of lipid phosphatase SHIP-1. We demonstrate that H2O2 acts through an Src kinase to activate a negative regulator of PI3K signaling, SHIP-1 via phosphorylation, providing a molecular mechanism for H2O2-induced chemotaxis deficiency. We hypothesize that although H2O2 serves as an early recruitment trigger for innate immune cells, it appears to operate as an inhibitor of T lymphocyte immune adaptive responses that are not required until later in the repair process.

28368403|t|HBEGF promotes gliomagenesis in the context of Ink4a/Arf and Pten loss.
28368403|a|Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HBEGF) is a ligand for the EGF receptor (EGFR), one of the most commonly amplified receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in glioblastoma (GBM). While HBEGF has been found to be expressed in a subset of malignant gliomas, its sufficiency for glioma initiation has not been evaluated. In this study, we demonstrate that HBEGF can initiate GBM in mice in the context of Ink4a/Arf and Pten loss, and that these tumors are similar to the classical GBM subtype observed in patients. Isogenic astrocytes from these mice showed activation not only of Egfr but also the RTK Axl in response to HBEGF stimulation. Deletion of either Egfr or Axl decreased the tumorigenic properties of HBEGF-transformed cells; however, only EGFR was able to rescue the phenotype in cells lacking both RTKs indicating that Egfr is required for activation of Axl in this context. Silencing of HBEGF in vivo resulted in tumor regression and significantly increased survival, suggesting that HBEGF may be a clinically relevant target.

28368423|t|Myc enhances B-cell receptor signaling in precancerous B cells and confers resistance to Btk inhibition.
28368423|a|Dysregulation of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC induces B-cell transformation and is a driver for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). MYC overexpression in B-NHL is associated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. Although genomic studies suggest a link between MYC overexpression and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling molecules in B-NHL, signaling pathways essential to Myc-mediated B-cell transformation have not been fully elucidated. We utilized intracellular phospho-flow cytometry to investigate the relationship between Myc and BCR signaling in pre-malignant B cells. Utilizing the Eu-myc mouse model, where Myc is overexpressed specifically in B cells, both basal and stimulated BCR signaling were increased in precancerous B lymphocytes from Eu-myc mice compared with wild-type littermates. B cells overexpressing Myc displayed constitutively higher levels of activated CD79a, Btk, Plcg2 and Erk1/2. Notably, Myc-overexpressing B cells maintained elevated BCR signaling despite treatment with ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, PI3K/Akt pathway signaling was also increased in Eu-myc B cells, and this increase was partially suppressed with ibrutinib. In addition, experiments with Btk-null B cells revealed off-target effects of ibrutinib on BCR signaling. Our data show that in pre-malignant B cells, Myc overexpression is sufficient to activate BCR and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and further enhances signaling following BCR ligation. Therefore, our results indicate that precancerous B cells have already acquired enhanced survival and growth capabilities before transformation, and that elevated MYC levels confer resistance to pharmacologic inhibitors of BCR signaling, which has significant implications for B-NHL treatment.

28369266|t|Klinefelter syndrome comorbidities linked to increased X chromosome gene dosage and altered protein interactome activity.
28369266|a|Klinefelter syndrome (KS) (47,XXY) is the most common male sex chromosome aneuploidy. Diagnosis and clinical supervision remain a challenge due to varying phenotypic presentation and insufficient characterization of the syndrome. Here we combine health data-driven epidemiology and molecular level systems biology to improve the understanding of KS and the molecular interplay influencing its comorbidities. In total, 78 overrepresented KS comorbidities were identified using in- and out-patient registry data from the entire Danish population covering 6.8 million individuals. The comorbidities extracted included both clinically well-known (e.g. infertility and osteoporosis) and still less established KS comorbidities (e.g. pituitary gland hypofunction and dental caries). Several systems biology approaches were applied to identify key molecular players underlying KS comorbidities: Identification of co-expressed modules as well as central hubs and gene dosage perturbed protein complexes in a KS comorbidity network build from known disease proteins and their protein-protein interactions. The systems biology approaches together pointed to novel aspects of KS disease phenotypes including perturbed Jak-STAT pathway, dysregulated genes important for disturbed immune system (IL4), energy balance (POMC and LEP) and erythropoietin signalling in KS. We present an extended epidemiological study that links KS comorbidities to the molecular level and identify potential causal players in the disease biology underlying the identified comorbidities.

28369421|t|Searching for biomarkers of CDKL5 disorder: early-onset visual impairment in CDKL5 mutant mice.
28369421|a|CDKL5 disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder still without a cure. Murine models of CDKL5 disorder have been recently generated raising the possibility of preclinical testing of treatments. However, unbiased, quantitative biomarkers of high translational value to monitor brain function are still missing. Moreover, the analysis of treatment is hindered by the challenge of repeatedly and non-invasively testing neuronal function. We analyzed the development of visual responses in a mouse model of CDKL5 disorder to introduce visually evoked responses as a quantitative method to assess cortical circuit function. Cortical visual responses were assessed in CDKL5 null male mice, heterozygous females, and their respective control wild-type littermates by repeated transcranial optical imaging from P27 until P32. No difference between wild-type and mutant mice was present at P25-P26 whereas defective responses appeared from P27-P28 both in heterozygous and homozygous CDKL5 mutant mice. These results were confirmed by visually evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded from the visual cortex of a different cohort. The previously imaged mice were also analyzed at P60-80 using VEPs, revealing a persistent reduction of response amplitude, reduced visual acuity and defective contrast function. The level of adult impairment was significantly correlated with the reduction in visual responses observed during development. Support vector machine showed that multi-dimensional visual assessment can be used to automatically classify mutant and wt mice with high reliability. Thus, monitoring visual responses represents a promising biomarker for preclinical and clinical studies on CDKL5 disorder.

28375585|t|Downregulation of Talin1 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression through activation of the ERK1/2 pathway.
28375585|a|Talin1 is an adaptor protein that conjugates integrins to the cytoskeleton and regulates integrins and focal adhesion signaling. Several studies have found that Talin1 is overexpressed in several tumor types and promotes tumor progression. However, the explicit role of Talin1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is still unclear and its functional mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we showed a trend of gradually decreasing expression of Talin1 from normal liver tissues to hepatocirrhosis, liver hyperplasia, the corresponding adjacent non-tumor, primary HCC, and eventually metastatic foci, indicating that Talin1 may correlate with HCC initiation to progression. Talin1 was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues and low Talin1 expression was associated with HCC progression and poor prognosis. Furthermore, Talin1 knockdown induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promoted migration and invasion in SK-Hep-1 cells and HepG2 cells. Mechanistically, we found that the ERK pathway was responsible for these promoting effects of Talin1 knockdown in HCC cells. The promoting effects of Talin1 knockdown on epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion were reversed by U0126, a specific ERK1/2 inhibitor. Taken together, our results suggested that Talin1 might serve as a tumor suppressor in HCC and a potential prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.

28376832|t|Serum HOTAIR as a novel diagnostic biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
28376832|a|BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an important issue to improve the prognosis. HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expressed from the HOXC locus, has been recently revealed as an oncogenic regulator in ESCC. This study aimed to investigate whether serum HOTAIR is involved in the diagnosis of ESCC. METHODS: In this study, we detected serum HOTAIR expression in 50 patients with ESCC (including 42 tumor resection and 8 without surgery) and 20 healthy volunteers to investigate the role of serum HOTAIR in ESCC using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method. RESULTS: Clinical data indicated that serum HOTAIR were correlated with TNM stage. The expression level of serum HOTAIR (0.189 + 0.010) was significantly higher in ESCC patients compared with that of healthy controls (0.055 + 0.008, P < 0.01). The ROC curve analysis yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.692 to 0.895, P < 0.01). Also, the serum HOTAIR expression level decreased obviously in postoperative samples (one month after the surgery) compared to preoperative specimens. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between serum HOTAIR expression and the expression of HOTAIR in ESCC tissue according to Pearson correlation analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study, for the first time, demonstrated that serum HOTAIR might serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of ESCC.

28393188|t|A heptameric peptide purified from Spirulina sp. gastrointestinal hydrolysate inhibits angiotensin I-converting enzyme- and angiotensin II-induced vascular dysfunction in human endothelial cells.
28393188|a|In this study, a marine microalga Spirulina sp.-derived protein was hydrolyzed using gastrointestinal enzymes to produce an angiotensin I (Ang I)-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide. Following consecutive purification, the potent ACE inhibitory peptide was composed of 7 amino acids, Thr-Met-Glu-Pro-Gly-Lys-Pro (molecular weight, 759 Da). Analysis using the Lineweaver-Burk plot and molecular modeling suggested that the purified peptide acted as a mixed non-competitive inhibitor of ACE. The inhibitory effects of the peptide against the cellular production of vascular dysfunction-related factors induced by Ang II were also investigated. In human endothelial cells, the Ang II-induced production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species was inhibited, and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) was downregulated when the cells were cultured with the purified peptide. Moreover, the peptide blocked the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results indicated that this Spirulina sp.-derived peptide warrants further investigation as a potential pharmacological inhibitor of ACE and vascular dysfunction.

28393239|t|Psoriasin promotes invasion, aggregation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells; association with disease progression.
28393239|a|Psoriasin (S100A7) is an 11-kDa small calcium binding protein initially isolated from psoriatic skin lesions. It belongs to the S100 family of proteins which play an important role in a range of cell functions including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. Aberrant Psoriasin expression has been implicated in a range of cancers and is often associated with poor prognosis. This study examined the role of Psoriasin on pancreatic cancer cell functions and the implication in progression of the disease. Expression of Psoriasin was determined in a cohort of pancreatic tissues comprised of 126 pancreatic tumours and 114 adjacent non-tumour pancreatic tissues. Knockdown and overexpression of Psoriasin in pancreatic cancer cells was performed using specifically constructed plasmids, which either had anti-Psoriasin ribozyme transgene or the full length human Psoriasin coding sequence. Psoriasin knockdown and overexpression was verified using conventional RT-PCR and qPCR. The effect of manipulating Psoriasin expression on pancreatic cancer cell functions was assessed using several in vitro cell function assays. Local invasive pancreatic cancers extended beyond the pancreas expressed higher levels of Psoriasin transcripts compared with the cancers confined to the pancreas. Primary tumours with distant metastases exhibited a reduced expression of Psoriasin. Psoriasin overexpression cell lines exhibited significantly increased growth and migration compared to control cells. In addition, Psoriasin overexpression resulted in increased pancreatic cancer cell invasion which was associated with upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Overexpression of Psoriasin also promoted aggregation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells when they lost anchorage. Taken together, higher expression of Psoriasin was associated with local invasion in pancreatic cancers. Psoriasin expression is associated with pancreatic cancer cell growth, migration, cell-matrix adhesion, and invasion via regulation of MMPs. As such, the proposed implications of Psoriasin in invasion, disease progression and as a potential therapeutic target warrant further investigation.

28393242|t|Overexpression of Srcin1 contributes to the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer.
28393242|a|The adaptor protein Srcin1 is a novel Src-binding protein that regulates Src activation through C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). Srcin1 behaves as a tumour suppressor in breast cancer, but the role of Srcin1 in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unknown. In the present study, Srcin1 expression in normal tissue was examined by tissue microarray and assessed by immunohistochemistry in 10 patients. In addition, the biological impact of Srcin1 knockdown on CRC cells was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that Srcin1 was expressed in different types of normal human tissues, whereas its expression was increased in human CRC tissues. Srcin1 expression also correlated with tumour progression. The suppression of Srcin1 induced cell differentiation and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, Srcin1 increased cell growth as well as the capacity of migration and invasion in CRC cells. Srcin1 induced the activation of the Wnt/b-catenin signalling pathway. Moreover, Srcin1 suppression sensitized cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate that Srcin1 contributes to CRC carcinogenesis, invasion and metastasis. These findings provide a rationale for a mechanistic approach to CRC treatment based on the development of Srcin1-targeted therapies.

28393246|t|The downstream of tyrosine kinase 7 is reduced in lung cancer and is associated with poor survival of patients with lung cancer.
28393246|a|The downstream of tyrosine kinase 7 (DOK7) is an adaptor protein mediating signalling transduction between receptors and intracellular downstream molecules. Reduced expression of DOK7 has been observed in breast cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the role played by DOK7 in lung cancer. The expression of DOK7 at both mRNA and protein levels was evaluated in human lung cancer. A reduced expression of DOK7 transcripts was seen in lung cancers compared with normal lung tissues. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that the reduced expression of DOK7 was associated with poorer overall survival and progression-free survival of patients with lung cancer. A further western blot analysis revealed a predominant expression of DOK7 isoform 1 (DOK7V1) in normal lung tissues, which was reduced in lung cancer. Forced overexpression of DOK7V1 in lung cancer cell lines, A549 and H3122 resulted in a decrease of in vitro cell proliferation and migration, while adhesion to extracellular matrix was enhanced following the expression. In conclusion, DOK7 was reduced in lung cancer and reduced DOK7 expression was associated with poorer survival. DOK7 isoform 1 plays an inhibitory role on the proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells in which Akt pathway may be involved.

28398466|t|Novel nesprin-1 mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy cause nuclear envelope disruption and defects in myogenesis.
28398466|a|Nesprins-1 and -2 are highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle and together with SUN (Sad1p/UNC84)-domain containing proteins and lamin A/C form the LInker of Nucleoskeleton-and-Cytoskeleton (LINC) bridging complex at the nuclear envelope (NE). Mutations in nesprin-1/2 have previously been found in patients with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) as well as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this study, three novel rare variants (R8272Q, S8381C and N8406K) in the C-terminus of the SYNE1 gene (nesprin-1) were identified in seven DCM patients by mutation screening. Expression of these mutants caused nuclear morphology defects and reduced lamin A/C and SUN2 staining at the NE. GST pull-down indicated that nesprin-1/lamin/SUN interactions were disrupted. Nesprin-1 mutations were also associated with augmented activation of the ERK pathway in vitro and in hearts in vivo. During C2C12 muscle cell differentiation, nesprin-1 levels are increased concomitantly with kinesin light chain (KLC-1/2) and immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down showed that these proteins interacted via a recently identified LEWD domain in the C-terminus of nesprin-1. Expression of nesprin-1 mutants in C2C12 cells caused defects in myoblast differentiation and fusion associated with dysregulation of myogenic transcription factors and disruption of the nesprin-1 and KLC-1/2 interaction at the outer nuclear membrane. Expression of nesprin-1a2 WT and mutants in zebrafish embryos caused heart developmental defects that varied in severity. These findings support a role for nesprin-1 in myogenesis and muscle disease, and uncover a novel mechanism whereby disruption of the LINC complex may contribute to the pathogenesis of DCM.

28403862|t|MUC1 in lung adenocarcinoma: cross-sectional genetic and serological study.
28403862|a|BACKGROUND: Mucin 1 (MUC1) contributes to the growth and metastasis of various cancers, including lung cancer, and MUC1 gene length polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to lung cancer and its prognosis. In contrast, the association between rs4072037, a single nucleotide polymorphism in MUC1, and lung cancer has not been well studied. METHODS: In the present study, we determined the rs4072037 genotype and measured serum KL-6 levels to evaluate the association between lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and rs4072037 or serum KL-6 levels. DNA samples were available for 172 patients and these were included in the genomic analyses. In addition, 304 patients were included in the serum analyses. Furthermore, 276 healthy volunteers were included in both genomic and serum analyses. RESULTS: The rs4072037 genotype was not associated with susceptibility to lung ADC or its prognosis. Interestingly, serum KL-6 levels significantly differed according to rs4072037 genotype in those with T1 or T2 (P < 0.001), N0 or N1 (P = 0.002) and M0 (P < 0.001), but not in those with T3 or T4 (P = 0.882), N2 or N3 (P = 0.616) and M1a or M1b (P = 0.501). Serum KL-6 levels were significantly associated with the presence of lung ADC, as well as with its progression and prognosis, indicating the crucial involvement of KL-6/MUC1 in the development of lung cancer and its progression. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we conclude that rs4072037 does not have a significant impact on the pathogenesis or prognosis of lung ADC, whereas serum KL-6 levels, which might reflecting the molecular length of MUC1, are significantly associated with lung ADC.

28403887|t|Global analysis of H3K27me3 as an epigenetic marker in prostate cancer progression.
28403887|a|BACKGROUND: H3K27me3 histone marks shape the inhibition of gene transcription. In prostate cancer, the deregulation of H3K27me3 marks might play a role in prostate tumor progression. METHODS: We investigated genome-wide H3K27me3 histone methylation profile using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and 2X400K promoter microarrays to identify differentially-enriched regions in biopsy samples from prostate cancer patients. H3K27me3 marks were assessed in 34 prostate tumors: 11 with Gleason score > 7 (GS > 7), 10 with Gleason score < 7 (GS < 7), and 13 morphologically normal prostate samples. RESULTS: Here, H3K27me3 profiling identified an average of 386 enriched-genes on promoter regions in healthy control group versus 545 genes in GS < 7 and 748 genes in GS > 7 group. We then ran a factorial discriminant analysis (FDA) and compared the enriched genes in prostate-tumor biopsies and normal biopsies using ANOVA to identify significantly differentially-enriched genes. The analysis identified ALG5, EXOSC8, CBX1, GRID2, GRIN3B, ING3, MYO1D, NPHP3-AS1, MSH6, FBXO11, SND1, SPATS2, TENM4 and TRA2A genes. These genes are possibly associated with prostate cancer. Notably, the H3K27me3 histone mark emerged as a novel regulatory mechanism in poor-prognosis prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to epigenetic mark H3K27me3 as an important event in prostate carcinogenesis and progression. The results reported here provide new molecular insights into the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

28406475|t|Depletion of polycomb repressive complex 2 core component EED impairs fetal hematopoiesis.
28406475|a|Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a H3K27me3 methyltransferase complex, promotes the development of many organs by silencing ectopic transcription program. However, currently little is known about the role of PRC2 in blood and vascular development. In this study, we interrogated the function of embryonic ectoderm development (EED), a core PRC2 component, in both endothelial and hematopoietic tissues by inactivating a floxed murine EED allele with Tie2Cre, which catalyzes recombination in endothelial and hematopoietic lineages. Murine EED(fl/fl);Tie2Cre (EED(CKO)) embryos died at embryonic day (E) 13.5. We did not observe structural abnormalities of blood vessels or cardiac valves, suggesting that EED is dispensable in endothelial cells for initial steps of vascular development. EED(CKO) embryos were pale and had abnormal livers. Flow cytometry of fetal liver cells showed that EED depletion significantly impeded erythroid maturation. There was a corresponding increase in myeloid progenitors and granulocytes and macrophages, suggesting an attenuated differentiation path in myeloid lineages. Moreover, EED depletion impaired the generation of hematopoietic stem cells. Collectively, our study demonstrates that within Tie2Cre-recombined embryonic cells, EED is required for proper erythropoiesis and for formation of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells, but is dispensable for endothelial lineage commitment and early vascular patterning.

28411266|t|Genetic Variation at the Sulfonylurea Receptor, Type 2 Diabetes, and Coronary Heart Disease.
28411266|a|Despite widespread clinical use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the impact of sulfonylurea therapy on cardiovascular outcomes remains uncertain. Studies of naturally occurring genetic variation can be used to anticipate the expected clinical consequences of a pharmacological therapy. A common missense variant in the gene encoding a component of the sulfonylurea receptor (ABCC8 p.A1369S) promotes closure of the target channel of sulfonylurea therapy and is associated with increased insulin secretion, thus mimicking the effects of sulfonylurea therapy. Using individual-level data from 120,286 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from four large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the impact of this variant on cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. The p.A1369S variant was associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.93; 95% CI 0.91, 0.95; P = 1.2 x 10(-11)). The variant was associated with increased BMI (+0.062 kg/m(2); 95% CI 0.037, 0.086; P = 8.1 x 10(-7)) but lower waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI, a marker of abdominal fat distribution. Furthermore, p.A1369S was associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96, 0.99; P = 5.9 x 10(-4)). These results suggest that, despite a known association with increased weight, long-term sulfonylurea therapy may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.

28414304|t|Transforming activity and therapeutic targeting of C-terminal-binding protein 2 in Apc-mutated neoplasia.
28414304|a|Overexpression of the transcriptional coregulators C-terminal binding proteins 1 and 2 (CtBP1 and 2) occurs in many human solid tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. CtBP modulates oncogenic gene expression programs and is an emerging drug target, but its oncogenic role is unclear. Consistent with this oncogenic potential, exogenous CtBP2 transformed primary mouse and human cells to anchorage independence similarly to mutant H-Ras. To investigate CtBP's contribution to in vivo tumorigenesis, Apc(min/+) mice, which succumb to massive intestinal polyposis, were bred to Ctbp2(+/-) mice. CtBP interacts with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, and is stabilized in both APC-mutated human colon cancers and Apc(min/+) intestinal polyps. Ctbp2 heterozygosity increased the median survival of Apc(min/+) mice from 21 to 48 weeks, and reduced polyp formation by 90%, with Ctbp2(+/-) polyps exhibiting reduced levels of b-catenin and its oncogenic transcriptional target, cyclin D1. CtBP's potential as a therapeutic target was studied by treating Apc(min/+) mice with the CtBP small-molecule inhibitors 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyric acid and 2-hydroxy-imino phenylpyruvic acid, both of which reduced polyposis by more than half compared with vehicle treatment. Phenocopying Ctbp2 deletion, both Ctbp inhibitors caused substantial decreases in the protein level of Ctbp2, as well its oncogenic partner b-catenin, and the effects of the inhibitors on CtBP and b-catenin levels could be modeled in an APC-mutated human colon cancer cell line. CtBP2 is thus a druggable transforming oncoprotein critical for the evolution of neoplasia driven by Apc mutation.

28416580|t|A TSPO ligand attenuates brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage.
28416580|a|Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease without effective treatment. After ICH, the immediate infiltration of leukocytes and activation of microglia are accompanied by a rapid up-regulation of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). TSPO ligands have shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in models of CNS injury. In this study, we determined the impact of a TSPO ligand, etifoxine, on brain injury and inflammation in 2 mouse models of ICH. TSPO was up-regulated in Iba1(+) cells from brains of patients with ICH and in CD11b(+)CD45(int) cells from mice subjected to collagenase-induced ICH. Etifoxine significantly reduced neurodeficits and perihematomal brain edema after ICH induction by injection of either autologous blood or collagenase. In collagenase-induced ICH mice, the protection of etifoxine was associated with reduced leukocyte infiltration into the brain and microglial production of IL-6 and TNF-a. Etifoxine improved blood-brain barrier integrity and diminished cell death. Notably, the protective effect of etifoxine was abolished in mice depleted of microglia by using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor. These results indicate that the TSPO ligand etifoxine attenuates brain injury and inflammation after ICH. TSPO may be a viable therapeutic target that requires further investigations in ICH.-Li, M., Ren, H., Sheth, K. N., Shi, F.-D., Liu, Q. A TSPO ligand attenuates brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage.

28428256|t|Regulation of lung endothelial permeability and inflammatory responses by prostaglandin A2: role of EP4 receptor.
28428256|a|The role of prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) in modulation of vascular endothelial function is unknown. We investigated effects of PGA2 on pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) permeability and inflammatory activation and identified a receptor mediating these effects. PGA2 enhanced the EC barrier and protected against barrier dysfunction caused by vasoactive peptide thrombin and proinflammatory bacterial wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Receptor screening using pharmacological and molecular inhibitory approaches identified EP4 as a novel PGA2 receptor. EP4 mediated barrier-protective effects of PGA2 by activating Rap1/Rac1 GTPase and protein kinase A targets at cell adhesions and cytoskeleton: VE-cadherin, p120-catenin, ZO-1, cortactin, and VASP. PGA2 also suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory signaling by inhibiting the NFkB pathway and expression of EC adhesion molecules ICAM1 and VCAM1. These effects were abolished by pharmacological or molecular inhibition of EP4. In vivo, PGA2 was protective in two distinct models of acute lung injury (ALI): LPS-induced inflammatory injury and two-hit ALI caused by suboptimal mechanical ventilation and injection of thrombin receptor-activating peptide. These protective effects were abolished in mice with endothelial-specific EP4 knockout. The results suggest a novel role for the PGA2-EP4 axis in vascular EC protection that is critical for improvement of pathological states associated with increased vascular leakage and inflammation.

28428259|t|RABL2 interacts with the intraflagellar transport-B complex and CEP19 and participates in ciliary assembly.
28428259|a|Proteins localized to the basal body and the centrosome play crucial roles in ciliary assembly and function. Although RABL2 and CEP19 are conserved in ciliated organisms and have been implicated in ciliary/flagellar functions, their roles are poorly understood. Here we show that RABL2 interacts with CEP19 and is recruited to the mother centriole and basal body in a CEP19-dependent manner and that CEP19 is recruited to the centriole probably via its binding to the centrosomal protein FGFR1OP. Disruption of the RABL2 gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii results in the nonflagellated phenotype, suggesting a crucial role of RABL2 in ciliary/flagellar assembly. We also show that RABL2 interacts, in its GTP-bound state, with the intraflagellar transport (IFT)-B complex via the IFT74-IFT81 heterodimer and that the interaction is disrupted by a mutation found in male infertile mice (Mot mice) with a sperm flagella motility defect. Intriguingly, RABL2 binds to CEP19 and the IFT74-IFT81 heterodimer in a mutually exclusive manner. Furthermore, exogenous expression of the GDP-locked or Mot-type RABL2 mutant in human cells results in mild defects in ciliary assembly. These results indicate that RABL2 localized to the basal body plays crucial roles in ciliary/flagellar assembly via its interaction with the IFT-B complex.

28436950|t|MRE11 stability is regulated by CK2-dependent interaction with R2TP complex.
28436950|a|The MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex is essential for repair of DNA double-strand breaks and stalled replication forks. Mutations of the MRN complex subunit MRE11 cause the hereditary cancer-susceptibility disease ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD). Here we show that MRE11 directly interacts with PIH1D1, a subunit of heat-shock protein 90 cochaperone R2TP complex, which is required for the assembly of large protein complexes, such as RNA polymerase II, small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. The MRE11-PIH1D1 interaction is dependent on casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation of two acidic sequences within the MRE11 C terminus containing serines 558/561 and 688/689. Conversely, the PIH1D1 phospho-binding domain PIH-N is required for association with MRE11 phosphorylated by CK2. Consistent with these findings, depletion of PIH1D1 resulted in MRE11 destabilization and affected DNA-damage repair processes dependent on MRE11. Additionally, mutations of serines 688/689, which abolish PIH1D1 binding, also resulted in decreased MRE11 stability. As depletion of R2TP frequently leads to instability of its substrates and as truncation mutation of MRE11 lacking serines 688/689 leads to decreased levels of the MRN complex both in ATLD patients and an ATLD mouse model, our results suggest that the MRN complex is a novel R2TP complex substrate and that their interaction is regulated by CK2 phosphorylation.

28468941|t|Aberrant caveolin-1-mediated Smad signaling and proliferation identified by analysis of adenine 474 deletion mutation (c.474delA) in patient fibroblasts: a new perspective on the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension.
28468941|a|A heterozygous caveolin-1 c.474delA mutation has been identified in a family with heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This frameshift mutation leads to a caveolin-1 protein that contains all known functional domains but has a change in only the final 20 amino acids of the C-terminus. Here we studied how this mutation alters caveolin-1 function, using patient-derived fibroblasts. Transmission electron microscopy showed that fibroblasts carrying the c.474delA mutation form typical caveolae. Expression of mutated caveolin-1 in caveolin-1-null mouse fibroblasts failed to induce formation of caveolae due to retention of the mutated protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, coexpression of wild-type caveolin-1 with mutated caveolin-1 restored the ability to form caveolae. Importantly, fibroblasts carrying the mutation showed twofold increase in proliferation rate associated with hyperphosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. This mutation impaired the antiproliferative function of caveolin-1. Inhibition of type I TGFb receptors ALK1/2/3/6 responsible for phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 reduced the hyperproliferation seen in c.474delA fibroblasts. These results demonstrate the critical role of the final 20 amino acids of caveolin-1 in modulating fibroblast proliferation by dampening Smad signaling and suggest that augmented Smad signaling and fibroblast hyperproliferation are contributing factors in the pathogenesis of PAH in patients with caveolin-1 c.474delA mutation.

28481876|t|Oncogenic activity of amplified miniature chromosome maintenance 8 in human malignancies.
28481876|a|Miniature chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins play critical roles in DNA replication licensing, initiation and elongation. MCM8, one of the MCM proteins playing a critical role in DNA repairing and recombination, was found to have overexpression and increased DNA copy number in a variety of human malignancies. The gain of MCM8 is associated with aggressive clinical features of several human cancers. Increased expression of MCM8 in prostate cancer is associated with cancer recurrence. Forced expression of MCM8 in RWPE1 cells, the immortalized but non-transformed prostate epithelial cell line, exhibited fast cell growth and transformation, while knock down of MCM8 in PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells induced cell growth arrest, and decreased tumour volumes and mortality of severe combined immunodeficiency mice xenografted with PC3 and DU145 cells. MCM8 bound cyclin D1 and activated Rb protein phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 in vitro and in vivo. The cyclin D1/MCM8 interaction is required for Rb phosphorylation and S-phase entry in cancer cells. As a result, our study showed that copy number increase and overexpression of MCM8 may play critical roles in human cancer development.

28481877|t|CYP4A in tumor-associated macrophages promotes pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis.
28481877|a|Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an essential role in metastasis. However, what enables TAMs to have a superior capacity to establish pre-metastatic microenvironment in distant organs is unclear. Here we have begun to uncover the effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4A in TAMs on lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. CYP4A(+) TAM infiltration was positively associated with metastasis, pre-metastatic niche formation and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The pharmacological inhibition of CYP4A reduced lung pre-metastatic niche formation (evidenced by a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 positive (VEGFR1(+)) myeloid cell recruitment and pro-metastatic protein expression) and metastatic burden, accompanied with TAM polarization away from the M2 phenotype in spontaneous metastasis models of 4T1 breast cancer and B16F10 melanoma. Co-implantation of 4T1 cells with CYP4A10(high) macrophages promoted lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. Depletion of TAMs disrupted lung pre-metastatic niches and thereby prevented metastasis. Treatment with the CM from CYP4A10(high) M2 macrophages (M2) increased pre-metastatic niche formation and metastatic burden in the lungs, whereas CYP4A inhibition attenuated these effects. In vitro TAM polarization away from the M2 phenotype induced by CYP4A inhibition decreased VEGFR1(+) myeloid cell migration and fibronectin expression, accompanied with downregulation of STAT3 signaling. Conversely, overexpression of CYP4A or exogenous addition of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid promoted M2 polarization and cytokine production of macrophages and thereby enhanced migration of VEGFR1(+) myeloid cells, which were reversed by siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of STAT3. Importantly, a combined blocking M2 macrophage-derived factors TGF-b, VEGF and SDF-1 abolished VEGFR1(+) myeloid cell migration and fibroblast activation induced by CYP4A. In summary, CYP4A in TAMs is crucial for lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in human cancer.

28498971|t|Deletion of RhoA in Progesterone Receptor-Expressing Cells Leads to Luteal Insufficiency and Infertility in Female Mice.
28498971|a|Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA) is widely expressed throughout the female reproductive system. To assess its role in progesterone receptor-expressing cells, we generated RhoA conditional knockout mice RhoAd/d (RhoAf/f-Pgr-Cre+/-). RhoAd/d female mice had comparable mating activity, serum luteinizing hormone, prolactin, and estradiol levels and ovulation with control but were infertile with progesterone insufficiency, indicating impaired steroidogenesis in RhoAd/d corpus luteum (CL). RhoA was highly expressed in wild-type luteal cells and conditionally deleted in RhoAd/d CL. Gestation day 3.5 (D3.5) RhoAd/d ovaries had reduced numbers of CL, less defined corpus luteal cord formation, and disorganized CL collagen IV staining. RhoAd/d CL had lipid droplet and free cholesterol accumulation, indicating the availability of cholesterol for steroidogenesis, but disorganized b-actin and vimentin staining, indicating disrupted cytoskeleton integrity. Cytoskeleton is important for cytoplasmic cholesterol movement to mitochondria and for regulating mitochondria. Dramatically reduced expression of mitochondrial markers heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), voltage-dependent anion channel, and StAR was detected in RhoAd/d CL. StAR carries out the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis. StAR messenger RNA expression was reduced in RU486-treated D3.5 wild-type CL and tended to be induced in progesterone-treated D3.5 RhoAd/d CL, with parallel changes of HSP60 expression. These data demonstrated the in vivo function of RhoA in CL luteal cell cytoskeleton integrity, cholesterol transport, StAR expression, and progesterone synthesis, and a positive feedback on StAR expression in CL by progesterone signaling. These findings provide insights into mechanisms of progesterone insufficiency.

28534510|t|Targeting group I p21-activated kinases to control malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor growth and metastasis.
28534510|a|Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are devastating sarcomas for which no effective medical therapies are available. Over 50% of MPSNTs are associated with mutations in NF1 tumor suppressor gene, resulting in activation of Ras and its effectors, including the Raf/Mek/Erk and PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling cascades, and also the WNT/b-catenin pathway. As Group I p21-activated kinases (Group I Paks, PAK1/2/3) have been shown to modulate Ras-driven oncogenesis, we asked if these enzymes might regulate signaling in MPNSTs. In this study we found a strong positive correlation between the activity of PAK1/2/3 and the stage of human MPNSTs. We determined that reducing Group I Pak activity diminished MPNST cell proliferation and motility, and that these effects were not accompanied by significant blockade of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway, but rather by reductions in Akt and b-catenin activity. Using the small molecule PAK1/2/3 inhibitor Frax1036 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901, we showed that the combination of these two agents synergistically inhibited MPNST cell growth in vitro and dramatically decreased local and metastatic MPNST growth in animal models. Taken together, these data provide new insights into MPNST signaling deregulation and suggest that co-targeting of PAK1/2/3 and MEK1/2 may be effective in the treatment of patients with MPNSTs.

28576769|a|The morphogenesis of the vertebrate limbs is a complex process in which cell signaling and transcriptional regulation coordinate diverse structural adaptations in diverse species. In this study, we examine the consequences of altering Hand1 dimer choice regulation within developing vertebrate limbs. Although Hand1 deletion via the limb-specific Prrx1-Cre reveals a non-essential role for Hand1 in mouse limb morphogenesis, altering Hand1 phosphoregulation, and consequently Hand1 dimerization affinities, results in a severe truncation of proximal-anterior limb elements. Molecular analysis reveals a non-cell-autonomous mechanism that causes widespread cell death within the embryonic limb bud. In addition, we observe changes in proximal-anterior gene regulation, including a reduction in the expression of Irx3, Irx5, Gli3 and Alx4, all of which are upregulated in Hand2 limb conditional knockouts. A reduction of Hand2 and Shh gene dosage improves the integrity of anterior limb structures, validating the importance of the Twist-family bHLH dimer pool in limb morphogenesis.

28581519|t|Autophagy suppresses Ras-driven epithelial tumourigenesis by limiting the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.
28581519|a|Activation of Ras signalling occurs in ~30% of human cancers; however, activated Ras alone is not sufficient for tumourigenesis. In a screen for tumour suppressors that cooperate with oncogenic Ras (Ras(V12)) in Drosophila, we identified genes involved in the autophagy pathway. Bioinformatic analysis of human tumours revealed that several core autophagy genes, including GABARAP, correlate with oncogenic KRAS mutations and poor prognosis in human pancreatic cancer, supporting a potential tumour-suppressive effect of the pathway in Ras-driven human cancers. In Drosophila, we demonstrate that blocking autophagy at any step of the pathway enhances Ras(V12)-driven epithelial tissue overgrowth via the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and activation of the Jun kinase stress response pathway. Blocking autophagy in Ras(V12) clones also results in non-cell-autonomous effects with autophagy, cell proliferation and caspase activation induced in adjacent wild-type cells. Our study has implications for understanding the interplay between perturbations in Ras signalling and autophagy in tumourigenesis, which might inform the development of novel therapeutics targeting Ras-driven cancers.Oncogene advance online publication, 5 June 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.175.

28584052|t|Mutations in N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase in patients with X-linked intellectual disability.
28584052|a|N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) regulates protein O-GlcNAcylation, an essential and dynamic post-translational modification. The O-GlcNAc modification is present on numerous nuclear and cytosolic proteins and has been implicated in essential cellular functions such as signaling and gene expression. Accordingly, altered levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation have been associated with developmental defects and neurodegeneration. However, mutations in the OGT gene have not yet been functionally confirmed in humans. Here, we report on two hemizygous mutations in OGT in individuals with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and dysmorphic features: one missense mutation (p.Arg284Pro) and one mutation leading to a splicing defect (c.463-6T>G). Both mutations reside in the tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT that are essential for substrate recognition. We observed slightly reduced levels of OGT protein and reduced levels of its opposing enzyme O-GlcNAcase in both patient-derived fibroblasts, but global O-GlcNAc levels appeared to be unaffected. Our data suggest that mutant cells attempt to maintain global O-GlcNAcylation by down-regulating O-GlcNAcase expression. We also found that the c.463-6T>G mutation leads to aberrant mRNA splicing, but no stable truncated protein was detected in the corresponding patient-derived fibroblasts. Recombinant OGT bearing the p.Arg284Pro mutation was prone to unfolding and exhibited reduced glycosylation activity against a complex array of glycosylation substrates and proteolytic processing of the transcription factor host cell factor 1, which is also encoded by an XLID-associated gene. We conclude that defects in O-GlcNAc homeostasis and host cell factor 1 proteolysis may play roles in mediation of XLID in individuals with OGT mutations.

28604678|t|Dynamic subunit turnover in ESCRT-III assemblies is regulated by Vps4 to mediate membrane remodelling during cytokinesis.
28604678|a|The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III mediates membrane fission in fundamental cellular processes, including cytokinesis. ESCRT-III is thought to form persistent filaments that over time increase their curvature to constrict membranes. Unexpectedly, we found that ESCRT-III at the midbody of human cells rapidly turns over subunits with cytoplasmic pools while gradually forming larger assemblies. ESCRT-III turnover depended on the ATPase VPS4, which accumulated at the midbody simultaneously with ESCRT-III subunits, and was required for assembly of functional ESCRT-III structures. In vitro, the Vps2/Vps24 subunits of ESCRT-III formed side-by-side filaments with Snf7 and inhibited further polymerization, but the growth inhibition was alleviated by the addition of Vps4 and ATP. High-speed atomic force microscopy further revealed highly dynamic arrays of growing and shrinking ESCRT-III spirals in the presence of Vps4. Continuous ESCRT-III remodelling by subunit turnover might facilitate shape adaptions to variable membrane geometries, with broad implications for diverse cellular processes.

28628113|t|MicroRNA-20a-mediated loss of autophagy contributes to breast tumorigenesis by promoting genomic damage and instability.
28628113|a|Gene expression analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer data set show that miR-20a is upregulated in human breast cancer, especially in triple-negative subtype. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis suggests that miR-20a expression negatively correlates with the autophagy/lysosome pathway. We report here that miR-20a inhibits the basal and nutrient starvation-induced autophagic flux and lysosomal proteolytic activity, increases intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and DNA damage response by targeting several key regulators of autophagy, including BECN1, ATG16L1 and SQSTM1. Re-introduction of exogenous BECN1, ATG16L1 or SQSTM1 reverses the inhibitory effect of miR-20a on autophagy and decreases DNA damage. A negative correlation between miR-20a and its target genes is observed in breast cancer tissues. Lower levels of BECN1, ATG16L1 and SQSTM1 are more common in triple-negative cancers than in other subtypes. High levels of miR-20a also associate with higher frequency of copy-number alterations and DNA mutations in breast cancer patients. Further studies in a xenograft mouse model show that miR-20a promotes tumor initiation and tumor growth. Collectively, these findings suggest that miR-20a-mediated autophagy defect might be a new mechanism underlying the oncogenic function of miRNA during breast tumorigenesis.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 June 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.193.

28650467|t|Genome-wide loss-of-function genetic screening identifies opioid receptor u1 as a key regulator of L-asparaginase resistance in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
28650467|a|L-asparaginase is a critical chemotherapeutic agent for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It hydrolyzes plasma asparagine into aspartate and NH3, causing asparagine deficit and inhibition of protein synthesis and eventually, leukemic cell death. However, patient relapse often occurs due to development of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which ALL cells acquire resistance to L-asparaginase is unknown. Therefore, we sought to identify genes that are involved in L-asparaginase resistance in primary leukemic cells. By unbiased genome-wide RNAi screening, we found that among 10 resistant ALL clones, six hits were for opioid receptor mu 1 (oprm1), two hits were for carbonic anhydrase 1 (ca1) and another two hits were for ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (ube2c). We also found that OPRM1 is expressed in all leukemic cells tested. Specific knockdown of OPRM1 confers L-asparaginase resistance, validating our genome-wide retroviral shRNA library screening data. Methadone, an agonist of OPRM1, enhances the sensitivity of parental leukemic cells, but not OPRM1-depleted cells, to L-asparaginase treatment, indicating that OPRM1 is required for the synergistic action of L-asparaginase and methadone, and that OPRM1 loss promotes leukemic cell survival likely through downregulation of the OPRM1-mediated apoptotic pathway. Consistent with this premise, patient leukemic cells with relatively high levels of OPRM1 are more sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment compared to OPRM1-depleted leukemic cells, further indicating that OPRM1 loss has a crucial role in L-asparaginase resistance in leukemic patients. Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time, a novel OPRM1-mediated mechanism for L-asparaginase resistance in ALL, and identifies OPRM1 as a functional biomarker for defining high-risk subpopulations and for the detection of evolving resistant clones. Oprm1 may also be utilized for effective treatment of L-asparaginase-resistant ALL.Oncogene advance online publication, 26 June 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.211.

28652571|t|Discovery of long-range inhibitory signaling to ensure single axon formation.
28652571|a|A long-standing question in neurodevelopment is how neurons develop a single axon and multiple dendrites from common immature neurites. Long-range inhibitory signaling from the growing axon is hypothesized to prevent outgrowth of other immature neurites and to differentiate them into dendrites, but the existence and nature of this inhibitory signaling remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that axonal growth triggered by neurotrophin-3 remotely inhibits neurite outgrowth through long-range Ca(2+) waves, which are delivered from the growing axon to the cell body. These Ca(2+) waves increase RhoA activity in the cell body through calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I. Optogenetic control of Rho-kinase combined with computational modeling reveals that active Rho-kinase diffuses to growing other immature neurites and inhibits their outgrowth. Mechanistically, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I phosphorylates a RhoA-specific GEF, GEF-H1, whose phosphorylation enhances its GEF activity. Thus, our results reveal that long-range inhibitory signaling mediated by Ca(2+) wave is responsible for neuronal polarization.Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota influences immune function in the brain and may play a role in neurological diseases. Here, the authors offer in vivo evidence from a Drosophila model that supports a role for gut microbiota in modulating the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

28660748|t|Angiotensin II subtype 1a receptor signaling in resident hepatic macrophages induces liver metastasis formation.
28660748|a|Liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) are a clinically significant problem. The renin-angiotensin system is involved in tumor growth and metastases. This study was designed to evaluate the role of angiotensin II subtype receptor 1a (AT1a) in the formation of liver metastasis in CRC. A model of liver metastasis was developed by intrasplenic injection of mouse colon cancer (CMT-93) into AT1a knockout mice (AT1aKO) and wild-type (C57BL/6) mice (WT). Compared with WT mice, the liver weight and liver metastatic rate were significantly lower in AT1aKO. The mRNA levels of CD31, transforming growth factor- b1 (TGF-b1), and F4/80 were suppressed in AT1aKO compared with WT. Double immunofluorescence analysis showed that the number of accumulated F4/80(+) cells expressing TGF-b1 in metastatic areas was higher in WT than in AT1aKO. The AT1aKO bone marrow (BM) (AT1aKO-BM)>WT showed suppressed formation of liver metastasis compared with WT-BM>WT. However, the formation of metastasis was further suppressed in WT-BM>AT1aKO compared with AT1aKO-BM>WT. In addition, accumulated F4/80(+) cells in the liver metastasis were not BM-derived F4/80(+) cells, but mainly resident hepatic F4/80(+) cells, and these resident hepatic F4/80(+) cells were positive for TGF-b1. Angiotensin II enhanced TGF-b1 expression in Kupffer cells. Treatment of WT with clodronate liposomes suppressed liver metastasis by diminishing TGF-b1(+) F4/80(+) cells accumulation. The formation of liver metastasis correlated with collagen deposition in the metastatic area, which was dependent on AT1a signaling. These results suggested that resident hepatic macrophages induced liver metastasis formation by induction of TGF-b1 through AT1a signaling.

28684635|t|A Type 2 Diabetes-Associated Functional Regulatory Variant in a Pancreatic Islet Enhancer at the ADCY5 Locus.
28684635|a|Molecular mechanisms remain unknown for most type 2 diabetes genome-wide association study identified loci. Variants associated with type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose levels reside in introns of ADCY5, a gene that encodes adenylate cyclase 5. Adenylate cyclase 5 catalyzes the production of cyclic AMP, which is a second messenger molecule involved in cell signaling and pancreatic b-cell insulin secretion. We demonstrated that type 2 diabetes risk alleles are associated with decreased ADCY5 expression in human islets and examined candidate variants for regulatory function. rs11708067 overlaps a predicted enhancer region in pancreatic islets. The type 2 diabetes risk rs11708067-A allele showed fewer H3K27ac ChIP-seq reads in human islets, lower transcriptional activity in reporter assays in rodent b-cells (rat 832/13 and mouse MIN6), and increased nuclear protein binding compared with the rs11708067-G allele. Homozygous deletion of the orthologous enhancer region in 832/13 cells resulted in a 64% reduction in expression level of Adcy5, but not adjacent gene Sec22a, and a 39% reduction in insulin secretion. Together, these data suggest that rs11708067-A risk allele contributes to type 2 diabetes by disrupting an islet enhancer, which results in reduced ADCY5 expression and impaired insulin secretion.

28687665|t|Mutation of the a-tubulin Tuba1a leads to straighter microtubules and perturbs neuronal migration.
28687665|a|Brain development involves extensive migration of neurons. Microtubules (MTs) are key cellular effectors of neuronal displacement that are assembled from a/b-tubulin heterodimers. Mutation of the a-tubulin isotype TUBA1A is associated with cortical malformations in humans. In this study, we provide detailed in vivo and in vitro analyses of Tuba1a mutants. In mice carrying a Tuba1a missense mutation (S140G), neurons accumulate, and glial cells are dispersed along the rostral migratory stream in postnatal and adult brains. Live imaging of Tuba1a-mutant neurons revealed slowed migration and increased neuronal branching, which correlated with directionality alterations and perturbed nucleus-centrosome (N-C) coupling. Tuba1a mutation led to increased straightness of newly polymerized MTs, and structural modeling data suggest a conformational change in the a/b-tubulin heterodimer. We show that Tuba8, another a-tubulin isotype previously associated with cortical malformations, has altered function compared with Tuba1a. Our work shows that Tuba1a plays an essential, noncompensated role in neuronal saltatory migration in vivo and highlights the importance of MT flexibility in N-C coupling and neuronal-branching regulation during neuronal migration.

28701508|t|Prdm1 Regulates Thymic Epithelial Function To Prevent Autoimmunity.
28701508|a|Autoimmunity is largely prevented by medullary thymic epithelial cells (TECs) through their expression and presentation of tissue-specific Ags to developing thymocytes, resulting in deletion of self-reactive T cells and supporting regulatory T cell development. The transcription factor Prdm1 has been implicated in autoimmune diseases in humans through genome-wide association studies and in mice using cell type-specific deletion of Prdm1 in T and dendritic cells. In this article, we demonstrate that Prdm1 functions in TECs to prevent autoimmunity in mice. Prdm1 is expressed by a subset of mouse TECs, and conditional deletion of Prdm1 in either Keratin 14- or Foxn1-expressing cells in mice resulted in multisymptom autoimmune pathology. Notably, the development of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells occurs normally in the absence of Blimp1. Importantly, nude mice developed anti-nuclear Abs when transplanted with Prdm1 null TECs, but not wild-type TECs, indicating that Prdm1 functions in TECs to regulate autoantibody production. We show that Prdm1 acts independently of Aire, a crucial transcription factor implicated in medullary TEC function. Collectively, our data highlight a previously unrecognized role for Prdm1 in regulating thymic epithelial function.

28777492|t|Gankyrin induces STAT3 activation in tumor microenvironment and sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.
28777492|a|Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) develop as a result of chronic liver inflammation. We have shown that the oncoprotein gankyrin is critical for inflammation-induced tumorigenesis in the colon. Although the in vitro function of gankyrin is well known, its role in vivo remains to be elucidated. We investigated the effect of gankyrin in the tumor microenvironment of mice with liver parenchymal cell-specific gankyrin ablation (Alb-Cre;gankyrin(f/f) ) and gankyrin deletion both in liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells (Mx1-Cre;gankyrin(f/f) ). Gankyrin upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in tumor cells. Gankyrin binds to Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), mainly expressed in liver non-parenchymal cells, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Gankyrin deficiency in non-parenchymal cells, but not in parenchymal cells, reduced STAT3 activity, interleukin (IL)-6 production, and cancer stem cell marker (Bmi1 and epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM]) expression, leading to attenuated tumorigenic potential. Chronic inflammation enhances gankyrin expression in the human liver. Gankyrin expression in the tumor microenvironment is negatively correlated with progression-free survival in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment for HCC. Thus, gankyrin appears to play a critical oncogenic function in tumor microenvironment and may be a potential target for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies against HCC.

28801319|t|Pet10p is a yeast perilipin that stabilizes lipid droplets and promotes their assembly.
28801319|a|Pet10p is a yeast lipid droplet protein of unknown function. We show that it binds specifically to and is stabilized by droplets containing triacylglycerol (TG). Droplets isolated from cells with a PET10 deletion strongly aggregate, appear fragile, and fuse in vivo when cells are cultured in oleic acid. Pet10p binds early to nascent droplets, and their rate of appearance is decreased in pet10D Moreover, Pet10p functionally interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum droplet assembly factors seipin and Fit2 to maintain proper droplet morphology. The activity of Dga1p, a diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and TG accumulation were both 30-35% lower in the absence of Pet10p. Pet10p contains a PAT domain, a defining property of perilipins, which was not previously known to exist in yeast. We propose that the core functions of Pet10p and other perilipins extend beyond protection from lipases and include the preservation of droplet integrity as well as collaboration with seipin and Fit2 in droplet assembly and maintenance.

28814288|t|Monoallelic characteristic-bearing heterozygous L1053X in BRCA2 gene among Sudanese women with breast cancer.
28814288|a|BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer in women. Among many risk factors of BC, mutations in BRCA2 gene were found to be the primary cause in 5-10% of cases. The majority of deleterious mutations are frameshift or nonsense mutations. Most of the reported BRCA2 mutations are protein truncating mutations. METHODS: The study aimed to describe the pattern of mutations including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and variants of the BRCA2 (exon11) gene among Sudanese women patients diagnosed with BC. In this study a specific region of BRCA2 exon 11 was targeted using PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Early onset cases 25/45 (55.6%) were premenopausal women with a mean age of 36.6 years. Multiparity was more frequent within the study amounting to 30 cases (66.6%), with a mean parity of 4.1. Ductal type tumor was the predominant type detected in 22 cases (48.8%) among the reported histotypes. A heterozygous monoallelic nonsense mutation at nucleotide 3385 was found in four patients out of 9, where TTA codon was converted into the stop codon TGA. CONCLUSION: This study detected a monoallelic nonsense mutation in four Sudanese female patients diagnosed with early onset BC from different families. Further work is needed to demonstrate its usefulness in screening of BC.

28842469|t|A20 Restrains Thymic Regulatory T Cell Development.
28842469|a|Maintaining immune tolerance requires the production of Foxp3-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells in the thymus. Activation of NF-kB transcription factors is critically required for Treg cell development, partly via initiating Foxp3 expression. NF-kB activation is controlled by a negative feedback regulation through the ubiquitin editing enzyme A20, which reduces proinflammatory signaling in myeloid cells and B cells. In naive CD4(+) T cells, A20 prevents kinase RIPK3-dependent necroptosis. Using mice deficient for A20 in T lineage cells, we show that thymic and peripheral Treg cell compartments are quantitatively enlarged because of a cell-intrinsic developmental advantage of A20-deficient thymic Treg differentiation. A20-deficient thymic Treg cells exhibit reduced dependence on IL-2 but unchanged rates of proliferation and apoptosis. Activation of the NF-kB transcription factor RelA was enhanced, whereas nuclear translocation of c-Rel was decreased in A20-deficient thymic Treg cells. Furthermore, we found that the increase in Treg cells in T cell-specific A20-deficient mice was already observed in CD4(+) single-positive CD25(+) GITR(+) Foxp3(-) thymic Treg cell progenitors. Treg cell precursors expressed high levels of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily molecule GITR, whose stimulation is closely linked to thymic Treg cell development. A20-deficient Treg cells efficiently suppressed effector T cell-mediated graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, suggesting normal suppressive function. Holding thymic production of natural Treg cells in check, A20 thus integrates Treg cell activity and increased effector T cell survival into an efficient CD4(+) T cell response.

28851297|t|An Ag-globin G->A gene polymorphism associated with b(0)39 thalassemia globin gene and high fetal hemoglobin production.
28851297|a|BACKGROUND: Increase of the expression of g-globin gene and high production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in b-thalassemia patients is widely accepted as associated with a milder or even asymptomatic disease. The search for HbF-associated polymorphisms (such as the XmnI, BCL11A and MYB polymorphisms) has recently gained great attention, in order to stratify b-thalassemia patients with respect to expectancy of the first transfusion, need for annual intake of blood, response to HbF inducers (the most studied of which is hydroxyurea). METHODS: Ag-globin gene sequencing was performed on genomic DNA isolated from a total of 75 b-thalassemia patients, including 31 b(0)39/b(0)39, 33 b(0)39/b(+)IVSI-110, 9 b(+)IVSI-110/b(+)IVSI-110, one b(0)IVSI-1/b(+)IVSI-6 and one b(0)39/b(+)IVSI-6. RESULTS: The results show that the rs368698783 polymorphism is present in b-thalassemia patients in the 5'UTR sequence (+25) of the Ag-globin gene, known to affect the LYAR (human homologue of mouse Ly-1 antibody reactive clone) binding site 5'-GGTTAT-3'. This Ag(+25 G->A) polymorphism is associated with the Gg-globin-XmnI polymorphism and both are linked with the b(0)39-globin gene, but not with the b(+)IVSI-110-globin gene. In agreement with the expectation that this mutation alters the LYAR binding activity, we found that the Ag(+25 G->A) and Gg-globin-XmnI polymorphisms are associated with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells isolated from b(0)39/b(0)39 thalassemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: As a potential explanation of our findings, we hypothesize that in b-thalassemia the Gg-globin-XmnI/Ag-globin-(G->A) genotype is frequently under genetic linkage with b(0)-thalassemia mutations, but not with the b(+)-thalassemia mutation here studied (i.e. b(+)IVSI-110) and that this genetic combination has been selected within the population of b(0)-thalassemia patients, due to functional association with high HbF. Here we describe the characterization of the rs368698783 (+25 G->A) polymorphism of the Ag-globin gene associated in b(0)39 thalassemia patients with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells.

28859089|t|Flavin monooxygenases regulate Caenorhabditis elegans axon guidance and growth cone protrusion with UNC-6/Netrin signaling and Rac GTPases.
28859089|a|The guidance cue UNC-6/Netrin regulates both attractive and repulsive axon guidance.

We have also shown that inhibition of growth cone protrusion downstream of the UNC-5:UNC-40 repulsive receptor involves Rac GTPases, the Rac GTP exchange factor UNC-73/Trio, and the cytoskeletal regulator UNC-33/CRMP, which mediates Semaphorin-induced growth cone collapse in other systems. The multidomain flavoprotein monooxygenase (FMO) MICAL (Molecule Interacting with CasL) also mediates growth cone collapse in response to Semaphorin by directly oxidizing F-actin, resulting in depolymerization. The C. elegans genome does not encode a multidomain MICAL-like molecule, but does encode five flavin monooxygenases (FMO-1, -2, -3, -4, and 5) and another molecule, EHBP-1, similar to the non-FMO portion of MICAL. Here we show that FMO-1, FMO-4, FMO-5, and EHBP-1 may play a role in UNC-6/Netrin directed repulsive guidance mediated through UNC-40 and UNC-5 receptors. Mutations in fmo-1, fmo-4, fmo-5, and ehbp-1 showed VD/DD axon guidance and branching defects, and variably enhanced unc-40 and unc-5 VD/DD axon guidance defects. Developing growth cones in vivo of fmo-1, fmo-4, fmo-5, and ehbp-1 mutants displayed excessive filopodial protrusion, and transgenic expression of FMO-5 inhibited growth cone protrusion. Mutations suppressed growth cone inhibition caused by activated UNC-40 and UNC-5 signaling, and activated Rac GTPase CED-10 and MIG-2, suggesting that these molecules are required downstream of UNC-6/Netrin receptors and Rac GTPases. From these studies we conclude that FMO-1, FMO-4, FMO-5, and EHBP-1 represent new players downstream of UNC-6/Netrin receptors and Rac GTPases that inhibit growth cone filopodial protrusion in repulsive axon guidance.

28882895|t|Peptide array based screening reveals a large number of proteins interacting with the ankyrin repeat domain of the zDHHC17 S-acyltransferase.
28882895|a|zDHHC S-acyl-transferases are enzymes catalyzing protein S-acylation, a common post-translational modification on proteins frequently affecting their membrane targeting and trafficking. The ankyrin-repeat (AR) domain of zDHHC17 (HIP14) and zDHHC13 (HIP14L) S-acyltransferases, which is involved in both substrate recruitment and S-acylation-independent functions, was recently shown to bind at least six proteins, by specific recognition of a consensus sequence in them. To further refine the rules governing binding to the AR of zDHHC17, we employed peptide arrays based on zDHHC AR-binding motif (zDABM) sequences of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and cysteine string protein alpha (CSPa). Quantitative comparisons of the binding preferences of 400 peptides allowed us to construct a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) for zDHHC17 AR binding, with which we predicted and subsequently validated many putative zDHHC17 interactors. We identified 95 human zDABM sequences with unexpected versatility in amino-acid usage; these sequences were distributed among 90 proteins, of which 62 have not been previously implicated in zDHHC17/13 binding. These zDABM-containing proteins included all family members of the SNAP25, sprouty, cornifelin, ankyrin, and SLAIN-motif containing families; seven endogenous Gag polyproteins sharing the same binding sequence; and several proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, cell communication, and regulation of signaling. A dozen of the zDABM-containing proteins had more than one zDABM sequence, while isoform-specific binding to the AR of zDHHC17 was identified for the Ena/VASP-like protein. The large number of zDABM sequences within the human proteome suggests that zDHHC17 may be an interaction hub regulating many cellular processes.

28883039|t|Disease-associated mutations in human BICD2 hyperactivate motility of dynein-dynactin.
28883039|a|Bicaudal D2 (BICD2) joins dynein with dynactin into a ternary complex (termed DDB) capable of processive movement. Point mutations in the BICD2 gene have been identified in patients with a dominant form of spinal muscular atrophy, but how these mutations cause disease is unknown. To investigate this question, we have developed in vitro motility assays with purified DDB and BICD2's membrane vesicle partner, the GTPase Rab6a. Rab6a-GTP, either in solution or bound to artificial liposomes, released BICD2 from an autoinhibited state and promoted robust dynein-dynactin transport. In these assays, BICD2 mutants showed an enhanced ability to form motile DDB complexes. Increased retrograde transport by BICD2 mutants also was observed in cells using an inducible organelle transport assay. When overexpressed in rat hippocampal neurons, the hyperactive BICD2 mutants decreased neurite growth. Our results reveal that dominant mutations in BICD2 hyperactivate DDB motility and suggest that an imbalance of minus versus plus end-directed microtubule motility in neurons may underlie spinal muscular atrophy.

28961247|t|Functional divergence of chloroplast Cpn60a subunits during Arabidopsis embryo development.
28961247|a|Chaperonins are a class of molecular chaperones that assist in the folding and assembly of a wide range of substrates. In plants, chloroplast chaperonins are composed of two different types of subunits, Cpn60a and Cpn60b, and duplication of Cpn60a and Cpn60b genes occurs in a high proportion of plants. However, the importance of multiple Cpn60a and Cpn60b genes in plants is poorly understood. In this study, we found that loss-of-function of CPNA2 (AtCpn60a2), a gene encoding the minor Cpn60a subunit in Arabidopsis thaliana, resulted in arrested embryo development at the globular stage, whereas the other AtCpn60a gene encoding the dominant Cpn60a subunit, CPNA1 (AtCpn60a1), mainly affected embryonic cotyledon development at the torpedo stage and thereafter. Further studies demonstrated that CPNA2 can form a functional chaperonin with CPNB2 (AtCpn60b2) and CPNB3 (AtCpn60b3), while the functional partners of CPNA1 are CPNB1 (AtCpn60b1) and CPNB2. We also revealed that the functional chaperonin containing CPNA2 could assist the folding of a specific substrate, KASI (b-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I), and that the KASI protein level was remarkably reduced due to loss-of-function of CPNA2. Furthermore, the reduction in the KASI protein level was shown to be the possible cause for the arrest of cpna2 embryos. Our findings indicate that the two Cpn60a subunits in Arabidopsis play different roles during embryo development through forming distinct chaperonins with specific AtCpn60b to assist the folding of particular substrates, thus providing novel insights into functional divergence of Cpn60a subunits in plants.

29040309|t|Targeted Pth4-expressing cell ablation impairs skeletal mineralization in zebrafish.
29040309|a|Skeletal development and mineralization are essential processes driven by the coordinated action of neural signals, circulating molecules and local factors. Our previous studies revealed that the novel neuropeptide Pth4, synthesized by hypothalamic cells, was involved in bone metabolism via phosphate regulation in adult zebrafish. Here, we investigate the role of pth4 during skeletal development using single-cell resolution, two-photon laser ablation of Pth4:eGFP-expressing cells and confocal imaging in vivo. Using a stable transgenic Pth4:eGFP zebrafish line, we identify Pth4:eGFP-expressing cells as post-mitotic neurons. After targeted ablation of eGFP-expressing cells in the hypothalamus, the experimental larvae exhibited impaired mineralization of the craniofacial bones whereas cartilage development was normal. In addition to a decrease in pth4 transcript levels, we noted altered expression of phex and entpd5, genes associated with phosphate homeostasis and mineralization, as well as a delay in the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers such as sp7 and sparc. Taken together, these results suggest that Pth4-expressing hypothalamic neurons participate in the regulation of bone metabolism, possibly through regulating phosphate balance during zebrafish development.

29040339|t|Protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22 is dispensable for dendritic cell antigen processing and promotion of T-cell activation by dendritic cells.
29040339|a|The PTPN22R620W single nucleotide polymorphism increases the risk of developing multiple autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. PTPN22 is highly expressed in antigen presenting cells (APCs) where the expression of the murine disease associated variant orthologue (Ptpn22R619W) is reported to dysregulate pattern recognition receptor signalling in dendritic cells (DCs) and promote T-cell proliferation. Because T-cell activation is dependent on DC antigen uptake, degradation and presentation, we analysed the efficiency of these functions in splenic and GM-CSF bone marrow derived DC from wild type (WT), Ptpn22-/- or Ptpn22R619W mutant mice. Results indicated no differential ability of DCs to uptake antigen via macropinocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis. Antigen degradation and presentation was also equal as was WT T-cell conjugate formation and subsequent T-cell proliferation. Despite the likely presence of multiple phosphatase-regulated pathways in the antigen uptake, processing and presentation pathways that we investigated, we observed that Ptpn22 and the R619W autoimmune associated variant were dispensable. These important findings indicate that under non-inflammatory conditions there is no requirement for Ptpn22 in DC dependent antigen uptake and T-cell activation. Our findings reveal that perturbations in antigen uptake and processing, a fundamental pathway determining adaptive immune responses, are unlikely to provide a mechanism for the risk associated with the Ptpn22 autoimmune associated polymorphism.

29045486|t|Thiamine deficiency activates hypoxia inducible factor-1a to facilitate pro-apoptotic responses in mouse primary astrocytes.
29045486|a|Thiamine is an essential enzyme cofactor required for proper metabolic function and maintenance of metabolism and energy production in the brain. In developed countries, thiamine deficiency (TD) is most often manifested following chronic alcohol consumption leading to impaired mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation and excitotoxicity. These biochemical lesions result in apoptotic cell death in both neurons and astrocytes. Comparable histological injuries in patients with hypoxia/ischemia and TD have been described in the thalamus and mammillary bodies, suggesting a congruency between the cellular responses to these stresses. Consistent with hypoxia/ischemia, TD stabilizes and activates Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1a (HIF-1a) under physiological oxygen levels. However, the role of TD-induced HIF-1a in neurological injury is currently unknown. Using Western blot analysis and RT-PCR, we have demonstrated that TD induces HIF-1a expression and activity in primary mouse astrocytes. We observed a time-dependent increase in mRNA and protein expression of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory HIF-1a target genes MCP1, BNIP3, Nix and Noxa during TD. We also observed apoptotic cell death in TD as demonstrated by PI/Annexin V staining, TUNEL assay, and Cell Death ELISA. Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1a activity using YC1 and thiamine repletion both reduced expression of pro-apoptotic HIF-1a target genes and apoptotic cell death in TD. These results demonstrate that induction of HIF-1a mediated transcriptional up-regulation of pro-apoptotic/inflammatory signaling contributes to astrocyte cell death during thiamine deficiency.

29049388|t|An inducible mouse model of podocin-mutation-related nephrotic syndrome.
29049388|a|Mutations in the NPHS2 gene, encoding podocin, cause hereditary nephrotic syndrome. The most common podocin mutation, R138Q, is associated with early disease onset and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease. Knock-in mice carrying a R140Q mutation, the mouse analogue of human R138Q, show developmental arrest of podocytes and lethal renal failure at neonatal age. Here we created a conditional podocin knock-in model named NPHS2 R140Q/-, using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase, which permits to study the effects of the mutation in postnatal life. Within the first week of R140Q hemizygosity induction the animals developed proteinuria, which peaked after 4-5 weeks. Subsequently the animals developed progressive renal failure, with a median survival time of 12 (95% CI: 11-13) weeks. Foot process fusion was observed within one week, progressing to severe and global effacement in the course of the disease. The number of podocytes per glomerulus gradually diminished to 18% compared to healthy controls 12-16 weeks after induction. The fraction of segmentally sclerosed glomeruli was 25%, 85% and 97% at 2, 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis was present at later disease stage and was correlated quantitatively with the level of proteinuria at early disease stages. While R140Q podocin mRNA expression was elevated, protein abundance was reduced by more than 50% within one week following induction. Whereas miRNA21 expression persistently increased during the first 4 weeks, miRNA-193a expression peaked 2 weeks after induction. In conclusion, the inducible R140Q-podocin mouse model is an auspicious model of the most common genetic cause of human nephrotic syndrome, with a spontaneous disease course strongly reminiscent of the human disorder. This model constitutes a valuable tool to test the efficacy of novel pharmacological interventions aimed to improve podocyte function and viability and attenuate proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal failure.

29059224|t|Netrin-1 is a novel regulator of vascular endothelial function in diabetes.
29059224|a|BACKGROUND: Netrin-1, a secreted laminin-like protein identified as an axon guidance molecule, has been shown to be of critical importance in the cardiovascular system. Recent studies have revealed pro-angiogenic, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties of netrin-1 as well as cardioprotective actions against myocardial injury in diabetic mice. AIM: To examine the role of netrin-1 in diabetes-and high glucose (HG)-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) using netrin-1 transgenic mice (Tg3) and cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). MAIN OUTCOME: Overexpression of netrin-1 prevented diabetes-induced VED in aorta from diabetic mice and netrin-1 treatment attenuated HG-induced impairment of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) function in BAECs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiments were performed in Tg3 and littermate control (WT) mice rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ) and in BAECs treated with HG (25 mmol/L). Levels of netrin-1 and its receptor DCC, markers of inflammation and apoptosis and vascular function were assessed in aortas from diabetic and non-diabetic Tg3 and WT mice. Vascular netrin-1 in WT mice was reduced under diabetic conditions. Aortas from non-diabetic Tg3 and WT mice showed similar maximum endothelium-dependent relaxation (MEDR) (83% and 87%, respectively). MEDR was markedly impaired in aorta from diabetic WT mice (51%). This effect was significantly blunted in Tg3 diabetic aortas (70%). Improved vascular relaxation in Tg3 diabetic mice was associated with increased levels of phospho-ERK1/2 and reduced levels of oxidant stress, NFkB, COX-2, p16INK4A, cleaved caspase-3 and p16 and p53 mRNA. Netrin-1 treatment prevented the HG-induced decrease in NO production and elevation of oxidative stress and apoptosis in BAECs. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes decreases aortic levels of netrin-1. However, overexpression of netrin-1 attenuates diabetes-induced VED and limits the reduction of NO levels, while increasing expression of p-ERK1/2, and suppressing oxidative stress and inflammatory and apoptotic processes. Enhancement of netrin-1 function may be a useful therapeutic means for preventing vascular dysfunction in diabetes.

29065170|t|Zinc-finger protein 418 overexpression protects against cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.
29065170|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigated the effect and mechanism of zinc-finger protein 418 (ZNF418) on cardiac hypertrophy caused by aortic banding (AB), phenylephrine (PE) or angiotensin II (Ang II) in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: The expression of ZNF418 in hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy mice, as well as in Ang II- or PE-induced hypertrophic primary cardiomyocytes was detected by western blotting. Then, the expression of ZNF418 was up-regulated or down-regulated in AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy mice and Ang II -induced hypertrophic primary cardiomyocytes. The hypertrophic responses and fibrosis were evaluated by echocardiography and histological analysis. The mRNA levels of hypertrophy markers and fibrotic markers were detected by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, the phosphorylation and total levels of c-Jun were measured by western blotting. RESULTS: ZNF418 was markedly down-regulated in hearts of cardiac hypertrophy and hypertrophic primary cardiomyocytes. Down-regulated ZNF418 exacerbated the myocyte size and fibrosis, moreover increased the mRNA levels of ANP, BNP, b-MHC, MCIP1.4, collagen 1a, collagen III, MMP-2 and fibronection in hearts of AB-treated ZNF418 knockout mice or Ang II-treated cardiomyocytes with AdshZNF418. Conversely, these hypertrophic responses were reduced in the ZNF418 transgenic (TG) mice treated by AB and the AdZNF418-transfected primary cardiomyocytes treated by Ang II. Additionally, the deficiency of ZNF418 enhanced the phosphorylation level of c-jun, and overexpression of ZNF418 suppressed the phosphorylation level of c-jun in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSION: ZNF418 maybe attenuate hypertrophic responses by inhibiting the activity of c-jun/AP-1.

12461077|t|ICSBP is essential for the development of mouse type I interferon-producing cells and for the generation and activation of CD8alpha(+) dendritic cells.
12461077|a|Interferon (IFN) consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP) is a transcription factor playing a critical role in the regulation of lineage commitment, especially in myeloid cell differentiation. In this study, we have characterized the phenotype and activation pattern of subsets of dendritic cells (DCs) in ICSBP(-/-) mice. Remarkably, the recently identified mouse IFN-producing cells (mIPCs) were absent in all lymphoid organs from ICSBP(-/-) mice, as revealed by lack of CD11c(low)B220(+)Ly6C(+)CD11b(-) cells. In parallel, CD11c(+) cells isolated from ICSBP(-/-) spleens were unable to produce type I IFNs in response to viral stimulation. ICSBP(-/-) mice also displayed a marked reduction of the DC subset expressing the CD8alpha marker (CD8alpha(+) DCs) in spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus. Moreover, ICSBP(-/-) CD8alpha(+) DCs exhibited a markedly impaired phenotype when compared with WT DCs. They expressed very low levels of costimulatory molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM]-1, CD40, CD80, CD86) and of the T cell area-homing chemokine receptor CCR7, whereas they showed higher levels of CCR2 and CCR6, as revealed by reverse transcription PCR. In addition, these cells were unable to undergo full phenotypic activation upon in vitro culture in presence of maturation stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide or poly (I:C), which paralleled with lack of Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 mRNA expression. Finally, cytokine expression pattern was also altered in ICSBP(-/-) DCs, as they did not express interleukin (IL)-12p40 or IL-15, but they displayed detectable IL-4 mRNA levels. On the whole, these results indicate that ICSBP is a crucial factor in the regulation of two possibly linked processes: (a) the development and activity of mIPCs, whose lack in ICSBP(-/-) mice may explain their high susceptibility to virus infections; (b) the generation and activation of CD8alpha(+) DCs, whose impairment in ICSBP(-/-) mice can be responsible for the defective generation of a Th1 type of immune response.

18248671|t|NF-kappa B genes have a major role in inflammatory breast cancer.
18248671|a|BACKGROUND: IBC (Inflammatory Breast cancer) is a rare form of breast cancer with a particular phenotype. New molecular targets are needed to improve the treatment of this rapidly fatal disease. Given the role of NF-kappaB-related genes in cell proliferation, invasiveness, angiogenesis and inflammation, we postulated that they might be deregulated in IBC. METHODS: We measured the mRNA expression levels of 60 NF-kappaB-related genes by using real-time quantitative RT-PCR in a well-defined series of 35 IBCs, by comparison with 22 stage IIB and III non inflammatory breast cancers. Twenty-four distant metastases of breast cancer served as "poor prognosis" breast tumor controls. RESULTS: Thirty-five (58%) of the 60 NF-kappaB-related genes were significantly upregulated in IBC compared with non IBC. The upregulated genes were NF-kappaB genes (NFKB1, RELA, IKBKG, NFKBIB, NFKB2, REL, CHUK), apoptosis genes (MCL1L, TNFAIP3/A20, GADD45B, FASLG, MCL1S, IER3L, TNFRSF10B/TRAILR2), immune response genes (CD40, CD48, TNFSF11/RANKL, TNFRSF11A/RANK, CCL2/MCP-1, CD40LG, IL15, GBP1), proliferation genes (CCND2, CCND3, CSF1R, CSF1, SOD2), tumor-promoting genes (CXCL12, SELE, TNC, VCAM1, ICAM1, PLAU/UPA) or angiogenesis genes (PTGS2/COX2, CXCL1/GRO1). Only two of these 35 genes (PTGS2/COX2 and CXCL1/GRO1)were also upregulated in breast cancer metastases. We identified a five-gene molecular signature that matched patient outcomes, consisting of IL8 and VEGF plus three NF-kappaB-unrelated genes that we had previously identified as prognostic markers in the same series of IBC. CONCLUSION: The NF-kappaB pathway appears to play a major role in IBC, possibly contributing to the unusual phenotype and aggressiveness of this form of breast cancer. Some upregulated NF-kappaB-related genes might serve as novel therapeutic targets in IBC.

18310445|t|Bone morphogenetic protein-4 interacts with activin and GnRH to modulate gonadotrophin secretion in LbetaT2 gonadotrophs.
18310445|a|We have shown previously that, in sheep primary pituitary cells, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP)-4 inhibits FSHbeta mRNA expression and FSH release. In contrast, in mouse LbetaT2 gonadotrophs, others have shown a stimulatory effect of BMPs on basal or activin-stimulated FSHbeta promoter-driven transcription. As a species comparison with our previous results, we used LbetaT2 cells to investigate the effects of BMP-4 on gonadotrophin mRNA and secretion modulated by activin and GnRH. BMP-4 alone had no effect on FSH production, but enhanced the activin+GnRH-induced stimulation of FSHbeta mRNA and FSH secretion, without any effect on follistatin mRNA. BMP-4 reduced LHbeta mRNA up-regulation in response to GnRH (+/-activin) and decreased GnRH receptor expression, which would favour FSH, rather than LH, synthesis and secretion. In contrast to sheep pituitary gonadotrophs, which express only BMP receptor types IA (BMPRIA) and II (BMPRII), LbetaT2 cells also express BMPRIB. Smad1/5 phosphorylation induced by BMP-4, indicating activation of BMP signalling, was the same whether BMP-4 was used alone or combined with activin+/-GnRH. We hypothesized that activin and/or GnRH pathways may be modulated by BMP-4, but neither the activin-stimulated phosphorylation of Smad2/3 nor the GnRH-induced ERK1/2 or cAMP response element-binding phosphorylation were modified. However, the GnRH-induced activation of p38 MAPK was decreased by BMP-4. This was associated with increased FSHbeta mRNA levels and FSH secretion, but decreased LHbeta mRNA levels. These results confirm 1. BMPs as important modulators of activin and/or GnRH-stimulated gonadotrophin synthesis and release and 2. important species differences in these effects, which could relate to differences in BMP receptor expression in gonadotrophs.

18593936|t|Curcumin decreases specificity protein expression in bladder cancer cells.
18593936|a|Curcumin is the active component of tumeric, and this polyphenolic compound has been extensively investigated as an anticancer drug that modulates multiple pathways and genes. In this study, 10 to 25 micromol/L curcumin inhibited 253JB-V and KU7 bladder cancer cell growth, and this was accompanied by induction of apoptosis and decreased expression of the proapoptotic protein survivin and the angiogenic proteins vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1). Because expression of survivin, VEGF, and VEGFR1 are dependent on specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors, we also investigated the effects of curcumin on Sp protein expression as an underlying mechanism for the apoptotic and antiangiogenic activity of this compound. The results show that curcumin induced proteasome-dependent down-regulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in 253JB-V and KU7 cells. Moreover, using RNA interference with small inhibitory RNAs for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, we observed that curcumin-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent genes, such as bcl-2, survivin, and cyclin D1, was also due, in part, to loss of Sp proteins. Curcumin also decreased bladder tumor growth in athymic nude mice bearing KU7 cells as xenografts and this was accompanied by decreased Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 protein levels in tumors. These results show for the first time that one of the underlying mechanisms of action of curcumin as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent is due, in part, to decreased expression of Sp transcription factors in bladder cancer cells.

18783612|t|The Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) network in HEC-1-A endometrial carcinoma cells suggests the carcinogenic potential of dys-regulated KLF9 expression.
18783612|a|BACKGROUND: Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) is a transcriptional regulator of uterine endometrial cell proliferation, adhesion and differentiation; processes essential for pregnancy success and which are subverted during tumorigenesis. The network of endometrial genes controlled by KLF9 is largely unknown. Over-expression of KLF9 in the human endometrial cancer cell line HEC-1-A alters cell morphology, proliferative indices, and differentiation, when compared to KLF9 under-expressing HEC-1-A cells. This cell line provides a unique model for identifying KLF9 downstream gene targets and signaling pathways. METHODS: HEC-1-A sub-lines differing in relative levels of KLF9 were subjected to microarray analysis to identify differentially-regulated RNAs. RESULTS: KLF9 under-expression induced twenty four genes. The KLF9-suppressed mRNAs encode protein participants in: aldehyde metabolism (AKR7A2, ALDH1A1); regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility (e.g., ANK3, ITGB8); cellular detoxification (SULT1A1, ABCC4); cellular signaling (e.g., ACBD3, FZD5, RAB25, CALB1); and transcriptional regulation (PAX2, STAT1). Sixty mRNAs were more abundant in KLF9 over-expressing sub-lines. The KLF9-induced mRNAs encode proteins which participate in: regulation and function of the actin cytoskeleton (COTL1, FSCN1, FXYD5, MYO10); cell adhesion, extracellular matrix and basement membrane formation (e.g., AMIGO2, COL4A1, COL4A2, LAMC2, NID2); transport (CLIC4); cellular signaling (e.g., BCAR3, MAPKAPK3); transcriptional regulation [e.g., KLF4, NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor), RXRalpha], growth factor/cytokine actions (SLPI, BDNF); and membrane-associated proteins and receptors (e.g., CXCR4, PTCH1). In addition, the abundance of mRNAs that encode hypothetical proteins (KLF9-inhibited: C12orf29 and C1orf186; KLF9-induced: C10orf38 and C9orf167) were altered by KLF9 expression. Human endometrial tumors of high tumor grade had decreased KLF9 mRNA abundance. CONCLUSION: KLF9 influences the expression of uterine epithelial genes through mechanisms likely involving its transcriptional activator and repressor functions and which may underlie altered tumor biology with aberrant KLF9 expression.

19046382|t|A chemical compound commonly used to inhibit PKR, {8-(imidazol-4-ylmethylene)-6H-azolidino[5,4-g] benzothiazol-7-one}, protects neurons by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase.
19046382|a|Activation of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. We find that a compound widely used as a pharmacological inhibitor of this enzyme, referred to as PKR inhibitor (PKRi), {8-(imidazol-4-ylmethylene)-6H-azolidino[5,4-g]benzothiazol-7-one}, protects against the death of cultured cerebellar granule and cortical neurons. PKRi also prevents striatal neurodegeneration and improves behavioral outcomes in a chemically induced mouse model of Huntington's disease. Surprisingly, PKRi fails to block the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, a downstream target of PKR, and does not reduce the autophosphorylation of PKR enzyme immunoprecipitated from neurons. Furthermore, neurons lacking PKR are fully protected from apoptosis by PKRi, demonstrating that neuroprotection by this compound is not mediated by PKR inhibition. Using in vitro kinase assays we investigated whether PKRi affects any other protein kinase. These analyses demonstrated that PKRi has no major inhibitory effect on pro-apoptotic kinases such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinases, the p38 MAP kinases and the death-associated protein kinases, or on other kinases including c-Raf, MEK1, MKK6 and MKK7. PKRi does, however, inhibit the activity of certain cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), including CDK1, CDK2 and CDK5 both in vitro and in low potassium-treated neurons. Consistent with its inhibitory action on mitotic CDKs, the treatment of HT-22 and HEK293T cell lines with PKRi sharply reduces the rate of cell cycle progression. Taken together with the established role of CDK activation in the promotion of neurodegeneration, our results suggest that PKRi exerts its neuroprotective action by inhibiting CDK.

19201842|t|Gammadelta T lymphocyte homeostasis is negatively regulated by beta2-microglobulin.
19201842|a|Successful application of gammadelta T cells in adoptive cell therapies depends upon our ability to maintain these cells in vivo. Using an adoptive transfer model to study lymphopenia-induced homeostatic expansion, we show that CD8(+) and NK1.1(+) gammadelta T cell subsets are differentially regulated. While CD8(+) gammadelta T cells have an early and sustained advantage following transfer into TCRbeta(-/-)/delta(-/-) mice, NK1.1(+) gammadelta T cells proliferate slowly and are maintained at low numbers. The advantage of the CD8(+) subset could not be explained by increased bcl-2 or cytokine receptor expression but did correlate with Vgamma4(+) and Vdelta5(+) expression. Despite the role of CD8 in MHC class I recognition by alphabeta T cells, beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m)-associated MHC class I molecules were not required for CD8(+) gammadelta T cell homeostatic expansion. Surprisingly, all gammadelta T cells, including the CD8(+) subset, exhibited enhanced proliferation following adoptive transfer into Rag1(-/-)/beta(2)m(-/-) compared with Rag1(-/-) recipients. This effect was most notable for the NK1.1(+) subset, which expresses high levels of NKG2A/CD94 and Ly49. Although expression of these inhibitory receptors correlated with poor homeostatic expansion in the presence of beta(2)m, gammadelta T cell homeostatic proliferation in TCRbeta(-/-)/delta(-/-) mice was not altered in the presence of Ly49C/I- and NKG2-blocking Abs. While the mechanism by which beta(2)m negatively regulates gammadelta T cell homeostasis remains to be determined, this observation is unique to gammadelta T cells and confirms that multiple mechanisms are in place to maintain strict regulation of both the size and the composition of the gammadelta T cell pool.

19306381|t|Neuregulin-1 beta and neuregulin-1 alpha differentially affect the migration and invasion of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells.
19306381|a|Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the most common malignancy associated with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). These Schwann cell lineage-derived sarcomas aggressively invade adjacent nerve and soft tissue, frequently precluding surgical resection. Little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior. We have shown that MPNSTs express neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta isoforms, which promote Schwann cell migration during development, and NRG-1 alpha isoforms, whose effects on Schwann cells are poorly understood. Hypothesizing that NRG-1 beta and/or NRG-1 alpha promote MPNST invasion, we found that NRG-1 beta promoted MPNST migration in a substrate-specific manner, markedly enhancing migration on laminin but not on collagen type I or fibronectin. The NRG-1 receptors erbB3 and erbB4 were present in MPNST invadopodia (processes mediating invasion), partially colocalized with focal adhesion kinase and the laminin receptor beta(1)-integrin and coimmunoprecipitated with beta(1)-integrin. NRG-1 beta stimulated human and murine MPNST cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in three-dimensional migration assays, acting as a chemotactic factor. Both baseline and NRG-1 beta-induced migration were erbB-dependent and required the action of MEK 1/2, SAPK/JNK, PI-3 kinase, Src family kinases and ROCK-I/II. In contrast, NRG-1 alpha had no effect on the migration and invasion of some MPNST lines and inhibited the migration of others. While NRG-1 beta potently and persistently activated Erk 1/2, SAPK/JNK, Akt and Src family kinases, NRG-1 alpha did not activate Akt and activated these other kinases with kinetics distinct from those evident in NRG-1 beta-stimulated cells. These findings suggest that NRG-1 beta enhances MPNST migration and that NRG-1 beta and NRG-1 alpha differentially modulate this process.

19414636|t|Sca-1+ stem cell survival and engraftment in the infarcted heart: dual role for preconditioning-induced connexin-43.
19414636|a|BACKGROUND: We report that elevated connexin-43 (Cx-43) in stem cells preconditioned with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is cytoprotective and reprograms the cells for cardiomyogenic differentiation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sca-1+ cells were preconditioned with 100 nmol/L IGF-1 for 30 minutes followed by 8 hours of oxygen glucose deprivation to assess the cytoprotective effects of preconditioning. LDH release assay, cytochrome c release, and mitochondrial membrane potential assay showed improved survival of preconditioned Sca-1+ cells under oxygen glucose deprivation compared with nonpreconditioned Sca-1+ cells via PI3K/Akt-dependent caspase-3 downregulation. We observed PI3K/Akt-dependent upregulation of cardiac-specific markers including MEF-2c (2.5-fold), GATA4 (3.1-fold), and Cx-43 (3.5-fold). Cx-43 inhibition with specific RNA interference reduced cell survival under oxygen glucose deprivation and after transplantation. In vivo studies were performed in a female rat model of acute myocardial infarction (n=78). Animals were grouped to receive intramyocardially 70 microL Dulbecco modified Eagles medium without cells (group 1) or containing male 1 x 10(6) nonpreconditioned Sca-1+ cells (group 2) or preconditioned Sca-1+ (group 3) cells labeled with PKH26. Survival of the preconditioned Sca-1+ cells was 5.5-fold higher in group 3 compared with group 2 at 7 days after transplantation. Confocal imaging after actinin and Cx-43 specific immunostaining showed extensive engraftment and myogenic differentiation of preconditioned Sca-1+ cells. Compared with group 2, group 3 showed increased blood vessel density (22.3+/-1.7 per microscopic field; P<0.0001) and attenuated infarction size (23.3+/-3.6%; P=0.002). Heart function indices including ejection fraction (56.2+/-3.5; P=0.029) and fractional shortening (24.3+/-2.1; P=0.03) were improved in group 3 compared with group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Preconditioning with IGF-1 reprograms Sca-1+ for prosurvival signaling and cardiomyogenic differentiation with an important role for Cx-43 in this process.

19427096|t|Hematopoietic- and neurologic-expressed sequence 1 (Hn1) depletion in B16.F10 melanoma cells promotes a differentiated phenotype that includes increased melanogenesis and cell cycle arrest.
19427096|a|The Hematopoietic- and neurologic-expressed sequence 1 (Hn1) gene encodes a small protein that is highly conserved among species. Hn1 expression is upregulated in regenerating neural tissues, including the axotomized adult rodent facial motor nerve and dedifferentiating retinal pigment epithelial cells of the Japanese newt. It is also expressed in numerous tissues during embryonic development as well as in regions of the adult brain that exhibit high plasticity. Hn1 has also been reported as a marker for human ovarian carcinoma and it is expressed in high-grade human gliomas. This study was directed toward understanding the function of Hn1 in a murine melanoma cell line. Hn1 mRNA and protein were identified in B16.F10 cells and in tumors formed from these cells. Inhibition of Hn1 protein expression with siRNA increased melanogenesis. Hn1-depleted cells expressed higher levels of the melanogenic proteins tyrosinase and Trp2 and an increased interaction between actin and Rab27a. The in vitro cell growth rate of Hn1-depleted cells was significantly reduced due to G1/S cell cycle arrest. This was consistent with a reduction in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein as well as lower levels of p27 and increased expression of p21. Decreased expression of c-Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, was also detected in the Hn1-depleted cells, however HGF-dependent stimulation of phosphorylated-ERK was unaffected. Hn1 depletion also led to increased basal levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, while basal ERK phosphorylation was reduced. Moreover, Hn1-depleted cells had reduced expression of transcription factors MITF and USF-1, and increased expression of TFE3. These data, coupled with reports on Hn1 expression in regeneration and development, suggest that Hn1 functions as a suppressor of differentiation in cells undergoing repair or proliferation.

19672298|t|A novel combination of factors, termed SPIE, which promotes dopaminergic neuron differentiation from human embryonic stem cells.
19672298|a|BACKGROUND: Stromal-Derived Inducing Activity (SDIA) is one of the most efficient methods of generating dopaminergic (DA) neurons from embryonic stem cells (ESC). DA neuron induction can be achieved by co-culturing ESC with the mouse stromal cell lines PA6 or MS5. The molecular nature of this effect, which has been termed "SDIA" is so far unknown. Recently, we found that factors secreted by PA6 cells provided lineage-specific instructions to induce DA differentiation of human ESC (hESC). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we compared PA6 cells to various cell lines lacking the SDIA effect, and employed genome expression analysis to identify differentially-expressed signaling molecules. Among the factors highly expressed by PA6 cells, and known to be associated with CNS development, were stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), pleiotrophin (PTN), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), and ephrin B1 (EFNB1). When these four factors, the combination of which was termed SPIE, were applied to hESC, they induced differentiation to TH-positive neurons in vitro. RT-PCR and western blot analysis confirmed the expression of midbrain specific markers, including engrailed 1, Nurr1, Pitx3, and dopamine transporter (DAT) in cultures influenced by these four molecules. Electrophysiological recordings showed that treatment of hESC with SPIE induced differentiation of neurons that were capable of generating action potentials and forming functional synaptic connections. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of SDF-1, PTN, IGF2, and EFNB1 mimics the DA phenotype-inducing property of SDIA and was sufficient to promote differentiation of hESC to functional midbrain DA neurons. These findings provide a method for differentiating hESC to form DA neurons, without a requirement for the use of animal-derived cell lines or products.

19672862|t|Protein kinase C alpha-dependent signaling mediates endometrial cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis.
19672862|a|Endometrial cancer is the most common invasive gynecologic malignancy, yet molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying its etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly characterized. We sought to define a functional role for the protein kinase C (PKC) isoform, PKCalpha, in an established cell model of endometrial adenocarcinoma. Ishikawa cells depleted of PKCalpha protein grew slower, formed fewer colonies in anchorage-independent growth assays and exhibited impaired xenograft tumor formation in nude mice. Consistent with impaired growth, PKCalpha knockdown increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21(Cip1/WAF1) (p21) and p27(Kip1) (p27). Despite the absence of functional phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein in Ishikawa cells, PKCalpha knockdown reduced Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 and concomitantly inhibited phosphorylation of the Akt target, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). PKCalpha knockdown also resulted in decreased basal ERK phosphorylation and attenuated ERK activation following EGF stimulation. p21 and p27 expression was not increased by treatment of Ishikawa cells with ERK and Akt inhibitors, suggesting that PKCalpha regulates CDK expression independently of Akt and ERK. Immunohistochemical analysis of Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma revealed aberrant PKCalpha expression, with foci of elevated PKCalpha staining, not observed in normal endometrium. These studies demonstrate a critical role for PKCalpha signaling in endometrial tumorigenesis by regulating expression of CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 and activation of Akt and ERK-dependent proliferative pathways. Thus, targeting PKCalpha may provide novel therapeutic options in endometrial tumors.

19825989|t|H3 histamine receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase Calpha inhibits the growth of cholangiocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo.
19825989|a|Histamine regulates functions via four receptors (HRH1, HRH2, HRH3, and HRH4). The d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))/Ca(2+)/protein kinase C (PKC)/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulates cholangiocarcinoma growth. We evaluated the role of HRH3 in the regulation of cholangiocarcinoma growth. Expression of HRH3 in intrahepatic and extrahepatic cell lines, normal cholangiocytes, and human tissue arrays was measured. In Mz-ChA-1 cells stimulated with (R)-(alpha)-(-)-methylhistamine dihydrobromide (RAMH), we measured (a) cell growth, (b) IP(3) and cyclic AMP levels, and (c) phosphorylation of PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase isoforms. Localization of PKCalpha was visualized by immunofluorescence in cell smears and immunoblotting for PKCalpha in cytosol and membrane fractions. Following knockdown of PKCalpha, Mz-ChA-1 cells were stimulated with RAMH before evaluating cell growth and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 phosphorylation. In vivo experiments were done in BALB/c nude mice. Mice were treated with saline or RAMH for 44 days and tumor volume was measured. Tumors were excised and evaluated for proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of PKCalpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, VEGF receptor 2, and VEGF receptor 3. HRH3 expression was found in all cells. RAMH inhibited the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells. RAMH increased IP(3) levels and PKCalpha phosphorylation and decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. RAMH induced a shift in the localization of PKCalpha expression from the cytosolic domain into the membrane region of Mz-ChA-1 cells. Silencing of PKCalpha prevented RAMH inhibition of Mz-ChA-1 cell growth and ablated RAMH effects on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In vivo, RAMH decreased tumor growth and expression of VEGF and its receptors; PKCalpha expression was increased. RAMH inhibits cholangiocarcinoma growth by PKCalpha-dependent ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Modulation of PKCalpha by histamine receptors may be important in regulating cholangiocarcinoma growth.

20011520|t|Sox2 is required for maintenance and differentiation of bronchiolar Clara, ciliated, and goblet cells.
20011520|a|The bronchioles of the murine lung are lined by a simple columnar epithelium composed of ciliated, Clara, and goblet cells that together mediate barrier function, mucociliary clearance and innate host defense, vital for pulmonary homeostasis. In the present work, we demonstrate that expression of Sox2 in Clara cells is required for the differentiation of ciliated, Clara, and goblet cells that line the bronchioles of the postnatal lung. The gene was selectively deleted in Clara cells utilizing Scgb1a1-Cre, causing the progressive loss of Sox2 in the bronchioles during perinatal and postnatal development. The rate of bronchiolar cell proliferation was decreased and associated with the formation of an undifferentiated, cuboidal-squamous epithelium lacking the expression of markers of Clara cells (Scgb1a1), ciliated cells (FoxJ1 and alpha-tubulin), and goblet cells (Spdef and Muc5AC). By adulthood, bronchiolar cell numbers were decreased and Sox2 was absent in extensive regions of the bronchiolar epithelium, at which time residual Sox2 expression was primarily restricted to selective niches of CGRP staining neuroepithelial cells. Allergen-induced goblet cell differentiation and mucus production was absent in the respiratory epithelium lacking Sox2. In vitro, Sox2 activated promoter-luciferase reporter constructs for differentiation markers characteristic of Clara, ciliated, and goblet cells, Scgb1a1, FoxJ1, and Agr2, respectively. Sox2 physically interacted with Smad3 and inhibited TGF-beta1/Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity in vitro, a pathway that negatively regulates proliferation. Sox2 is required for proliferation and differentiation of Clara cells that serve as the progenitor cells from which Clara, ciliated, and goblet cells are derived.

20105280|t|Activated Ras alters lens and corneal development through induction of distinct downstream targets.
20105280|a|BACKGROUND: Mammalian Ras genes regulate diverse cellular processes including proliferation and differentiation and are frequently mutated in human cancers. Tumor development in response to Ras activation varies between different tissues and the molecular basis for these variations are poorly understood. The murine lens and cornea have a common embryonic origin and arise from adjacent regions of the surface ectoderm. Activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway induces the corneal epithelial cells to proliferate and the lens epithelial cells to exit the cell cycle. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the differential responses of these two related tissues have not been defined. We have generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active version of human H-Ras in their lenses and corneas. RESULTS: Ras transgenic lenses and corneal epithelial cells showed increased proliferation with concomitant increases in cyclin D1 and D2 expression. This initial increase in proliferation is sustained in the cornea but not in the lens epithelial cells. Coincidentally, cdk inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 were upregulated in the Ras transgenic lenses but not in the corneas. Phospho-Erk1 and Erk2 levels were elevated in the lens but not in the cornea and Spry 1 and Spry 2, negative regulators of Ras-Raf-Erk signaling, were upregulated more in the corneal than in the lens epithelial cells. Both lens and corneal differentiation programs were sensitive to Ras activation. Ras transgenic embryos showed a distinctive alteration in the architecture of the lens pit. Ras activation, though sufficient for upregulation of Prox1, a transcription factor critical for cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation, is not sufficient for induction of terminal fiber differentiation. Expression of Keratin 12, a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, was reduced in the Ras transgenic corneas. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that Ras activation a) induces distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea resulting in distinct cellular responses and b) is sufficient for initiation but not completion of lens fiber differentiation.

20105310|t|Association of adipocyte genes with ASP expression: a microarray analysis of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue in morbidly obese subjects.
20105310|a|BACKGROUND: Prevalence of obesity is increasing to pandemic proportions. However, obese subjects differ in insulin resistance, adipokine production and co-morbidities. Based on fasting plasma analysis, obese subjects were grouped as Low Acylation Stimulating protein (ASP) and Triglyceride (TG) (LAT) vs High ASP and TG (HAT). Subcutaneous (SC) and omental (OM) adipose tissues (n = 21) were analysed by microarray, and biologic pathways in lipid metabolism and inflammation were specifically examined. METHODS: LAT and HAT groups were matched in age, obesity, insulin, and glucose, and had similar expression of insulin-related genes (InsR, IRS-1). ASP related genes tended to be increased in the HAT group and were correlated (factor B, adipsin, complement C3, p < 0.01 each). Differences between LAT and HAT group were almost exclusively in SC tissue, with little difference in OM tissue. Increased C5L2 (p < 0.01), an ASP receptor, in HAT suggests a compensatory ASP pathway, associated with increased TG storage. RESULTS: HAT adipose tissue demonstrated increased lipid related genes for storage (CD36, DGAT1, DGAT2, SCD1, FASN, and LPL), lipolysis (HSL, CES1, perilipin), fatty acid binding proteins (FABP1, FABP3) and adipocyte differentiation markers (CEBPalpha, CEBPbeta, PPARgamma). By contrast, oxidation related genes were decreased (AMPK, UCP1, CPT1, FABP7). HAT subjects had increased anti-inflammatory genes TGFB1, TIMP1, TIMP3, and TIMP4 while proinflammatory PIG7 and MMP2 were also significantly increased; all genes, p < 0.025. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the profile of C5L2 receptor, ASP gene expression and metabolic factors in adipose tissue from morbidly obese HAT subjects suggests a compensatory response associated with the increased plasma ASP and TG.

20203690|t|Activation of GPR30 inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells through sustained activation of Erk1/2, c-jun/c-fos-dependent upregulation of p21, and induction of G(2) cell-cycle arrest.
20203690|a|G-protein-coupled receptor-30 (GPR30) shows estrogen-binding affinity and mediates non-genomic signaling of estrogen to regulate cell growth. We here showed for the first time, in contrast to the reported promoting action of GPR30 on the growth of breast and ovarian cancer cells, that activation of GPR30 by the receptor-specific, non-estrogenic ligand G-1 inhibited the growth of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer (PCa) cells in vitro and PC-3 xenografts in vivo. However, G-1 elicited no growth or histological changes in the prostates of intact mice and did not inhibit growth in quiescent BPH-1, an immortalized benign prostatic epithelial cell line. Treatment of PC-3 cells with G-1 induced cell-cycle arrest at the G(2) phase and reduced the expression of G(2)-checkpoint regulators (cyclin-A2, cyclin-B1, cdc25c, and cdc2) and phosphorylation of their common transcriptional regulator NF-YA in PC-3 cells. With extensive use of siRNA-knockdown experiments and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 in this study, we dissected the mechanism underlying G-1-induced inhibition of PC-3 cell growth, which was mediated through GPR30, followed by sustained activation of Erk1/2 and a c-jun/c-fos-dependent upregulation of p21, resulting in the arrest of PC-3 growth at the G(2) phase. The discovery of this signaling pathway lays the foundation for future development of GPR30-based therapies for PCa.

20454457|t|HOXB13, a target of DNMT3B, is methylated at an upstream CpG island, and functions as a tumor suppressor in primary colorectal tumors.
20454457|a|BACKGROUND: A hallmark of cancer cells is hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGIs), which probably arises from upregulation of one or more DNA methyltransferases. The purpose of this study was to identify the targets of DNMT3B, an essential DNA methyltransferase in mammals, in colon cancer. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation with DNMT3B specific antibody followed by CGI microarray identified genes with or without CGIs, repeat elements and genomic contigs in RKO cells. ChIP-Chop analysis showed that the majority of the target genes including P16, DCC, DISC1, SLIT1, CAVEOLIN1, GNA11, TBX5, TBX18, HOXB13 and some histone variants, that harbor CGI in their promoters, were methylated in multiple colon cancer cell lines but not in normal colon epithelial cells. Further, these genes were reactivated in RKO cells after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA hypomethylating agent. COBRA showed that the CGIs encompassing the promoter and/or coding region of DCC, TBX5, TBX18, SLIT1 were methylated in primary colorectal tumors but not in matching normal colon tissues whereas GNA11 was methylated in both. MassARRAY analysis demonstrated that the CGI located approximately 4.5 kb upstream of HOXB13 +1 site was tumor-specifically hypermethylated in primary colorectal cancers and cancer cell lines. HOXB13 upstream CGI was partially hypomethylated in DNMT1(-/-) HCT cells but was almost methylation free in cells lacking both DNMT1 and DNMT3B. Analysis of tumor suppressor properties of two aberrantly methylated transcription factors, HOXB13 and TBX18, revealed that both inhibited growth and clonogenic survival of colon cancer cells in vitro, but only HOXB13 abolished tumor growth in nude mice. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report that identifies several important tumor suppressors and transcription factors as direct DNMT3B targets in colon cancer and as potential biomarkers for this cancer. Further, this study shows that methylation at an upstream CGI of HOXB13 is unique to colon cancer.

20554759|t|Forced homo- and heterodimerization of all gp130-type receptor complexes leads to constitutive ligand-independent signaling and cytokine-independent growth.
20554759|a|Naturally ligand independent constitutively active gp130 variants were described to be responsible for inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas. Recently, we genetically engineered a ligand-independent constitutively active gp130 variant based on homodimerization of Jun leucine zippers. Because also heterodimeric complexes within the gp130 family may have tumorigenic potential, we seek to generate ligand-independent constitutively active heterodimers for all known gp130-receptor complexes based on IL-15/IL-15R alpha-sushi fusion proteins. Ligand-independent heterodimerization of gp130 with WSX-1, LIFR, and OSMR and of OSMR with GPL led to constitutive, ligand-independent STAT1 and/or STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, these receptor combinations induced transcription of the STAT3 target genes c-myc and Pim-1 and factor-independent growth of stably transduced Ba/F3-gp130 cells. Here, we establish the IL-15/IL-15R alpha-sushi system as a new system to mimic constitutive and ligand-independent activation of homo- and heterodimeric receptor complexes, which might be applicable to other heterodimeric receptor families. A mutated IL-15 protein, which was still able to bind the IL-15R alpha-sushi domain, but not to beta- and gamma-receptor chains, in combination with the 2A peptide technology may be used to translate our in vitro data into the in vivo situation to assess the tumorigenic potential of gp130-heterodimeric receptor complexes.

20626887|t|The timing of perinatal hypoxia/ischemia events in term neonates: a retrospective autopsy study. HSPs, ORP-150 and COX2 are reliable markers to classify acute, perinatal events.
20626887|a|BACKGROUND: The understanding of the cellular responses implicated in perinatal brain damages and the characterization of the various mechanisms involved might open new horizons for understanding the time of onset of a brain hypoxic-ischemic lesion and for effective therapeutic strategies. METHODS: We performed an immunohistochemical investigation on brain and brainstem sections of 47 peripartum deaths. The gradation and localization of the expression of antibodies such as TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, HSPs, beta APP, anti-TrypH, GAP43, GFAP, COX2, ORP-150, could be correlated with an hypoxic-ischemic damage to document a significant correlation between response and the time of onset acute (</=8 hs) or non-acute (>/=8 hs </=48 hs). RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: In non-acute cases HSP70 reaction was prominent in the neuron cytoplasm, while in acute cases a mild reaction was evident in sporadic fields. HSP90 exhibited a similar pattern of positivity as HSP70. In acute group, ORP150 expressed an intense reaction showing a granular pattern in the cytoplasm of the neurons in the cortex of the infarcted areas. In non-acute group the positive reaction was more intense in astrocytes and less extended in neurons. COX2 reaction exhibited the strongest positive reaction in the neuronal cell bodies of acute cases, while a immunolabeling was prominent in the glial cytoplasm in the non-acute cases. CONCLUSIONS: Chaperones HSP70 and 90, ORP-150 reaction, and COX2 protein, have provided very interesting results. These results would suggest to the clinicians to extend the differential diagnosis of a too large perinatal hypoxic-ischemic insult category to delineate a more accurate chronological judgement.

20807568|t|Activation of the JNK signalling pathway by macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and dependence on CXCR4 and CD74.
20807568|a|c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and controls essential processes such as inflammation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. JNK signalling is triggered by extracellular signals such as cytokines and environmental stresses. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine with chemokine-like functions in leukocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis. MIF promotes MAPK signalling through ERK1/2, while it can either activate or inhibit JNK phosphorylation, depending on the cell type and underlying stimulation context. MIF activities are mediated by non-cognate interactions with the CXC chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4 or by ligation of CD74, which is the cell surface expressed form of the class II invariant chain. ERK1/2 signalling stimulated by MIF is dependent on CD74, but the receptor pathway involved in MIF activation of the JNK pathway is unknown. Here we comprehensively characterize the stimulatory effect of MIF on the canonical JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 pathway in fibroblasts and T cell lines and identify the upstream signalling components. Physiological concentrations of recombinant MIF triggered the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun and rapidly activated AP-1. In T cells, MIF-mediated activation of the JNK pathway led to upregulated gene expression of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL8. Activation of JNK signalling by MIF involved the upstream kinases PI3K and SRC and was found to be dependent on CXCR4 and CD74. Together, these data show that the CXCR4/CD74/SRC/PI3K axis mediates a rapid and transient activation of the JNK pathway as triggered by the inflammatory cytokine MIF in T cells and fibroblasts.

20821041|t|TLR1/2, TLR7, and TLR9 signals directly activate human peripheral blood naive and memory B cell subsets to produce cytokines, chemokines, and hematopoietic growth factors.
20821041|a|Recently, it has been reported that using multiple signals, murine and human B cells secrete several cytokines with pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties. We present the first comprehensive analysis of 24 cytokines, chemokines, and hematopoietic growth factors production by purified human peripheral blood B cells (CD19+), and naive (CD19+CD27-) and memory (CD19+CD27+) B cells in response to direct and exclusive signaling provided by toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands Pam3CSK (TLR1/TLR2), Imiquimod (TLR7), and GpG-ODN2006 (TLR9). All three TLR ligands stimulated B cells (CD19+) to produce cytokines IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-13, and IL-10, and chemokines MIP-1a, MIP-1b, MCP-1, IP-10, and IL-8. However, GM-CSF and G-CSF production was predominantly induced by TLR2 agonist. Most cytokines/chemokines/hematopoietic growth factors were predominantly or exclusively produced by memory B cells, and in general, TLR2 signal was more powerful than signal provided viaTLR7 and TLR9. No significant secretion of eotaxin, IFN-a, IFN-g, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-15, IL-17, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, and TNF-b (lymphotoxin) was observed. These data demonstrate that human B cells can be directly activated viaTLR1/TLR2, TLR7, and TLR9 to induce secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and hematopoietic growth factors and suggest a role of B cells in immune response against microbial pathogenesis and immune homeostasis.

20926645|t|Severe polyposis in Apc(1322T) mice is associated with submaximal Wnt signalling and increased expression of the stem cell marker Lgr5.
20926645|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a tumour suppressor gene mutated in the germline of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and somatically in most colorectal cancers. APC mutations impair b-catenin degradation, resulting in increased Wnt signalling. The most frequent APC mutation is a codon 1309 truncation that is associated with severe FAP. A previous study compared two mouse models of intestinal tumorigenesis, Apc(R850X) (Min) and Apc(1322T) (1322T), the latter a model of human codon 1309 changes. 1322T mice had more severe polyposis but, surprisingly, these tumours had lower levels of nuclear b-catenin than Min tumours. The consequences of these different b-catenin levels were investigated. METHODS: Enterocytes were isolated from 1322T and Min tumours by microdissection and gene expression profiling was performed. Differentially expressed Wnt targets and other stem cell markers were validated using quantitative PCR, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: As expected, lower nuclear b-catenin levels in 1322T lesions were associated with generally lower levels of Wnt target expression. However, expression of the Wnt target and stem cell marker Lgr5 was significantly higher in 1322T tumours than in Min tumours. Other stem cell markers (Musashi1, Bmi1 and the Wnt target Cd44) were also at higher levels in 1322T tumours. In addition, expression of the Bmp antagonist Gremlin1 was higher in 1322T tumours, together with lower Bmp2 and Bmp4 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The severe phenotype caused by truncation of Apc at codon 1322 is associated with an increased number of stem cells. Thus, a submaximal level of Wnt signalling favours the stem cell phenotype and this may promote tumorigenesis. A level of Wnt signalling exists that is too high for optimal tumour growth.

21172391|t|The kinesin superfamily protein KIF17 is regulated by the same transcription factor (NRF-1) as its cargo NR2B in neurons.
21172391|a|The kinesin superfamily of motor proteins is known to be ATP-dependent transporters of various types of cargoes. In neurons, KIF17 is found to transport vesicles containing the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit from the cell body specifically to the dendrites. These subunits are intimately associated with glutamatergic neurotransmission as well as with learning and memory. Glutamatergic synapses are highly energy-dependent, and recently we found that the same transcription factor, nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), co-regulates energy metabolism (via its regulation of cytochrome c oxidase and other mitochondrial enzymes) and neurochemicals of glutamatergic transmission (NR1, NR2B, GluR2, and nNOS). The present study tested our hypothesis that NRF-1 also transcriptionally regulates KIF17. By means of in silico analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays, in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, promoter mutations, and real-time quantitative PCR, we found that NRF-1 (but not NRF-2) functionally regulates Kif17, but not Kif1a, gene. NRF-1 binding sites on Kif17 gene are highly conserved among mice, rats, and humans. Silencing of NRF-1 with small interference RNA blocked the up-regulation of Kif17 mRNA and proteins (and of Grin1 and Grin2b) induced by KCl-mediated depolarization, whereas over-expressing NRF-1 rescued these transcripts and proteins from being suppressed by TTX. Thus, NRF-1 co-regulates oxidative enzymes that generate energy and neurochemicals that consume energy related to glutamatergic neurotransmission, such as KIF17, NR1, and NR2B, thereby ensuring that energy production matches energy utilization at the molecular and cellular levels.

21391871|t|Renal pro-apoptotic proteins are reduced by growth hormone resistance but not by visceral fat removal.
21391871|a|Growth hormone (GH) receptor knockout (GHRKO) mice are highly insulin sensitive and long-lived. Surgical visceral fat removal (VFR) improves insulin signaling in normal mice and rats and extends longevity in rats. We have previously demonstrated decreased expression of certain pro-apoptotic genes in kidneys of GHRKO mice and suggested that this could contribute to the increased longevity of these animals. The aim of the present study was to examine the level of the following proteins: caspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-8, bax, bad, phospho-bad, bcl-2, Smac/DIABLO, Apaf-1, phospho-p53 (pp53) and cytochrome c in male GHRKO and normal (N) mice subjected to VFR or sham surgery, at approximately six months of age. The kidneys were collected two months after VFR. Caspase-3, caspase-8, bax, bad, Smac/DIABLO, Apaf-1 and pp53 levels were decreased in GHRKO mice as compared to N animals. VFR did not change the level of any of the examined proteins. The decreased renal levels of pro-apoptotic proteins could contribute to the extended life-span caused by targeted disruption of the GH receptor gene but are apparently not involved in mediating the effects of VFR.

21431351|t|Deletion of growth hormone receptor gene but not visceral fat removal decreases expression of apoptosis-related genes in the kidney-potential mechanism of lifespan extension.
21431351|a|Mice homozygous for the targeted disruption of the growth hormone (GH) receptor (Ghr) gene (GH receptor knockout; GHRKO; KO) are hypoinsulinemic, highly insulin sensitive, normoglycemic, and long-lived. Visceral fat removal (VFR) is a surgical intervention which improves insulin signaling in normal (N) mice and rats and extends longevity in rats. We have previously demonstrated decreased expression level of certain pro-apoptotic genes in skeletal muscles and suggested that this may contribute to the regulation of longevity in GHRKO mice. Alterations in apoptosis-related genes expression in the kidneys also may potentially lead to lifespan extension. In this context, we decided to examine the renal expression of the following genes: caspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-8, bax, bad, bcl-2, Smac/DIABLO, Apaf-1, p53, and cytochrome c1 (cyc1) in male GHRKO and N mice subjected to VFR or sham surgery, at approximately 6 months of age. The kidneys were collected 2 months after VFR. As a result, caspase-3, caspase-9, and bax expressions were decreased in KO mice as compared to N animals. Expressions of Smac/DIABLO, caspase-8, bcl-2, bad, and p53 did not differ between KOs and N mice. VFR did not change the expression of the examined genes in KO or N mice. In conclusion, endocrine abnormalities in GHRKO mice result in decreased expression of pro-apoptotic genes and VFR did not alter the examined genes expression in N and KO mice. These data are consistent with a model in which alterations of GH signaling and/or insulin sensitivity lead to increased lifespan mediated by decreased renal expression of pro-apoptotic genes.

21479249|t|IL-1a mediated chorioamnionitis induces depletion of FoxP3+ cells and ileal inflammation in the ovine fetal gut.
21479249|a|BACKGROUND: Endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis increases IL-1 and provokes an inflammatory response in the fetal ileum that interferes with intestinal maturation. In the present study, we tested in an ovine chorioamnionitis model whether IL-1 is a major cytokine driving the inflammatory response in the fetal ileum. METHOD: Sheep bearing singleton fetuses received a single intraamniotic injection of recombinant ovine IL-1a at 7, 3 or 1 d before caesarian delivery at 125 days gestational age (term = 150 days). RESULTS: 3 and 7 d after IL-1a administration, intestinal mRNA levels for IL-4, IL-10, IFN-g and TNF-a were strongly elevated. Numbers of CD3+ and CD4+ T-lymphocytes and myeloidperoxidase+ cells were increased whereas FoxP3+ T-cells were detected at low frequency. This increased proinflammatory state was associated with ileal mucosal barrier loss as demonstrated by decreased levels of the intestinal fatty acid binding protein and disruption of the tight junctional protein ZO-1. CONCLUSION: Intraamniotic IL-1a causes an acute detrimental inflammatory response in the ileum, suggesting that induction of IL-1 is a critical element in the pathophysiological effects of endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis. A disturbed balance between T-effector and FoxP3+ cells may contribute to this process.

21607759|t|Aberrant expression of costimulatory molecules in splenocytes of the mevalonate kinase-deficient mouse model of human hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS).
21607759|a|OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the activation status and proliferative capacities of splenic lymphocyte populations from a mevalonate kinase-deficient mouse model of hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS). We previously reported that murine mevalonate kinase gene ablation was embryonic lethal for homozygous mutants while heterozygotes (Mvk (+/-)) demonstrated several phenotypic features of human HIDS including increased serum levels of IgD, IgA, and TNFa, temperature dysregulation, hematological abnormalities, and splenomegaly. METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface activation markers on T and B lymphocytes, and macrophage populations, demonstrated aberrant expression of B7 glycoproteins in all splenic cell types studied. Differences in expression levels between Mvk (+/-) and Mvk (+/+) littermate controls were observed in both the basal state (unstimulated) and after Concanavalin A (Con-A) stimulation in vitro of whole splenocyte cultures. In Mvk (+/-) CD4 and CD8 T cells, alterations in expression of CD25, CD80, CD152, and CD28 were observed. Mvk (+/-) splenic macrophages expressed altered levels of CD80, CD86, CD40, and CD11c while Mvk (+/-) B lymphocytes had differential expression of CD40, CD80, and CD86. Mvk (+/-) splenocyte subpopulations also exhibited altered proliferative capacities in response to in vitro stimulation. CONCLUSION: We postulate that imbalances in the expression of cell surface proteins necessary for activation, proliferation, and regulation of the intensity and duration of an immune response may result in defective T cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions in our model and potentially in human HIDS.

21637860|t|Oxidized LDL receptor 1 (OLR1) as a possible link between obesity, dyslipidemia and cancer.
21637860|a|Recent studies have linked expression of lectin-like ox-LDL receptor 1 (OLR1) to tumorigenesis. We analyzed microarray data from Olr1 knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice for genes involved in cellular transformation and evaluated effects of OLR1 over-expression in normal mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) and breast cancer cells (HCC1143) in terms of gene expression, migration, adhesion and transendothelial migration. Twenty-six out of 238 genes were inhibited in tissues of OLR1 KO mice; the vast majority of OLR1 sensitive genes contained NF-kB binding sites in their promoters. Further studies revealed broad inhibition of NF-kB target genes outside of the transformation-associated gene pool, with enrichment themes of defense response, immune response, apoptosis, proliferation, and wound healing. Transcriptome of Olr1 KO mice also revealed inhibition of de novo lipogenesis, rate-limiting enzymes fatty acid synthase (Fasn), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Scd1) and ELOVL family member 6 (Elovl6), as well as lipolytic phospholipase A2 group IVB (Pla2g4b). In studies comparing MCF10A and HCC1143, the latter displayed 60% higher OLR1 expression. Forced over-expression of OLR1 resulted in upregulation of NF-kB (p65) and its target pro-oncogenes involved in inhibition of apoptosis (BCL2, BCL2A1, TNFAIP3) and regulation of cell cycle (CCND2) in both cell lines. Basal expression of FASN, SCD1 and PLA2G4B, as well as lipogenesis transcription factors PPARA, SREBF2 and CREM, was higher in HCC1143 cells. Over-expression of OLR1 in HCC1143 cells also enhanced cell migration, without affecting their adherence to TNFa-activated endothelium or transendothelial migration. On the other hand, OLR1 neutralizing antibody inhibited both adhesion and transmigration of untreated HCC1143 cells. We conclude that OLR1 may act as an oncogene by activation of NF-kB target genes responsible for proliferation, migration and inhibition of apoptosis and de novo lipogenesis genes.

21789165|t|A small peptide modeled after the NRAGE repeat domain inhibits XIAP-TAB1-TAK1 signaling for NF-kB activation and apoptosis in P19 cells.
21789165|a|In normal growth and development, apoptosis is necessary to shape the central nervous system and to eliminate excess neurons which are not required for innervation. In some diseases, however, apoptosis can be either overactive as in some neurodegenerative disorders or severely attenuated as in the spread of certain cancers. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) transmit signals for regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Responding to BMP receptors stimulated from BMP ligands, neurotrophin receptor-mediated MAGE homolog (NRAGE) binds and functions with the XIAP-TAK1-TAB1 complex to activate p38(MAPK) and induces apoptosis in cortical neural progenitors. NRAGE contains a unique repeat domain that is only found in human, mouse, and rat homologs that we theorize is pivotal in its BMP MAPK role. Previously, we showed that deletion of the repeat domain inhibits apoptosis, p38(MAPK) phosphorylation, and caspase-3 cleavage in P19 neural progenitor cells. We also showed that the XIAP-TAB1-TAK1 complex is dependent on NRAGE for IKK-a/b phosphorylation and NF-kB activation. XIAP is a major inhibitor of caspases, the main executioners of apoptosis. Although it has been shown previously that NRAGE binds to the RING domain of XIAP, it has not been determined which NRAGE domain binds to XIAP. Here, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to determine that there is a strong likelihood of a direct interaction between NRAGE and XIAP occurring at NRAGE's unique repeat domain which we also attribute to be the domain responsible for downstream signaling of NF-kB and activating IKK subunits. From these results, we designed a small peptide modeled after the NRAGE repeat domain which we have determined inhibits NF-kB activation and apoptosis in P19 cells. These intriguing results illustrate that the paradigm of the NRAGE repeat domain may hold promising therapeutic strategies in developing pharmaceutical solutions for combating harmful diseases involving excessive downstream BMP signaling, including apoptosis.

21810259|t|HIV-1 Tat activates indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in murine organotypic hippocampal slice cultures in a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent manner.
21810259|a|BACKGROUND: We have established that activation of the tryptophan degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) mediates the switch from cytokine-induced sickness behavior to depressive-like behavior. Because human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein causes depressive-like behavior in mice, we investigated its ability to activate IDO in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) derived from neonatal C57BL/6 mice. METHODS: Depressive-like behavior in C57BL/6J mice was assessed by the forced swim test. Expression of cytokines and IDO mRNA in OHSCs was measured by real-time RT-PCR and cytokine protein was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). p38 MAPK phosphorylation was analyzed by western blot. RESULTS: Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of Tat (40 ng) induced depressive-like behavior in the absence of sickness. Addition of Tat (40 ng/slice) to the medium of OHSCs induced IDO steady-state mRNA that peaked at 6 h. This effect was potentiated by pretreatment with IFNg. Tat also induced the synthesis and release of TNFa and IL-6 protein in the supernatant of the slices and increased expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the serotonin transporter (SERT). Tat had no effect on endogenous synthesis of IFNg. To explore the mechanisms of Tat-induced IDO expression, slices were pretreated with the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB 202190 for 30 min before Tat treatment. SB 202190 significantly decreased IDO expression induced by Tat, and this effect was accompanied by a reduction of Tat-induced expression of TNFa, IL-6, iNOS and SERT. CONCLUSION: These data establish that Tat induces IDO expression via an IFNg-independent mechanism that depends upon activation of p38 MAPK. Targeting IDO itself or the p38 MAPK signaling pathway could provide a novel therapy for comorbid depressive disorders in HIV-1-infected patients.

21928348|t|Nemo-like kinase inhibits osteoblastogenesis by suppressing bone morphogenetic protein and WNT canonical signaling.
21928348|a|The bone morphogenetic protein/Signaling mothers against decapentaplegic (BMP/Smad) and the WNT signaling pathways regulate the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the osteoblastic lineage. Nemo-like kinase (Nlk) is an evolutionary conserved kinase that suppresses Smad transactivation and WNT canonical signaling. However, it is not clear whether these effects of Nlk have any consequence on the differentiation of mammalian cells. To study the function of Nlk during the commitment of ST-2 bone marrow stromal cells to the osteoblastic fate, Nlk was downregulated by RNA interference (RNAi), following transfection of a specific small interfering (si)RNA. Nlk downregulation increased alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin expression and sensitized ST-2 cells to the effects of BMP2 and WNT3 on alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression and activity. Accordingly, Nlk downregulation enhanced the effect of BMP2 on the transactivation of the BMP/Smad reporter construct 12xSBE-Oc-pGL3, and on the levels of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8, whereas it did not affect the transactivation of the transforming growth factor-b/Smad reporter pSBE-Luc. Nlk downregulation sensitized ST-2 cells to the effects of WNT3 on the transactivation of the WNT/T-cell factor (Tcf) reporter construct 16xTCF-Luc, whereas it did not affect cytosolic b-catenin levels. To understand the function of Nlk in cells committed to the osteoblastic lineage, Nlk was suppressed by RNAi in primary calvarial osteoblasts. Downregulation of Nlk increased alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin transcripts and sensitized osteoblasts to the effects of BMP2 on alkaline phosphatase activity and Smad1/5/8 transactivation and phosphorylation. In conclusion, Nlk suppresses osteoblastogenesis by opposing BMP/Smad and WNT canonical signaling.

21949024|t|Blockade of Notch ligand d1 promotes allograft survival by inhibiting alloreactive Th1 cells and cytotoxic T cell generation.
21949024|a|The Notch signaling pathway has been recently shown to contribute to T cell differentiation in vitro. However, the in vivo function of Notch signaling in transplantation remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the importance of Delta1 in regulating the alloimmune response in vivo. Delta1 expression was upregulated on dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages upon transplantation in a BALB/c into B6 vascularized cardiac transplant model. Whereas administration of anti-Delta1 mAb only slightly delayed survival of cardiac allografts in this fully MHC-mismatched model, it significantly prolonged graft survival in combination with single-dose CTLA4-Ig or in CD28 knockout recipients. The prolongation of allograft survival was associated with Th2 polarization and a decrease in Th1 and granzyme B-producing cytotoxic T cells. The survival benefit of Delta1 blockade was abrogated after IL-4 neutralization and in STAT6KO recipients, but was maintained in STAT4KO recipients, reinforcing the key role of Th2 cell development in its graft-prolonging effects. To our knowledge, these data demonstrate for the first time an important role of Delta1 in alloimmunity, identifying Delta1 ligand as a potential novel target for immunomodulation in transplantation.

21951951|a|A 54-year-old woman was diagnosed with infiltrative ductal breast carcinoma.

Ten months after transplantation, she relapsed with an AML with basophilic maturation characterized by CD45(low) CD33(high), CD117+, CD13(-/+), HLA Dr(high), CD123(high), and CD203c+ blast cells lacking expression of CD7, CD10, CD34, CD15, CD14, CD56, CD36, CD64, and cytoplasmic tryptase. Karyotype analysis showed the emergence of a new clone with t(2;14) and FISH analysis indicated the presence of MLL gene rearrangement consistent with del(11q23). Interestingly, AML blast cell DNA tested with microsatellite markers showed the same pattern as the donor's, suggesting that this AML emerged from donor cells. Additionally, polymorphisms of the XPA, XPD, XRCC1, XRCC3 and RAD51 DNA repair genes revealed three unfavorable alleles with low DNA repair capacity.In summary, we report the first case of AML involving XPD and XRCC3 polymorphisms from donor origin following allogeneic stem cell transplantation and highlight the potential need for careful analysis of DNA repair gene polymorphisms in selecting candidate donors prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

22022612|t|Expression of novel opsins and intrinsic light responses in the mammalian retinal ganglion cell line RGC-5. Presence of OPN5 in the rat retina.
22022612|a|The vertebrate retina is known to contain three classes of photoreceptor cells: cones and rods responsible for vision, and intrinsically photoresponsive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) involved in diverse non-visual functions such as photic entrainment of daily rhythms and pupillary light responses. In this paper we investigated the potential intrinsic photoresponsiveness of the rat RGC line, RGC-5, by testing for the presence of visual and non-visual opsins and assessing expression of the immediate-early gene protein c-Fos and changes in intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in response to brief light pulses. Cultured RGC-5 cells express a number of photopigment mRNAs such as retinal G protein coupled receptor (RGR), encephalopsin/panopsin (Opn3), neuropsin (Opn5) and cone opsin (Opn1mw) but not melanopsin (Opn4) or rhodopsin. Opn5 immunoreactivity was observed in RGC-5 cells and in the inner retina of rat, mainly localized in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Furthermore, white light pulses of different intensities and durations elicited changes both in intracellular Ca(2+) levels and in the induction of c-Fos protein in RGC-5 cell cultures. The results demonstrate that RGC-5 cells expressing diverse putative functional photopigments display intrinsic photosensitivity which accounts for the photic induction of c-Fos protein and changes in intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization. The presence of Opn5 in the GCL of the rat retina suggests the existence of a novel type of photoreceptor cell.

22027689|t|MUC13 mucin augments pancreatic tumorigenesis.
22027689|a|The high death rate of pancreatic cancer is attributed to the lack of reliable methods for early detection and underlying molecular mechanisms of its aggressive pathogenesis. Although MUC13, a newly identified transmembrane mucin, is known to be aberrantly expressed in ovarian and gastro-intestinal cancers, its role in pancreatic cancer is unknown. Herein, we investigated the expression profile and functions of MUC13 in pancreatic cancer progression. The expression profile of MUC13 in pancreatic cancer was investigated using a recently generated monoclonal antibody (clone PPZ0020) and pancreatic tissue microarrays. The expression of MUC13 was significantly (P < 0.005) higher in cancer samples compared with normal/nonneoplastic pancreatic tissues. For functional analyses, full-length MUC13 was expressed in MUC13 null pancreatic cancer cell lines, MiaPaca and Panc1. MUC13 overexpression caused a significant (P < 0.05) increase in cell motility, invasion, proliferation, and anchorage-dependent or -independent clonogenicity while decreasing cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion. Exogenous MUC13 expression significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced pancreatic tumor growth and reduced animal survival in a xenograft mouse model. These tumorigenic characteristics correlated with the upregulation/phosphorylation of HER2, p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Akt, and metastasin (S100A4), and the suppression of p53. Conversely, suppression of MUC13 in HPAFII pancreatic cancer cells by short hairpin RNA resulted in suppression of tumorigenic characteristics, repression of HER2, PAK1, ERK, and S100A4, and upregulation of p53. MUC13 suppression also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced tumor growth and increased animal survival. These results imply a role of MUC13 in pancreatic cancer and suggest its potential use as a diagnostic and therapeutic target.

22144572|t|Loss of myeloid related protein-8/14 exacerbates cardiac allograft rejection.
22144572|a|BACKGROUND: The calcium-binding proteins myeloid-related protein (MRP)-8 (S100A8) and MRP-14 (S100A9) form MRP-8/14 heterodimers (S100A8/A9, calprotectin) that regulate myeloid cell function and inflammatory responses and serve as early serum markers for monitoring acute allograft rejection. Despite functioning as a proinflammatory mediator, the pathophysiological role of MRP-8/14 complexes in cardiovascular disease is incompletely defined. This study investigated the role of MRP-8/14 in cardiac allograft rejection using MRP-14(-/-) mice that lack MRP-8/14 complexes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined parenchymal rejection after major histocompatibility complex class II allomismatched cardiac transplantation (bm12 donor heart and B6 recipients) in wild-type (WT) and MRP-14(-/-) recipients. Allograft survival averaged 5.9+2.9 weeks (n=10) in MRP-14(-/-) recipients compared with >12 weeks (n=15; P<0.0001) in WT recipients. Two weeks after transplantation, allografts in MRP-14(-/-) recipients had significantly higher parenchymal rejection scores (2.8+0.8; n=8) than did WT recipients (0.8+0.8; n=12; P<0.0001). Compared with WT recipients, allografts in MRP-14(-/-) recipients had significantly increased T-cell and macrophage infiltration and increased mRNA levels of interferon-g and interferon-g-associated chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), interleukin-6, and interleukin-17 with significantly higher levels of Th17 cells. MRP-14(-/-) recipients also had significantly more lymphocytes in the adjacent para-aortic lymph nodes than did WT recipients (cells per lymph node: 23.7+0.7x10(5) for MRP-14(-/-) versus 6.0+0.2x10(5) for WT; P<0.0001). The dendritic cells (DCs) of the MRP-14(-/-) recipients of bm12 hearts expressed significantly higher levels of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 than did those of WT recipients 2 weeks after transplantation. Mixed leukocyte reactions with allo-endothelial cell-primed MRP-14(-/-) DCs resulted in significantly higher antigen-presenting function than reactions using WT DCs. Ovalbumin-primed MRP-14(-/-) DCs augmented proliferation of OT-II (ovalbumin-specific T cell receptor transgenic) CD4(+) T cells with increased interleukin-2 and interferon-g production. Cardiac allografts of B6 major histocompatibility complex class II(-/-) hosts and of B6 WT hosts receiving MRP-14(-/-) DCs had significantly augmented inflammatory cell infiltration and accelerated allograft rejection compared with WT DCs from transferred recipient allografts. Bone marrow-derived MRP-14(-/-) DCs infected with MRP-8 and MRP-14 retroviral vectors showed significantly decreased CD80 and CD86 expression compared with controls, indicating that MRP-8/14 regulates B7-costimulatory molecule expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that MRP-14 regulates B7 molecule expression and reduces antigen presentation by DCs and subsequent T-cell priming. The absence of MRP-14 markedly increased T-cell activation and exacerbated allograft rejection, indicating a previously unrecognized role for MRP-14 in immune cell biology.

22303482|t|TBX21 and HLX1 polymorphisms influence cytokine secretion at birth.
22303482|a|BACKGROUND: TBX21 (T cell specific T-box transcription factor) and HLX1 (H.20-like homeobox 1) are crucial transcription factors of T(H)1-cells, inducing their differentiation and suppressing T(H)2 commitment, particularly important for early life immune development. This study investigated the influence of TBX21 and HLX1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which have previously been shown to be associated with asthma, on T(H)1/T(H)2 lineage cytokines at birth. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) of 200 neonates were genotyped for two TBX21 and three HLX1 SNPs. CBMCs were stimulated with innate (Lipid A, LpA; Peptidoglycan, Ppg), adaptive stimuli (house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 1, Derp1) or mitogen (phytohemagglutinin, PHA). Cytokines, T-cells and mRNA expression of T(H)1/T(H)2-related genes were assessed. Atopic diseases during the first 3 years of life were assessed by questionnaire answered by the parents. Carriers of TBX21 promoter SNP rs17250932 and HLX1 promoter SNP rs2738751 showed reduced or trendwise reduced (p<0.07) IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-a secretion after LpA-stimulation. Carriers of HLX1 SNP rs2738751 had lower IL-13 levels following Ppg-stimulation (p = 0.08). Carriers of HLX1 exon 1 SNP rs12141189 showed increased IL-5 (LpA, p = 0.007; Ppg, p = 0.10), trendwise increased IL-13 (LpA), higher GM-CSF (LpA/Ppg, p<0.05) and trendwise decreased IFN-g secretion (Derp1+LpA-stimulation, p = 0.1). Homozygous carriers of HLX1 promoter SNP rs3806325 showed increased IL-13 and IL-6 (unstimulated, p<0.03). In carriers of TBX21 intron 3 SNP rs11079788 no differences in cytokine secretion were observed. mRNA expression of T(H)1/T(H)2-related genes partly correlated with cytokines at protein level. TBX21 SNP rs11079788 carriers developed less symptoms of atopic dermatitis at 3 years of age (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in TBX21 and HLX1 influenced primarily IL-5 and IL-13 secretion after LpA-stimulation in cord blood suggesting that genetic variations in the transcription factors essential for the T(H)1-pathway may contribute to modified T(H)2-immune responses already early in life. Further follow-up of the cohort is required to study the polymorphisms' relevance for immune-mediated diseases such as childhood asthma.

22622800|t|IL-10 deficiency blocks the ability of LPS to regulate expression of tolerance-related molecules on dendritic cells.
22622800|a|Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in regulating the local inflammatory immune response, but regulatory mechanisms of this cytokine have not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that IL-10 deficiency renders LPS treatment ineffective in regulating the expression of CD40, CD80, CD86, B7-H2, and B7-DC on dendritic cells (DCs) and blocks upregulation of IL-27. This inability to respond to LPS was found in both IL-10(-/-) bone marrow derived and splenic DCs. Compared with wild-type DCs, IL-10(-/-) DCs expressed similar levels of TLR4 and CD14, but produced less LPS-binding protein. The deficiency in LPS-binding protein production may explain the failure of IL-10(-/-) DCs to respond normally to LPS. Moreover, lack of IL-10 modulated the proportions of CD11c(+) CD8(+) and CD11c(+) B220(+) DCs, which play an important role in local inflammatory responses and tolerance. IL-10 deficiency also blocked expression of galectin-1, CD205, and CD103, which are necessary for central and peripheral tolerance. While they did not respond to LPS, IL-10(-/-) DCs produced increased levels of IL-6 and CCL4 after TNF-a treatment. Together, our results demonstrate that IL-10 deficiency affects the immune functions of DCs, which may contribute to the increased severity of autoimmune diseases seen in IL-10(-/-) mice.

22971992|t|EGCG inhibits growth of human pancreatic tumors orthotopically implanted in Balb C nude mice through modulation of FKHRL1/FOXO3a and neuropilin.
22971992|a|Human pancreatic cancer is currently one of the fourth leading causes of cancer-related mortality with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5 %. Since pancreatic carcinoma is largely refractory to conventional therapies, there is a strong medical need for the development of novel and innovative cancer preventive strategies. The forkhead transcription factors of the O class (FOXO) play a major role in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumorigenesis. The objectives of this study were to examine whether FKHRL1/FOXO3a modulates antitumor activity of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an active ingredient in green tea, in pancreatic cancer model in vivo. PANC-1 cells were orthotopically implanted into Balb c nude mice and gavaged with EGCG after tumor formation. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by Ki67 and TUNEL staining, respectively. The expression of PI3K, AKT, ERK, and FOXO3a/FKHRL1 and its target genes were measured by the western blot analysis and/or q-RT-PCR. FOXO-DNA binding was measured by gel shift assay. EGCG-treated mice showed significant inhibition in tumor growth which was associated with reduced phosphorylation of ERK, PI3K, AKT, and FKHRL1/FOXO3a, and modulation of FOXO target genes. EGCG induced apoptosis by upregulating Bim and activating caspase-3. EGCG modulated markers of cell cycle (p27/KIP1), angiogenesis (CD31, VEGF, IL-6, IL-8, SEMA3F, and HIF1a), and metastasis (MMP2 and MMP7). The inhibition of VEGF by EGCG was associated with suppression of neuropilin. EGCG inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition by upregulating the expression of E-cadherin and inhibiting the expression of N-cadherin and Zeb1. These data suggest that EGCG inhibits pancreatic cancer orthotopic tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis which are associated with inhibition of PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways and activation of FKHRL1/FOXO3a. As a conclusion, EGCG can be used for the prevention and/or treatment of pancreatic cancer.

23022312|t|N-Myc and L-Myc are essential for hair cell formation but not maintenance.
23022312|a|Sensorineural hearing loss results from damage to the hair cells of the organ of Corti and is irreversible in mammals. While hair cell regeneration may prove to be the ideal therapy after hearing loss, prevention of initial hair cell loss could provide even more benefit at a lower cost. Previous studies have shown that the deletion of Atoh1 results in embryonic loss of hair cells while the absence of Barhl1, Gfi1, and Pou4f3 leads to the progressive loss of hair cells in newborn mice. We recently reported that in the early embryonic absence of N-Myc (using Pax2-Cre), hair cells in the organ of Corti develop and remain until at least seven days after birth, with subsequent progressive loss. Thus, N-Myc plays a role in hair cell viability; however, it is unclear if this is due to its early expression in hair cell precursors and throughout the growing otocyst as it functions through proliferation or its late expression exclusively in differentiated hair cells. Furthermore, the related family member L-Myc is mostly co-expressed in the ear, including in differentiated hair cells, but its function has not been studied and could be partially redundant to N-Myc. To test for a long-term function of the Mycs in differentiated hair cells, we generated nine unique genotypes knocking out N-Myc and/or L-Myc after initial formation of hair cells using the well-characterized Atoh1-Cre. We tested functionality of the auditory and vestibular systems at both P21 and four months of age and under the administration of the ototoxic drug cisplatin. We conclude that neither N-Myc nor L-Myc is likely to play important roles in long-term hair cell maintenance. Therefore, it is likely that the late-onset loss of hair cells resulting from early deletion of the Mycs leads to an unsustainable developmental defect.

23028939|t|Sphingosine kinase 1 is required for mesothelioma cell proliferation: role of histone acetylation.
23028939|a|BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a devastating disease with an overall poor prognosis. Despite the recent advances in targeted molecular therapies, there is a clear and urgent need for the identification of novel mesothelioma targets for the development of highly efficacious therapeutics. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we report that the expression of Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SphK1) protein was preferentially elevated in MPM tumor tissues (49 epithelioid and 13 sarcomatoid) compared to normal tissue (n = 13). In addition, we also observed significantly elevated levels of SphK1 and SphK2 mRNA and SphK1 protein expression in MPM cell lines such as H2691, H513 and H2461 compared to the non-malignant mesothelial Met5 cells. The underlying mechanism appears to be mediated by SphK1 induced upregulation of select gene transcription programs such as that of CBP/p300 and PCAF, two histone acetyl transferases (HAT), and the down regulation of cell cycle dependent kinase inhibitor genes such as p27Kip1 and p21Cip1. In addition, using immunoprecipitates of anti-acetylated histone antibody from SphK inhibitor, SphK-I2 treated Met5A and H2691 cell lysates, we also showed activation of other cell proliferation related genes, such as Top2A (DNA replication), AKB (chromosome remodeling and mitotic spindle formation), and suppression of p21 CIP1 and p27KIP1. The CDK2, HAT1 and MYST2 were, however, unaffected in the above study. Using SphK inhibitor and specific siRNA targeting either SphK1 or SphK2, we also unequivocally established that SphK1, but not SphK2, promotes H2691 mesothelioma cell proliferation. Using a multi-walled carbon nanotubes induced peritoneal mesothelioma mouse model, we showed that the SphK1-/- null mice exhibited significantly less inflammation and granulamatous nodules compared to their wild type counterparts. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The lipid kinase SphK1 plays a positive and essential role in the growth and development of malignant mesothelioma and is therefore a likely therapeutic target.

23056516|t|Adipose tissue promotes a serum cytokine profile related to lower insulin sensitivity after chronic central leptin infusion.
23056516|a|Obesity is an inflammatory state characterized by an augment in circulating inflammatory factors. Leptin may modulate the synthesis of these factors by white adipose tissue decreasing insulin sensitivity. We have examined the effect of chronic central administration of leptin on circulating levels of cytokines and the possible relationship with cytokine expression and protein content as well as with leptin and insulin signaling in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues. In addition, we analyzed the possible correlation between circulating levels of cytokines and peripheral insulin resistance. We studied 18 male Wistar rats divided into controls (C), those treated icv for 14 days with a daily dose of 12 ug of leptin (L) and a pair-fed group (PF) that received the same food amount consumed by the leptin group. Serum leptin and insulin were measured by ELISA, mRNA levels of interferon-g (IFN-g), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) by real time PCR and serum and adipose tissue levels of these cytokines by multiplexed bead immunoassay. Serum leptin, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-g and HOMA-IR were increased in L and TNF-a was decreased in PF and L. Serum leptin and IL-2 levels correlate positively with HOMA-IR index and negatively with serum glucose levels during an ip insulin tolerance test. In L, an increase in mRNA levels of IL-2 was found in both adipose depots and IFN-g only in visceral tissue. Activation of leptin signaling was increased and insulin signaling decreased in subcutaneous fat of L. In conclusion, leptin mediates the production of inflammatory cytokines by adipose tissue independent of its effects on food intake, decreasing insulin sensitivity.

23069675|t|Critical role of neuronal pentraxin 1 in mitochondria-mediated hypoxic-ischemic neuronal injury.
23069675|a|Developing brain is highly susceptible to hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury leading to severe neurological disabilities in surviving infants and children. Previously, we have reported induction of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), a novel neuronal protein of long-pentraxin family, following HI neuronal injury. Here, we investigated how this specific signal is propagated to cause the HI neuronal death. We used wild-type (WT) and NP1 knockout (NP1-KO) mouse hippocampal cultures, modeled in vitro following exposure to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), and in vivo neonatal (P9-10) mouse model of HI brain injury. Our results show induction of NP1 in primary hippocampal neurons following OGD exposure (4-8 h) and in the ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions at 24-48 h post-HI compared to the contralateral side. We also found increased PTEN activity concurrent with OGD time-dependent (4-8 h) dephosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and GSK-3b (Ser9). OGD also caused a time-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of Bad (Ser136), and Bax protein levels. Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation analyses revealed increased mitochondrial translocation of Bad and Bax proteins from cytoplasm following OGD (4 h) and simultaneously increased release of Cyt C from mitochondria followed by activation of caspase-3. NP1 protein was immunoprecipitated with Bad and Bax proteins; OGD caused increased interactions of NP1 with Bad and Bax, thereby, facilitating their mitochondrial translocation and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (D (m)). This NP1 induction preceded the increased mitochondrial release of cytochrome C (Cyt C) into the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and OGD time-dependent cell death in WT primary hippocampal neurons. In contrast, in NP1-KO neurons there was no translocation of Bad and Bax from cytosol to the mitochondria, and no evidence of D (m) loss, increased Cyt C release and caspase-3 activation following OGD; which resulted in significantly reduced neuronal death. Our results indicate a regulatory role of NP1 in Bad/Bax-dependent mitochondrial release of Cyt C and caspase-3 activation. Together our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which NP1 regulates mitochondria-driven hippocampal cell death; suggesting NP1 as a potential therapeutic target against HI brain injury in neonates.

23110133|t|Characterization and identification of subpopulations of mononuclear preosteoclasts induced by TNF-a in combination with TGF-b in rats.
23110133|a|Osteoclasts are unique multinucleated cells formed by fusion of preosteoclasts derived from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, which are induced by RANKL. However, characteristics and subpopulations of osteoclast precursor cells are poorly understood. We show here that a combination of TNF-a, TGF-b, and M-CSF efficiently generates mononuclear preosteoclasts but not multinucleated osteoclasts (MNCs) in rat bone marrow cultures depleted of stromal cells. Using a rat osteoclast-specific mAb, Kat1, we found that TNF-a and TGF-b specifically increased Kat1(+)c-fms(+) and Kat1(+)c-fms(-) cells but not Kat1(-)c-fms(+) cells. Kat1(-)c-fms(+) cells appeared in early stages of culture, but Kat1(+)c-fms(+) and Kat1(+)c-fms(-) cells increased later. Preosteoclasts induced by TNF-a, TGF-b, and M-CSF rapidly differentiated into osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL and hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, suggesting that preosteoclasts are terminally differentiated cells. We further analyzed the expression levels of genes encoding surface proteins in bone marrow macrophages (BMM), preosteoclasts, and MNCs. Preosteoclasts expressed itgam (CD11b) and chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR2; however, in preosteoclasts the expression of chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR2 was not up-regulated compared to their expression in BMM. However, addition of RANKL to preosteoclasts markedly increased the expression of CCR1. In contrast, expression of macrophage antigen emr-1 (F4/80) and chemokine receptor CCR5 was down-regulated in preosteoclasts. The combination of TNF-a, TGF-b, and M-CSF induced Kat1(+)CD11b(+) cells, but these cells were also induced by TNF-a alone. In addition, MIP-1a and MCP-1, which are ligands for CCR1 and CCR2, were chemotactic for preosteoclasts, and promoted multinucleation of preosteoclasts. Finally, we found that Kat1(+)c-fms(+) cells were present in bone tissues of rats with adjuvant arthritis. These data demonstrate that TNF-a in combination with TGF-b efficiently generates preosteoclasts in vitro. We delineated characteristics that are useful for identifying and isolating rat preosteoclasts, and found that CCR1 expression was regulated in the fusion step in osteoclastogenesis.

23220172|t|Overexpression of human selenoprotein H in neuronal cells enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and function through activation of protein kinase A, protein kinase B, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein pathway.
23220172|a|Mitochondrial biogenesis is activated by nuclear encoded transcription co-activator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g coactivator-1a (PGC-1a), which is regulated by several upstream factors including protein kinase A and Akt/protein kinase B. We have previously shown that selenoprotein H enhances the levels of nuclear regulators for mitochondrial biogenesis, increases mitochondrial mass and improves mitochondrial respiratory rate, under physiological condition. Furthermore, overexpression of selenoprotein H protects neuronal HT22 cells from ultraviolet B irradiation-induced cell damage by lowering reactive oxygen species production, and inhibiting activation of caspase-3 and -9, as well as p53. The objective of this study is to identify the cell signaling pathways by which selenoprotein H initiates mitochondrial biogenesis. We first confirmed our previous observation that selenoprotein H transfected HT22 cells increased the protein levels of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial biogenesis factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g coactivator-1a, nuclear respiratory factor 1 and mitochondrial transcription factor A. We then observed that total and phosphorylation of protein kinase A, Akt/protein kinase B and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) were significantly increased in selenoprotein H transfected cells compared to vector transfected HT22 cells. To verify whether the observed stimulating effects on mitochondrial biogenesis pathways are caused by selenoprotein H and mediated through CREB, we knocked down selenoprotein H mRNA level using siRNA and inhibited CREB with napthol AS-E phosphate in selenoprotein H transfected cells and repeated the measurements of the aforementioned biomarkers. Our results revealed that silencing of selenoprotein H not only decreased the protein levels of PGC-1a, nuclear respiratory factor 1 and mitochondrial transcription factor A, but also decreased the total and phosphorylation levels of protein kinase A, protein kinase B, and CREB. Similarly, CREB inhibition reduced CREB activation and PGC-1a protein levels in selenoprotein H transfected cells. Moreover, selenoprotein H transfection increased the activity of mitochondrial complexes and prevented the ultraviolet B induced fall of mitochondrial membrane potential. We conclude that the effects of selenoprotein H on mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function are probably mediated through protein kinase A-CREB-PGC-1a and Akt/protein kinase B-CREB-PGC-1a pathways.

23241883|t|Prohibitins and the cytoplasmic domain of CD86 cooperate to mediate CD86 signaling in B lymphocytes.
23241883|a|CD86 engagement on a CD40L/IL-4-primed murine B cell activates signaling intermediates that promote NF-kB activation to increase Oct-2 and mature IgG1 mRNA and protein expression, as well as the rate of IgG1 transcription, without affecting class switch recombination. One of the most proximal signaling intermediates identified is phospholipase Cg2, a protein reported to bind tyrosine residues, which are absent in the cytoplasmic domain of CD86. Using a proteomics-based identification approach, we show that the tyrosine-containing transmembrane adaptor proteins prohibitin (Phb)1 and Phb2 bind to CD86. The basal expression of Phb1/2 and association with CD86 was low in resting B cells, whereas the level of expression and association increased primarily after priming with CD40. The CD86-induced increase in Oct-2 and IgG1 was less when either Phb1/2 expression was reduced by short hairpin RNA or the cytoplasmic domain of CD86 was truncated or mutated at serine/threonine protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, which did not affect Phb1/2 binding to CD86. Using this approach, we also show that Phb1/2 and the CD86 cytoplasmic domain are required for the CD86-induced phosphorylation of IkBa, which we previously reported leads to NF-kB p50/p65 activation, whereas only Phb1/2 was required for the CD86-induced phosphorylation of phospholipase Cg2 and protein kinase Ca/b(II), which we have previously reported leads to NF-kB (p65) phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation. Taken together, these findings suggest that Phb1/2 and the CD86 cytoplasmic domain cooperate to mediate CD86 signaling in a B cell through differential phosphorylation of distal signaling intermediates required to increase IgG1.

23460868|t|b-catenin is essential for efficient in vitro premyogenic mesoderm formation but can be partially compensated by retinoic acid signalling.
23460868|a|Previous studies have shown that P19 cells expressing a dominant negative b-catenin mutant (b-cat/EnR) cannot undergo myogenic differentiation in the presence or absence of muscle-inducing levels of retinoic acid (RA). While RA could upregulate premyogenic mesoderm expression, including Pax3/7 and Meox1, only Pax3/7 and Gli2 could be upregulated by RA in the presence of b-cat/EnR. However, the use of a dominant negative construct that cannot be compensated by other factors is limiting due to the possibility of negative chromatin remodelling overriding compensatory mechanisms. In this study, we set out to determine if b-catenin function is essential for myogenesis with and without RA, by creating P19 cells with reduced b-catenin transcriptional activity using an shRNA approach, termed P19[shb-cat] cells. The loss of b-catenin resulted in a reduction of skeletal myogenesis in the absence of RA as early as premyogenic mesoderm, with the loss of Pax3/7, Eya2, Six1, Meox1, Gli2, Foxc1/2, and Sox7 transcript levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation identified an association of b-catenin with the promoter region of the Sox7 gene. Differentiation of P19[shb-cat] cells in the presence of RA resulted in the upregulation or lack of repression of all of the precursor genes, on day 5 and/or 9, with the exception of Foxc2. However, expression of Sox7, Gli2, the myogenic regulatory factors and terminal differentiation markers remained inhibited on day 9 and overall skeletal myogenesis was reduced. Thus, b-catenin is essential for in vitro formation of premyogenic mesoderm, leading to skeletal myogenesis. RA can at least partially compensate for the loss of b-catenin in the expression of many myogenic precursor genes, but not for myoblast gene expression or overall myogenesis.

23474756|t|Aberrant Mer receptor tyrosine kinase expression contributes to leukemogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia.
23474756|a|Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to be extremely difficult to treat successfully, and the unacceptably low overall survival rates mandate that we assess new potential therapies to ameliorate poor clinical response to conventional therapy. Abnormal tyrosine kinase activation in AML has been associated with poor prognosis and provides strategic targets for novel therapy development. We found that Mer receptor tyrosine kinase was over-expressed in a majority of pediatric (29/36, 80%) and adult (10/10, 100%) primary AML patient blasts at the time of diagnosis, and 100% of patient samples at the time of relapse. Mer was also found to be expressed in 12 of 14 AML cell lines (86%). In contrast, normal bone marrow myeloid precursors expressed little to no Mer. Following AML cell line stimulation with Gas6, a Mer ligand, we observed activation of prosurvival and proliferative signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, MSK1, CREB, ATF1, AKT and STAT6. To assess the phenotypic role of Mer in AML, two independent short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were used to decrease Mer expression in the AML cell lines Nomo-1 and Kasumi-1. Reduction of Mer protein levels significantly increased rates of myeloblast apoptosis two to threefold in response to serum starvation. Furthermore, myeloblasts with knocked-down Mer demonstrated decreased colony formation by 67-87%, relative to control cell lines (P<0.01). NOD-SCID-gamma mice transplanted with Nomo-1 myeloblasts with reduced levels of Mer had a significant prolongation in survival compared with mice transplanted with the parental or control cell lines (median survival 17 days in parental and control cell lines, versus 32-36 days in Mer knockdown cell lines, P<0.0001). These data suggest a role for Mer in acute myeloid leukemogenesis and indicate that targeted inhibition of Mer may be an effective therapeutic strategy in pediatric and adult AML.

23630352|t|OX40L/Jagged1 cosignaling by GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived dendritic cells is required for the expansion of functional regulatory T cells.
23630352|a|Earlier, we had demonstrated that treatment with low dose of GM-CSF can prevent the development of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT), experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, and type 1 diabetes, and could also reverse ongoing EAT and experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. The protective effect was mediated through the induction of tolerogenic CD11C(+)CD8a(-) dendritic cells (DCs) and consequent expansion of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs). Subsequently, we showed that GM-CSF acted specifically on bone marrow precursors and facilitated their differentiation into tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs; GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived DCs [GM-BMDCs]), which directed Treg expansion in a contact-dependent manner. This novel mechanism of Treg expansion was independent of TCR-mediated signaling but required exogenous IL-2 and cosignaling from DC-bound OX40L. In this study, we observed that OX40L-mediated signaling by GM-BMDCs, although necessary, was not sufficient for Treg expansion and required signaling by Jagged1. Concurrent signaling induced by OX40L and Jagged1 via OX40 and Notch3 receptors expressed on Tregs was essential for the Treg expansion with sustained FoxP3 expression. Adoptive transfer of only OX40L(+)Jagged1(+) BMDCs led to Treg expansion, increased production of IL-4 and IL-10, and suppression of EAT in the recipient mice. These results showed a critical role for OX40L- and Jagged1-induced cosignaling in GM-BMDC-induced Treg expansion.

23752226|t|AP4 is a mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in colorectal cancer.
23752226|a|The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor AP4/TFAP4/AP-4 is encoded by a c-MYC target gene and displays up-regulation concomitantly with c-MYC in colorectal cancer (CRC) and numerous other tumor types. Here a genome-wide characterization of AP4 DNA binding and mRNA expression was performed using a combination of microarray, genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses. Thereby, hundreds of induced and repressed AP4 target genes were identified. Besides many genes involved in the control of proliferation, the AP4 target genes included markers of stemness (LGR5 and CD44) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) such as SNAIL, E-cadherin/CDH1, OCLN, VIM, FN1, and the Claudins 1, 4, and 7. Accordingly, activation of AP4 induced EMT and enhanced migration and invasion of CRC cells. Conversely, down-regulation of AP4 resulted in mesenchymal-epithelial transition and inhibited migration and invasion. In addition, AP4 induction was required for EMT, migration, and invasion caused by ectopic expression of c-MYC. Inhibition of AP4 in CRC cells resulted in decreased lung metastasis in mice. Elevated AP4 expression in primary CRC significantly correlated with liver metastasis and poor patient survival. These findings imply AP4 as a new regulator of EMT that contributes to metastatic processes in CRC and presumably other carcinomas.

23775080|t|Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2) p45-related factor-2 (Nrf2) modulates dendritic cell immune function through regulation of p38 MAPK-cAMP-responsive element binding protein/activating transcription factor 1 signaling.
23775080|a|Nrf2 is a redox-responsive transcription factor that has been implicated in the regulation of DC immune function. Loss of Nrf2 results in increased co-stimulatory molecule expression, enhanced T cell stimulatory capacity, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in murine immature DCs (iDCs). It is unknown whether altered immune function of Nrf2-deficient DCs (Nrf2(-/-) iDCs) is due to elevated ROS levels. Furthermore, it is unclear which intracellular signaling pathways are involved in Nrf2-mediated regulation of DC function. Using antioxidant vitamins to reset ROS levels in Nrf2(-/-) iDCs, we show that elevated ROS is not responsible for the altered phenotype and function of these DCs. Pharmacological inhibitors were used to explore the role of key MAPKs in mediating the altered phenotype and function in Nrf2(-/-) iDCs. We demonstrate that the increased co-stimulatory molecule expression (MHC II and CD86) and antigen-specific T cell activation capacity observed in Nrf2(-/-) iDCs was reversed by inhibition of p38 MAPK but not JNK. Importantly, we provide evidence for increased phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), transcription factors that are downstream of p38 MAPK. The increased phosphorylation of CREB/ATF1 in Nrf2(-/-) iDCs was sensitive to p38 MAPK inhibition. We also show data to implicate heme oxygenase-1 as a potential molecular link between Nrf2 and CREB/ATF1. These results indicate that dysregulation of p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 signaling axis underlies the altered function and phenotype in Nrf2-deficient DCs. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which Nrf2 mediates regulation of DC function.

23791840|t|Superoxide dismutase 1 overexpression in mice abolishes maternal diabetes-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in diabetic embryopathy.
23791840|a|OBJECTIVE: Both oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) are causal events in diabetic embryopathy. We tested whether oxidative stress causes ER stress. STUDY DESIGN: Wild-type (WT) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-overexpressing day 8.75 embryos from nondiabetic WT control with SOD1 transgenic male and diabetic WT female with SOD1 transgenic male were analyzed for ER stress markers: C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), calnexin, eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a), protein kinase ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like ER kinase (PERK), binding immunoglobulin protein, protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3, kinases inositol-requiring protein-1a (IRE1a), and the X-box binding protein (XBP1) messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. RESULTS: Maternal diabetes significantly increased the levels of CHOP, calnexin, phosphorylated (p)-eIF2a, p-PERK, and p-IRE1a; triggered XBP1 mRNA splicing; and enhanced ER chaperone gene expression in WT embryos. SOD1 overexpression blocked these diabetes-induced ER stress markers. CONCLUSION: Mitigating oxidative stress via SOD1 overexpression blocks maternal diabetes-induced ER stress in vivo.

23860123|t|Tcf19 is a novel islet factor necessary for proliferation and survival in the INS-1 b-cell line.
23860123|a|Recently, a novel type 1 diabetes association locus was identified at human chromosome 6p31.3, and transcription factor 19 (TCF19) is a likely causal gene. Little is known about Tcf19, and we now show that it plays a role in both proliferation and apoptosis in insulinoma cells. Tcf19 is expressed in mouse and human islets, with increasing mRNA expression in nondiabetic obesity. The expression of Tcf19 is correlated with b-cell mass expansion, suggesting that it may be a transcriptional regulator of b-cell mass. Increasing proliferation and decreasing apoptotic cell death are two strategies to increase pancreatic b-cell mass and prevent or delay diabetes. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Tcf19 in the INS-1 insulinoma cell line, a b-cell model, results in a decrease in proliferation and an increase in apoptosis. There was a significant reduction in the expression of numerous cell cycle genes from the late G1 phase through the M phase, and cells were arrested at the G1/S checkpoint. We also observed increased apoptosis and susceptibility to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after Tcf19 knockdown. There was a reduction in expression of genes important for the maintenance of ER homeostasis (Bip, p58(IPK), Edem1, and calreticulin) and an increase in proapoptotic genes (Bim, Bid, Nix, Gadd34, and Pdia2). Therefore, Tcf19 is necessary for both proliferation and survival and is a novel regulator of these pathways.

23966295|t|Activation of MAPK pathways due to DUSP4 loss promotes cancer stem cell-like phenotypes in basal-like breast cancer.
23966295|a|Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is an aggressive disease that lacks a clinically approved targeted therapy. Traditional chemotherapy is effective in BLBC, but it spares the cancer stem cell (CSC)-like population, which is likely to contribute to cancer recurrence after the initial treatment. Dual specificity phosphatase-4 (DUSP4) is a negative regulator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that is deficient in highly aggressive BLBCs treated with chemotherapy, leading to aberrant MAPK activation and resistance to taxane-induced apoptosis. Herein, we investigated how DUSP4 regulates the MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) and c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) pathways in modifying CSC-like behavior. DUSP4 loss increased mammosphere formation and the expression of the CSC-promoting cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. These effects were caused in part by loss of control of the MEK and JNK pathways and involved downstream activation of the ETS-1 and c-JUN transcription factors. Enforced expression of DUSP4 reduced the CD44(+)/CD24(-) population in multiple BLBC cell lines in a MEK-dependent manner, limiting tumor formation of claudin-low SUM159PT cells in mice. Our findings support the evaluation of MEK and JNK pathway inhibitors as therapeutic agents in BLBC to eliminate the CSC population.

24036311|t|CTR9/PAF1c regulates molecular lineage identity, histone H3K36 trimethylation and genomic imprinting during preimplantation development.
24036311|a|Genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming is required for successful preimplantation development. Inappropriate or deficient chromatin regulation can result in defective lineage specification and loss of genomic imprinting, compromising normal development. Here we report that two members of the RNA polymerase II associated factor, homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) complex (PAF1 complex) components, Ctr9 and Rtf1, are required during mammalian preimplantation development. We demonstrate that Ctr9-deficient embryos fail to correctly specify lineages at the blastocyst stage. Expression of some lineage specific factors is markedly reduced in Ctr9 knockdown embryos, including Eomes, Elf5 and Sox2, while others are inappropriately expressed (Oct4, Nanog, Gata6, Fgf4 and Sox17). We also show that several imprinted genes (Mest, Peg3, Snrpn and Meg3) are aberrantly expressed although allele specific DNA methylation is not altered. We document a loss of histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) in Ctr9-deficient embryos and confirm that knockdown of either Setd2 or Rtf1 results in similar phenotypes. These findings show that the PAF1 complex is required for mammalian development, likely through regulation of H3K36me3, and indicate functional conservation of the PAF1 complex from yeast to mammals in vivo.

24058610|t|Mechanical ventilation enhances HMGB1 expression in an LPS-induced lung injury model.
24058610|a|BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV) can augment inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenged lungs. High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a pro-inflammatory mediator in ventilator-induced lung injury, but its mechanisms are not well defined. This study investigated the role of HMGB1 in lung inflammation in response to the combination of MV and LPS treatment. METHODS: Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to one of four groups: sham control; LPS treatment; mechanical ventilation; mechanical ventilation with LPS treatment. Mechanically ventilated animals received 10 ml/kg tidal volumes at a rate of 40 breaths/min for 4 h. In the HMGB1-blockade study, sixteen rats were randomly assigned to HMGB1 antibody group or control antibody group and animals were subjected to MV+LPS as described above. A549 cells were pre-incubated with different signal inhibitors before subjected to 4 h of cyclic stretch. Lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio, total protein and IgG concentration, number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung histological changes were examined. The levels of interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and HMGB1 in BALF were measured using ELISA. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to analyze mRNA and protein expression of HMGB1. Western blot were employed to analyze the activation of IkB-a, NF-kB, JNK, ERK, and p38. RESULTS: MV significantly augmented LPS-induced lung injury and HMGB1 expression, which was correlated with the increase in IL-1b, IL-6 and MIP-2 levels in BALF. In vivo, intratracheally administration of HMGB1 antibody significantly attenuated pulmonary inflammatory injury. In vitro experiments showed cyclic stretch induced HMGB1 expression through signaling pathways including p38 and NF-kB. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that moderate tidal volume MV augmented LPS induced lung injury by up-regulating HMGB1. The mechanism of HMGB1-mediated lung injury is likely to be signaling through p38 and NF-kB pathways.

24223959|t|Protective roles of interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) in dengue virus infection of human lung epithelial cells.
24223959|a|Interferons (IFNs) are critical cytokines that regulate immune response against virus infections. Dengue virus (DV) infections are a major public health concern worldwide, and especially in Asia. In the present study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of action of IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) in human lung epithelial cells. The results demonstrated that DV infection induced expression of several IFITs, including IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFIT5 in A549 cells. Induction of IFIT3 by DV infection was also observed in human dendritic cells. In a knockdown study, we showed that a signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2), but not STAT1 or STAT3, regulated DV-induced IFIT3 production. By using several different methods to evaluate cell death, we demonstrated that knockdown of IFIT3 led to cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of IFIT3 induced the expression of several apoptotic regulators such as caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX). Such apoptotic effects and mechanisms were synergistically enhanced after DV infection. Moreover, under conditions of IFIT3 deficiency, viral production increased, suggesting an anti-viral effect of IFIT3. Interestingly, DV could suppress IFN-a-induced but not IFN-g-induced IFIT3 expression, a phenomenon similar to the regulation of STATs by DV. In conclusion, this study revealed some mechanisms of IFIT3 induction, and also demonstrated the protective roles of IFIT3 following IFN-a production in DV infection of human lung epithelial cells.

24321498|t|Toll-like receptor signaling adapter proteins govern spread of neuropathic pain and recovery following nerve injury in male mice.
24321498|a|BACKGROUND: Spinal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and signaling intermediaries have been implicated in persistent pain states. We examined the roles of two major TLR signaling pathways and selected TLRs in a mononeuropathic allodynia. METHODS: L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) was performed in wild type (WT, C57BL/6) male and female mice and in male Tlr2-/-Tlr3-/-, Tlr4-/-, Tlr5-/-, Myd88-/-, Triflps2, Myd88/Triflps2, Tnf-/-, and Ifnar1-/- mice. We also examined L5 ligation in Tlr4-/- female mice. We examined tactile allodynia using von Frey hairs. Iba-1 (microglia) and GFAP (astrocytes) were assessed in spinal cords by immunostaining. Tactile thresholds were analyzed by 1- and 2-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni post hoc test was used. RESULTS: In WT male and female mice, SNL lesions resulted in a persistent and robust ipsilateral, tactile allodynia. In males with TLR2, 3, 4, or 5 deficiencies, tactile allodynia was significantly, but incompletely, reversed (approximately 50%) as compared to WT. This effect was not seen in female Tlr4-/- mice. Increases in ipsilateral lumbar Iba-1 and GFAP were seen in mutant and WT mice. Mice deficient in MyD88, or MyD88 and TRIF, showed an approximately 50% reduction in withdrawal thresholds and reduced ipsilateral Iba-1. In contrast, TRIF and interferon receptor null mice developed a profound ipsilateral and contralateral tactile allodynia. In lumbar sections of the spinal cords, we observed a greater increase in Iba-1 immunoreactivity in the TRIF-signaling deficient mice as compared to WT, but no significant increase in GFAP. Removing MyD88 abrogated the contralateral allodynia in the TRIF signaling-deficient mice. Conversely, IFNb, released downstream to TRIF signaling, administered intrathecally, temporarily reversed the tactile allodynia. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest a critical role for the MyD88 pathway in initiating neuropathic pain, but a distinct role for the TRIF pathway and interferon in regulating neuropathic pain phenotypes in male mice.

24387290|t|XB130 promotes proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells.
24387290|a|BACKGROUND: XB130 has been reported to be expressed by various types of cells such as thyroid cancer and esophageal cancer cells, and it promotes the proliferation and invasion of thyroid cancer cells. Our previous study demonstrated that XB130 is also expressed in gastric cancer (GC), and that its expression is associated with the prognosis, but the role of XB130 in GC has not been well characterized. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the influence of XB130 on gastric tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo and in vitro using the MTT assay, clonogenic assay, BrdU incorporation assay, 3D culture, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Western blot analysis was also performed to identify the potential mechanisms involved. RESULTS: The proliferation, migration, and invasion of SGC7901 and MNK45 gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines were all significantly inhibited by knockdown of XB130 using small hairpin RNA. In a xenograft model, tumor growth was markedly inhibited after shXB130-transfected GC cells were implanted into nude mice. After XB130 knockdown, GC cells showed a more epithelial-like phenotype, suggesting an inhibition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In addition, silencing of XB130 reduced the expression of p-Akt/Akt, upregulated expression of epithelial markers including E-cadherin, a-catenin and b-catenin, and downregulated mesenchymal markers including fibronectin and vimentin. Expression of oncoproteins related to tumor metastasis, such as MMP2, MMP9, and CD44, was also significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that XB130 enhances cell motility and invasiveness by modulating the EMT-like process, while silencing XB130 in GC suppresses tumorigenesis and metastasis, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic target.

24402617|t|Mycobacterium massiliense induces inflammatory responses in macrophages through Toll-like receptor 2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase.
24402617|a|Mycobacterium massiliense (Mmass) is an emerging, rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM) that belongs to the M. abscessus (Mabc) group, albeit clearly differentiated from Mabc. Compared with M. tuberculosis, a well-characterized human pathogen, the host innate immune response against Mmass infection is largely unknown. In this study, we show that Mmass robustly activates mRNA and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-6 in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), but neither TLR4 nor Dectin-1, are involved in Mmass-induced TNF-a or IL-6 production in BMDMs. Mmass infection also activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs; c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK) pathway. Mmass-induced TNF-a and IL-6 production was dependent on JNK activation, while they were unaffected by either the ERK1/2 or p38 pathway in BMDMs. Additionally, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), NADPH oxidase-2, and nuclear factor-kB are required for Mmass-induced proinflammatory cytokine generation in macrophages. Furthermore, the S morphotype of Mmass showed lower overall induction of pro-inflammatory (TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines than the R morphotype, suggesting fewer immunogenic characteristics for this clinical strain. Together, these results suggest that Mmass-induced activation of host proinflammatory cytokines is mediated through TLR2-dependent JNK and ROS signaling pathways.

24623966|t|Endothelial NADPH oxidase 4 mediates vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-induced intravitreal neovascularization in a rat model of retinopathy of prematurity.
24623966|a|PURPOSE: NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in angiogenesis. Isoforms of NADPH oxidase NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 are reported to be expressed in endothelial cells (ECs). Of these, NOX1 and NOX2 have been reported to contribute to intravitreal neovascularization (IVNV) in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) models. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the isoform NOX4 in ECs contributed to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis and IVNV. METHODS: Isoforms of NADPH oxidase MRNA were measured in several types of cultured vascular ecs: human retinal microvascular ECs (hRMVECs), choroidal ECs (CECs), and human umbilical vascular ECs (HUVECs) using real-time PCR. Newborn rat pups and dams were placed into an OIR model that cycled oxygen concentration between 50% and 10% every 24 h for 14 days, and then were placed in room air (RA) for an additional 4 days (rat OIR model). NOX4 expression in retinal lysates from the RA-raised pups at postnatal day 0 (P0), P14, and P18 was determined with western blots. STAT3 activation was determined as the ratio of phosphorylated STAT3 to total STAT3 with western blot analysis of retinal lysates from pups raised in RA or from the rat OIR model at P18. Semiquantitative assessment of the density of NOX4 colabeling with lectin-stained retinal ECs was determined by immunolabeling of retinal cryosections from P18 pups in OIR or in RA. In hRMVECs transfected with NOX4 siRNA and treated with VEGF or control, 1) ROS generation was measured using the 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester fluorescence assay and 2) phosphorylated VEGF receptor 2 and STAT3, and total VEGFR2 and STAT3 were measured in western blot analyses. VEGF-stimulated hRMVEC proliferation was measured following transfection with NOX4 siRNA or STAT3 siRNA, or respective controls. RESULTS: NOX4 was the most prevalent isoform of NADPH oxidase in vascular ECs. NOX4 expression in retinal lysates was significantly decreased during development in RA. Compared to RA, the expression of retinal NOX4 increased at P18. At p18 OIR, semiquantitative assessment of the density of lectin and NOX4 colabeling in retinal vascular ECs was greater in retinal cryosections and activated STAT3 was greater in retinal lysates when compared to the RA-raised pups. In cultured hRMVECs, knockdown of NOX4 by siRNA transfection inhibited VEGF-induced ROS generation. VEGF induced a physical interaction of phosphorylated-VEGFR2 and NOX4. Knockdown of NOX4: 1) reduced VEGFR2 activation but did not abolish it and 2) abolished STAT3 activation in response to VEGF. Knockdown of either NOX4 or STAT3 inhibited VEGF-induced EC proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in a model representative of human retinopathy of prematurity, NOX4 was increased at a time point when IVNV developed. VEGF-activated NOX4 led to an interaction between VEGF-activated VEGFR2 and NOX4 that mediated EC proliferation via activation of STAT3. Altogether, our results suggest that NOX4 may regulate VEGFR2-mediated IVNV through activated STAT3.

24643644|t|Large multiethnic Candidate Gene Study for C-reactive protein levels: identification of a novel association at CD36 in African Americans.
24643644|a|C-reactive protein (CRP) is a heritable biomarker of systemic inflammation and a predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Large-scale genetic association studies for CRP have largely focused on individuals of European descent. We sought to uncover novel genetic variants for CRP in a multiethnic sample using the ITMAT Broad-CARe (IBC) array, a custom 50,000 SNP gene-centric array having dense coverage of over 2,000 candidate CVD genes. We performed analyses on 7,570 African Americans (AA) from the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) study and race-combined meta-analyses that included 29,939 additional individuals of European descent from CARe, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and KORA studies. We observed array-wide significance (p < 2.2 x 10(-6)) for four loci in AA, three of which have been reported previously in individuals of European descent (IL6R, p = 2.0 x 10(-6); CRP, p = 4.2 x 10(-71); APOE, p = 1.6 x 10(-6)). The fourth significant locus, CD36 (p = 1.6 x 10(-6)), was observed at a functional variant (rs3211938) that is extremely rare in individuals of European descent. We replicated the CD36 finding (p = 1.8 x 10(-5)) in an independent sample of 8,041 AA women from WHI; a meta-analysis combining the CARe and WHI AA results at rs3211938 reached genome-wide significance (p = 1.5 x 10(-10)). In the race-combined meta-analyses, 13 loci reached significance, including ten (CRP, TOMM40/APOE/APOC1, HNF1A, LEPR, GCKR, IL6R, IL1RN, NLRP3, HNF4A and BAZ1B/BCL7B) previously associated with CRP, and one (ARNTL) previously reported to be nominally associated with CRP. Two novel loci were also detected (RPS6KB1, p = 2.0 x 10(-6); CD36, p = 1.4 x 10(-6)). These results highlight both shared and unique genetic risk factors for CRP in AA compared to populations of European descent.

24694877|t|Embelin suppresses growth of human pancreatic cancer xenografts, and pancreatic cancer cells isolated from KrasG12D mice by inhibiting Akt and Sonic hedgehog pathways.
24694877|a|Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease, and therefore effective treatment and/or prevention strategies are urgently needed. The objectives of this study were to examine the molecular mechanisms by which embelin inhibited human pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro, and xenografts in Balb C nude mice, and pancreatic cancer cell growth isolated from KrasG12D transgenic mice. XTT assays were performed to measure cell viability. AsPC-1 cells were injected subcutaneously into Balb c nude mice and treated with embelin. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by Ki67 and TUNEL staining, respectively. The expression of Akt, and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and their target gene products were measured by the immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. The effects of embelin on pancreatic cancer cells isolated from 10-months old KrasG12D mice were also examined. Embelin inhibited cell viability in pancreatic cancer AsPC-1, PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and Hs 766T cell lines, and these inhibitory effects were blocked either by constitutively active Akt or Shh protein. Embelin-treated mice showed significant inhibition in tumor growth which was associated with reduced expression of markers of cell proliferation (Ki67, PCNA and Bcl-2) and cell cycle (cyclin D1, CDK2, and CDK6), and induction of apoptosis (activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP, and increased expression of Bax). In addition, embelin inhibited the expression of markers of angiogenesis (COX-2, VEGF, VEGFR, and IL-8), and metastasis (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in tumor tissues. Antitumor activity of embelin was associated with inhibition of Akt and Shh pathways in xenografts, and pancreatic cancer cells isolated from KrasG12D mice. Furthermore, embelin also inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by up-regulating E-cadherin and inhibiting the expression of Snail, Slug, and ZEB1. These data suggest that embelin can inhibit pancreatic cancer growth, angiogenesis and metastasis by suppressing Akt and Shh pathways, and can be developed for the treatment and/or prevention of pancreatic cancer.

24705272|t|Reversal of ischemic cardiomyopathy with Sca-1+ stem cells modified with multiple growth factors.
24705272|a|BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that bone marrow derived Sca-1+ stem cells (BM Sca-1+) transduced with multiple therapeutic cytokines with diverse effects will induce faster angiomyogenic differentiation in the infarcted myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS: BM Sca-1+ were purified from transgenic male mice expressing GFP. Plasmids encoding for select quartet of growth factors, i.e., human IGF-1, VEGF, SDF-1a and HGF were prepared and used for genetic modification of Sca-1+ cells (GFSca-1+). Scramble transfected cells (ScSca-1+) were used as a control. RT-PCR and western blotting showed significantly higher expression of the growth factors in GFSca-1+. Besides the quartet of the therapeutic growth factors, PCR based growth factor array showed upregulation of multiple angiogenic and prosurvival factors such as Ang-1, Ang-2, MMP9, Cx43, BMP2, BMP5, FGF2, and NGF in GFSca-1+ (p<0.01 vs ScSca-1+). LDH and TUNEL assays showed enhanced survival of GFSca-1+ under lethal anoxia (p<0.01 vs ScSca-1+). MTS assay showed significant increased cell proliferation in GFSca-1+ (p<0.05 vs ScSca-1+). For in vivo study, female mice were grouped to receive the intramyocardial injection of 15 ul DMEM without cells (group-1) or containing 2.5 x 10(5) ScSca-1+ (group-2) or GFSca-1+ (group-3) immediately after coronary artery ligation. As indicated by Sry gene, a higher survival of GFSca-1+ in group-3 on day 4 (2.3 fold higher vs group-2) was observed with massive mobilization of stem and progenitor cells (cKit+, Mdr1+, Cxcr4+ cells). Heart tissue sections immunostained for actinin and Cx43 at 4 weeks post engraftment showed extensive myofiber formation and expression of gap junctions. Immunostaining for vWF showed increased blood vessel density in both peri-infarct and infarct regions in group-3. Infarct size was attenuated and the global heart function was improved in group-3 as compared to group-2. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of BM Sca-1+ transduced with multiple genes is a novel approach to treat infarcted heart for its regeneration.

24743235|t|IL-3 and CSF-1 interact to promote generation of CD11c+ IL-10-producing macrophages.
24743235|a|Unraveling the mechanisms of hematopoiesis regulated by multiple cytokines remains a challenge in hematology. IL-3 is an allergic cytokine with the multilineage potential, while CSF-1 is produced in the steady state with restricted lineage coverage. Here, we uncovered an instructive role of CSF-1 in IL-3-mediated hematopoiesis. CSF-1 significantly promoted IL-3-driven CD11c+ cell expansion and dampened basophil and mast cell generation from C57BL/6 bone marrow. Further studies indicated that the CSF-1/CSF-1R axis contributed significantly to IL-3-induced CD11c+ cell generation through enhancing c-Fos-associated monopoiesis. CD11c+ cells induced by IL-3 or IL-3/CSF-1 were competent in cellular maturation and endocytosis. Both IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1 cells lacked classical dendritic cell appearance and resembled macrophages in morphology. Both populations produced a high level of IL-10, in addition to IL-1, IL-6 and TNFa, in response to LPS, and were relatively poor T cell stimulators. Collectively, these findings reveal a role for CSF-1 in mediating the IL-3 hematopoietic pathway through monopoiesis, which regulates expansion of CD11c+ macrophages.

25086780|t|Postnatal exposure to a high-carbohydrate diet interferes epigenetically with thyroid hormone receptor induction of the adult male rat skeletal muscle glucose transporter isoform 4 expression.
25086780|a|Early life nutritional intervention causes adult-onset insulin resistance and obesity in rats. Thyroid hormone receptor (TR), in turn, transcriptionally enhances skeletal muscle Glut4 expression. We tested the hypothesis that reduced circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone and T4 concentrations encountered in postnatal (PN4-PN24) high-carbohydrate (HC) milk formula-fed versus the mother-fed controls (MF) would epigenetically interfere with TR induction of adult (100 days) male rat skeletal muscle Glut4 expression, thereby providing a molecular mechanism mediating insulin resistance. We observed increased DNA methylation of the CpG island with enhanced recruitment of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and MeCP2 in the glut4 promoter region along with reduced acetylation of histone (H)2A.Z and H4 particularly at the H4.lysine (K)16 residue, which was predominantly mediated by histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). This was followed by enhanced recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1b to the glut4 promoter with increased Suv39H1 methylase concentrations. These changes reduced TR binding of the T3 response element of the glut4 gene (TREs; -473 to -450 bp) detected qualitatively in vivo (electromobility shift assay) and quantified ex vivo (chromatin immunoprecipitation). In addition, the recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator and CREB-binding protein to the glut4 promoter-protein complex was reduced. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction between TR and CBP to be reduced and HDAC4 to be enhanced in HC versus MF groups. These molecular changes were associated with diminished skeletal muscle Glut4 mRNA and protein concentrations. We conclude that early postnatal exposure to HC diet epigenetically reduced TR induction of adult male skeletal muscle Glut4 expression, uncovering novel molecular mechanisms contributing to adult insulin resistance and obesity.

25128964|t|Twist 1 regulates the expression of PPARg during hormone-induced 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation: a possible role in obesity and associated diseases.
25128964|a|BACKGROUND: Twist 1 is highly expressed in adipose tissue and has been associated with obesity and related disorders. However, the molecular function of Twist 1 in adipose tissue is unclear. Twist 1 has been implicated in cell lineage determination and differentiation. Therefore, we investigated both the role of Twist 1 in adipocyte precursor mobilization and the relationship of Twist 1 with other molecular determinants of adipocyte differentiation. METHODS: We examined Twist 1 mRNA and protein expression in subcutaneous adipose tissues from diet-induced obese C57/BL6 mice and Wistar rats and in obese patients undergoing liposuction or adipose transplant surgeries. Twist 1 expression was measured on days 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 of 3T3-L1 differentiation in vitro. The role of Twist 1 in adipogenesis was explored using retroviral interference of Twist 1 expression. Adipokine secretion was evaluated using a RayBioR Biotin Label-based Adipokine Array. RESULTS: Twist 1 mRNA and protein levels were reduced in diet-induced obese mice and rats and in obese humans. Twist 1 was upregulated during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation in vitro, beginning from the fourth day of differentiation induction. Retroviral interference of Twist 1 expression did not significantly impair lipid formation; however, retroviral interference induced PPARg mRNA and protein expression on day 4 of differentiation induction. Adipokine array analyses revealed increased secretion of CXCR4 (19.55-fold), VEGFR1 (92.13-fold), L-21 R (63.55-fold), and IL-12 R beta 1 (59.66-fold) and decreased secretion of VEGFR3 (0.01-fold), TSLP R (0.071-fold), MIP-1 gamma (0.069-fold), TNF RI/TNFRSF1A (0.09-fold), and MFG-E8 (0.06-fold). CONCLUSIONS: Twist 1 is a regulator of adipocyte gene expression although it is not likely to regulate differentiation. We identified PPARg as a potential target of Twist 1 and found variation in the secretion of multiple adipokines, which might indicate a prospective mechanism linking Twist 1 expression with obesity or associated diseases.

25211016|t|RBFOX1 cooperates with MBNL1 to control splicing in muscle, including events altered in myotonic dystrophy type 1.
25211016|a|With the goal of identifying splicing alterations in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) tissues that may yield insights into targets or mechanisms, we have surveyed mis-splicing events in three systems using a RT-PCR screening and validation platform. First, a transgenic mouse model expressing CUG-repeats identified splicing alterations shared with other mouse models of DM1. Second, using cell cultures from human embryonic muscle, we noted that DM1-associated splicing alterations were significantly enriched in cytoskeleton (e.g. SORBS1, TACC2, TTN, ACTN1 and DMD) and channel (e.g. KCND3 and TRPM4) genes. Third, of the splicing alterations occurring in adult DM1 tissues, one produced a dominant negative variant of the splicing regulator RBFOX1. Notably, half of the splicing events controlled by MBNL1 were co-regulated by RBFOX1, and several events in this category were mis-spliced in DM1 tissues. Our results suggest that reduced RBFOX1 activity in DM1 tissues may amplify several of the splicing alterations caused by the deficiency in MBNL1.

25277705|t|Leukemia inhibitory factor protects the lung during respiratory syncytial viral infection.
25277705|a|BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects the lung epithelium where it stimulates the production of numerous host cytokines that are associated with disease burden and acute lung injury. Characterizing the host cytokine response to RSV infection, the regulation of host cytokines and the impact of neutralizing an RSV-inducible cytokine during infection were undertaken in this study. METHODS: A549, primary human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and wild-type, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (Mavs) knockout (KO) mice were infected with RSV and cytokine responses were investigated by ELISA, multiplex analysis and qPCR. Neutralizing anti-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) IgG or control IgG was administered to a group of wild-type animals prior to RSV infection. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: RSV-infected A549 and SAE cells release a network of cytokines, including newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines LIF, migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-b). These RSV-inducible cytokines were also observed in the airways of mice during an infection. To identify the regulation of RSV inducible cytokines, Mavs and Trif deficient animals were infected with RSV. In vivo induction of airway IL-1b, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IFN-g, CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CXCL1, IP-10/CXCL10, IL-22, MIG/CXCL9 and MIF were dependent on Mavs expression in mice. Loss of Trif expression in mice altered the RSV induction of IL-1b, IL-5, CXCL12, MIF, LIF, CXCL12 and IFN-g. Silencing of retinoic acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) expression in A549 cells had a greater impact on RSV-inducible cytokines than melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), and Trif expression. To evaluate the role of LIF in the airways during RSV infection, animals were treated with neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, which enhanced RSV pathology observed with increased airspace protein content, apoptosis and airway hyperresponsiveness compared to control IgG treatment. CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection in the epithelium induces a network of immune factors to counter infection, primarily in a RIG-I dependent manner. Expression of LIF protects the lung from lung injury and enhanced pathology during RSV infection.

25315346|t|Rac1 signaling is critical to cardiomyocyte polarity and embryonic heart development.
25315346|a|BACKGROUND: Defects in cardiac septation are the most common form of congenital heart disease, but the mechanisms underlying these defects are still poorly understood. The small GTPase Rac1 is implicated in planar cell polarity of epithelial cells in Drosophila; however, its role in mammalian cardiomyocyte polarity is not clear. We tested the hypothesis that Rac1 signaling in the second heart field regulates cardiomyocyte polarity, chamber septation, and right ventricle development during embryonic heart development. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice with second heart field-specific deficiency of Rac1 (Rac1(SHF)) exhibited ventricular and atrial septal defects, a thinner right ventricle myocardium, and a bifid cardiac apex. Fate-mapping analysis showed that second heart field contribution to the interventricular septum and right ventricle was deficient in Rac1(SHF) hearts. Notably, cardiomyocytes had a spherical shape with disrupted F-actin filaments in Rac1(SHF) compared with elongated and well-aligned cardiomyocytes in littermate controls. Expression of Scrib, a core protein in planar cell polarity, was lost in Rac1(SHF) hearts with decreased expression of WAVE and Arp2/3, leading to decreased migratory ability. In addition, Rac1-deficient neonatal cardiomyocytes displayed defects in cell projections, lamellipodia formation, and cell elongation. Furthermore, apoptosis was increased and the expression of Gata4, Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and Hand2 transcription factors was decreased in the Rac1(SHF) right ventricle myocardium. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of Rac1 in the second heart field impairs elongation and cytoskeleton organization of cardiomyocytes and results in congenital septal defects, thin right ventricle myocardium, and a bifid cardiac apex. Our study suggests that Rac1 signaling is critical to cardiomyocyte polarity and embryonic heart development.

25412315|t|BIS targeting induces cellular senescence through the regulation of 14-3-3 zeta/STAT3/SKP2/p27 in glioblastoma cells.
25412315|a|Cellular senescence is an important mechanism for preventing tumor progression. The elevated expression of Bcl-2-interacting cell death suppressor (BIS), an anti-apoptotic and anti-stress protein, often correlates with poor prognosis in several cancers including glioblastoma; however, the role of BIS in the regulation of senescence has not been well defined. Here, we describe for the first time that the depletion of BIS induces G1 arrest and cellular senescence through the accumulation of p27 that is independent of p53, p21 or p16. The increase in p27 expression in BIS-depleted cells was attributable to an impairment of the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p27, which was caused by a decrease in S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) at the transcriptional level. As an underlying molecular mechanism, we demonstrate that the loss of activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was specifically linked to the suppression of SKP2 expression. Despite a reduction in phospho-STAT3 levels, total STAT3 levels were unexpectedly increased by BIS depletion, specifically in the insoluble fraction. Our results show that 14-3-3z expression is decreased by BIS knockdown and that 14-3-3z depletion per se significantly induced senescence phenotypes. In addition, the ectopic expression of 14-3-3z blocked senescence caused by BIS depletion, which was paralleled with a decrease in insoluble STAT3 in A172 glioblastoma cells. These findings indicate that the impairment of the protein quality control conferred by BIS and/or 14-3-3z is critical for BIS depletion-induced senescence. Moreover, BIS knockdown also induced senescence along with an accumulation of total STAT3 and p27 in several different cell types as well as embryonic fibroblasts derived from Bis-knock out mice with/without variations in 14-3-3z levels. Therefore, our findings suggest that a downregulation of BIS expression could serve as a potential strategy for restricting tumor progression via an induction of senescence through the regulation of STAT3/SKP2/p27 pathway.

Thus, we hypothesized that crosstalk between neurons, microglia, and endothelial cells contributes to brain myeloid cell trafficking via chemokine signaling and vascular adhesion molecules. Here we show that social defeat caused an exposure- and brain region-dependent increase in several key adhesion molecules and chemokines involved in the recruitment of myeloid cells. For example, RSD induced distinct patterns of adhesion molecule expression that may explain brain region-dependent myeloid cell trafficking. VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 mRNA expression were increased in an exposure-dependent manner. Furthermore, RSD-induced VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 protein expression were localized to the vasculature of brain regions implicated in fear and anxiety responses, which spatially corresponded to previously reported patterns of myeloid cell trafficking. Next, mRNA expression of additional adhesion molecules (E- and P-selectin, PECAM-1) and chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL12, CCL2) were determined in the brain. Social defeat induced an exposure-dependent increase in mRNA levels of E-selectin, CXCL1, and CXCL2 that increased with additional days of social defeat. While CXCL12 was unaffected by RSD, CCL2 expression was increased by six days of social defeat. Last, comparison between enriched CD11b(+) cells (microglia/macrophages) and enriched GLAST-1(+)/CD11b(-) cells (astrocytes) revealed RSD increased mRNA expression of IL-1b, CCL2, and CXCL2 in microglia/macrophages but not in astrocytes. Collectively, these data indicate that key mediators of leukocyte recruitment were increased in the brain vasculature following RSD in an exposure- and brain region-dependent manner.

25711908|t|Liver fibrosis occurs through dysregulation of MyD88-dependent innate B-cell activity.
25711908|a|Chronic liver disease mediated by activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) leads to liver fibrosis. Here, we postulated that the immune regulatory properties of HSCs might promote the profibrogenic activity of B cells. Fibrosis is completely attenuated in carbon tetrachloride-treated, B cell-deficient uMT mice, showing that B cells are required. The retinoic acid produced by HSCs augmented B-cell survival, plasma cell marker CD138 expression, and immunoglobulin G production. These activities were reversed following addition of the retinoic acid inhibitor LE540. Transcriptional profiling of fibrotic liver B cells revealed increased expression of genes related to activation of nuclear factor k light chain enhancer of activated B cells, proinflammatory cytokine production, and CD40 signaling, suggesting that these B cells are activated and may be acting as inflammatory cells. Biological validation experiments also revealed increased activation (CD44 and CD86 expression), constitutive immunoglobulin G production, and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-a, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1a. Likewise, targeted deletion of B-cell-intrinsic myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 signaling, an innate adaptor with involvement in retinoic acid signaling, resulted in reduced infiltration of migratory CD11c(+) dendritic cells and Ly6C(++) monocytes and, hence, reduced liver pathology. CONCLUSION: Liver fibrosis occurs through a mechanism of HSC-mediated augmentation of innate B-cell activity. These findings highlight B cells as important "first responders" of the intrahepatic immune environment.

25761764|t|Loss of muscleblind-like 1 results in cardiac pathology and persistence of embryonic splice isoforms.
25761764|a|Cardiac dysfunction is a prominent cause of mortality in myotonic dystrophy I (DM1), a disease where expanded CUG repeats bind and disable the muscleblind-like family of splice regulators. Deletion of muscleblind-like 1 (Mbnl1(DE2/DE2)) in 129 sv mice results in QRS, QTc widening, bundle block and STc narrowing at 2-4 months of age. With time, cardiac function deteriorates further and at 6 months, decreased R wave amplitudes, sinus node dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, multi-focal myocardial fiber death and calcification manifest. Sudden death, where no end point illness is overt, is observed at a median age of 6.5 and 4.8 months in ~67% and ~86% of male and female Mbnl1(DE2/DE2) mice, respectively. Mbnl1 depletion results in the persistence of embryonic splice isoforms in a network of cardiac RNAs, some of which have been previously implicated in DM1, regulating sodium and calcium currents, Scn5a, Junctin, Junctate, Atp2a1, Atp11a, Cacna1s, Ryr2, intra and inter cellular transport, Clta, Stx2, Tjp1, cell survival, Capn3, Sirt2, Csda, sarcomere and cytoskeleton organization and function, Trim55, Mapt, Pdlim3, Pdlim5, Sorbs1, Sorbs2, Fhod1, Spag9 and structural components of the sarcomere, Myom1, Tnnt2, Zasp. Thus this study supports a key role for Mbnl1 loss in the initiation of DM1 cardiac disease.

25826077|t|FLT3-ITD confers resistance to the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors by protecting the mTOR/4EBP1/Mcl-1 pathway through STAT5 activation in acute myeloid leukemia.
25826077|a|FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD are the most frequent tyrosine kinase mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with the former associated with poor prognosis. Here, we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 or the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 induced apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway more efficiently in hematopoietic 32D cells driven by FLT3-TKD (32D/TKD) than FLT3-ITD (32D/ITD), which robustly activated STAT5. The resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 was gained by expression of the constitutively activated STAT5 mutant STAT5A1*6 in 32D/TKD cells, while it was abrogated by the STAT5 inhibitor pimozide in 32D/ITD cells or FLT3-ITD-expressing human leukemic MV4-11 cells. GDC-0941 or MK-2206 induced dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 more conspicuously in 32D/TKD than in 32D/ITD, which was prevented or augmented by STAT5A1*6 or pimozide, respectively, and correlated with downregulation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex formation and Mcl-1 expression. Furthermore, exogenous expression of Mcl-1 endowed resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 on 32D/TKD cells. Finally, it was confirmed in primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD that pimozide enhanced 4EBP1 dephosphorylation and Mcl-1 downregulation to augment cytotoxicity of GDC-0941. These data suggest that the robust STAT5 activation by FLT3-ITD protects cells treated with the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors from apoptosis by maintaining Mcl-1 expression through the mTORC1/4EBP1/eIF4E pathway.

25882704|t|CCL20 is elevated during obesity and differentially regulated by NF-kB subunits in pancreatic b-cells.
25882704|a|Enhanced leukocytic infiltration into pancreatic islets contributes to inflammation-based diminutions in functional b-cell mass. Insulitis (aka islet inflammation), which can be present in both T1DM and T2DM, is one factor influencing pancreatic b-cell death and dysfunction. IL-1b, an inflammatory mediator in both T1DM and T2DM, acutely (within 1h) induced expression of the CCL20 gene in rat and human islets and clonal b-cell lines. Transcriptional induction of CCL20 required the p65 subunit of NF-kB to replace the p50 subunit at two functional kB sites within the CCL20 proximal gene promoter. The NF-kB p50 subunit prevents CCL20 gene expression during unstimulated conditions and overexpression of p50 reduces CCL20, but enhances cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), transcript accumulation after exposure to IL-1b. We also identified differential recruitment of specific co-activator molecules to the CCL20 gene promoter, when compared with the CCL2 and COX2 genes, revealing distinct transcriptional requirements for individual NF-kB responsive genes. Moreover, IL-1b, TNF-a and IFN-g individually increased the expression of CCR6, the receptor for CCL20, on the surface of human neutrophils. We further found that the chemokine CCL20 is elevated in serum from both genetically obese db/db mice and in C57BL6/J mice fed a high-fat diet. Taken together, these results are consistent with a possible activation of the CCL20-CCR6 axis in diseases with inflammatory components. Thus, interfering with this signaling pathway, either at the level of NF-kB-mediated chemokine production, or downstream receptor activation, could be a potential therapeutic target to offset inflammation-associated tissue dysfunction in obesity and diabetes.

25884948|t|Lower PRDM2 expression is associated with dopamine-agonist resistance and tumor recurrence in prolactinomas.
25884948|a|BACKGROUND: Dopamine agonists (DAs) are the first-line treatment for prolactinomas, which account for 25-30% of functioning pituitary adenomas, and bromocriptine (BRC) is the only commercially available DAs in China. However, tumors are resistant to therapy in 5-18% of patients. METHODS: The exomes of six responsive prolactinomas and six resistant prolactinomas were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing. RESULTS: Using stringent variant calling and filtering parameters, ten somatic variants that were mainly associated with DNA repair or protein metabolic processes were identified. New resistant variants were identified in multiple genes including PRDM2, PRG4, MUC4, DSPP, DPCR1, RP1L1, MX2, POTEF, C1orf170, and KRTAP10-3. The expression of these genes was then quantified by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) in 12 prolactinomas and 3 normal pituitary glands. The mRNA levels of PRDM2 were approximately five-fold lower in resistant prolactinomas than in responsive tumors (p < 0.05). PRDM2 protein levels were lower in resistant prolactinomas than in responsive tumors, as determined by Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis (p < 0.05). Overexpression of PRDM2 upregulated dopamine receptor D2 (D2DR) and inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MMQ cells. PRDM2 showed a synergistic effect with BRC on the inhibition of prolactin (PRL) secretion and MMQ cell viability, and low PRDM2 expression was associated with tumor recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: PRDM2 downregulation may play a role in dopamine-agonist resistance and tumor recurrence in prolactinomas.

25885470|t|Identification of a unique hepatocellular carcinoma line, Li-7, with CD13(+) cancer stem cells hierarchy and population change upon its differentiation during culture and effects of sorafenib.
25885470|a|BACKGROUNDS: Cancer stem cell (CSC) research has highlighted the necessity of developing drugs targeting CSCs. We investigated a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line that not only has CSC hierarchy but also shows phenotypic changes (population changes) upon differentiation of CSC during culture and can be used for screening drugs targeting CSC. METHODS: Based on a hypothesis that the CSC proportion should decrease upon its differentiation into progenitors (population change), we tested HCC cell lines (HuH-7, Li-7, PLC/PRF/5, HLF, HLE) before and after 2 months culture for several markers (CD13, EpCAM, CD133, CD44, CD90, CD24, CD166). Tumorigenicity was tested using nude mice. To evaluate the CSC hierarchy, we investigated reconstructivity, proliferation, ALDH activity, spheroid formation, chemosensitivity and microarray analysis of the cell populations sorted by FACS. RESULTS: Only Li-7 cells showed a population change during culture: the proportion of CD13 positive cells decreased, while that of CD166 positive cells increased. The high tumorigenicity of the Li-7 was lost after the population change. CD13(+)/CD166(-) cells showed slow growth and reconstructed the bulk Li-7 populations composed of CD13(+)/CD166(-), CD13(-)/CD166(-) and CD13(-)/CD166(+) fractions, whereas CD13(-)/CD166(+) cells showed rapid growth but could not reproduce any other population. CD13(+)/CD166(-) cells showed high ALDH activity, spheroid forming ability and resistance to 5-fluorouracil. Microarray analysis demonstrated higher expression of stemness-related genes in CD166(-) than CD166(+) fraction. These results indicated a hierarchy in Li-7 cells, in which CD13(+)/CD166(-) and CD13(-)/CD166(+) cells serve as slow growing CSCs and rapid growing progenitors, respectively. Sorafenib selectively targeted the CD166(-) fraction, including CD13(+) CSCs, which exhibited higher mRNA expression for FGF3 and FGF4, candidate biomarkers for sorafenib. 5-fluorouracil followed by sorafenib inhibited the growth of bulk Li-7 cells more effectively than the reverse sequence or either alone. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a unique HCC line, Li-7, which not only shows heterogeneity for a CD13(+) CSC hierarchy, but also undergoes a "population change" upon CSC differentiation. Sorafenib targeted the CSC in vitro, supporting the use of this model for screening drugs targeting the CSC. This type of "heterogeneous, unstable" cell line may prove more useful in the CSC era than conventional "homogeneous, stable" cell lines.

25946081|t|Sexual Dimorphism in MAPK-Activated Protein Kinase-2 (MK2) Regulation of RANKL-Induced Osteoclastogenesis in Osteoclast Progenitor Subpopulations.
25946081|a|Osteoclasts (OCs) are bone-resorptive cells critical for maintaining skeletal integrity through coupled bone turnover. OC differentiation and activation requires receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) signaling through the p38 MAPK pathway. However the role of the p38 MAPK substrate, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), is not clearly delineated. Within the bone marrow exists a specific subpopulation of defined osteoclast progenitor cells (dOCPs) with surface expression of B220(-)Gr1(-)CD11b(lo/-)CD115(+) (dOCP(lo/-)). In this study, we isolated dOCPs from male and female mice to determine sex-specific effects of MK2 signaling in osteoclastogenesis (OCgen). Male Mk2(-/-) mice display an increase in the dOCP(lo) cell population when compared to Mk2(+/+) mice, while female Mk2(-/-) and Mk2(+/+ )mice exhibit no difference. Defined OCPs from male and female Mk2(+/+) and Mk2(-/-) bone marrow were treated with macrophage colony stimulation factor (M-CSF) and RANKL cytokines to promote OCgen. RANKL treatment of dOCP(lo) cells stimulated p38 and MK2 phosphorylation. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) assays were used to quantify OC number, size, and TRAP enzyme activity post-RANKL stimulation. MK2 signaling was critical for male dOCP(lo) OCgen, yet MK2 signaling regulated OCgen from female dOCP- and CD11b(hi) subpopulations as well. The functional gene, Ctsk, was attenuated in both male and female Mk2(-/-) dOCP(lo)-derived OCs. Conversely, MK2 signaling was only critical for gene expression of pre-OC fusion genes, Oc-stamp andTm7sf4, in male OCgen. Therefore, these data suggest there is a sexual dimorphism in MK2 signaling of OCP subpopulations.

25946186|t|TIPE2 Inhibits Lung Cancer Growth Attributing to Promotion of Apoptosis by Regulating Some Apoptotic Molecules Expression.
25946186|a|Recent studies found that TIPE2 was involved in cancer development. However, little is known about TIPE2 in lung cancer. Our study aims to clarify the role of TIPE2 in lung carcinogenesis. We examined the expression of TIPE2 in lung squamous cancer (LSC), small cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (AdC) tissues and found that TIPE2 expression was lost in small cell lung cancer, compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. Overexpression of TIPE2 significantly inhibited the growth of lung cancer cell H446 in vitro and even suppressed tumor formation in vivo. Flow cytometry analysis found TIPE2 overexpression promoted apoptosis of H446. In TIPE2 over-expression cells, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax were significantly up-regulated while Bcl-2 was down-regulated. Moreover, coincident results were shown by immunohistochemistry in tumors from nude mice. TIPE2 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, while promoting the phosphorylation of P38, but had no effect on IkBa and ERK pathway. Taken together, TIPE2 promoted lung cancer cell apoptosis through affecting apoptosis-related molecules caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2 and Bax, possibly via regulating P38 and Akt pathways, indicating that TIPE2 might be a novel marker for lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.

26062999|t|Cutting Edge: Dual Function of PPARg in CD11c+ Cells Ensures Immune Tolerance in the Airways.
26062999|a|The respiratory tract maintains immune homeostasis despite constant provocation by environmental Ags. Failure to induce tolerogenic responses to allergens incites allergic inflammation. Despite the understanding that APCs have a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Using mice with a conditional deletion of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg) in CD11c(+) cells, we show that PPARg performs two critical functions in CD11c(+) cells to induce tolerance, thereby preserving immune homeostasis. First, PPARg was crucial for the induction of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh1a2) selectively in CD103(+) dendritic cells, which we recently showed promotes Foxp3 expression in naive CD4(+) T cells. Second, in all CD11c(+) cells, PPARg was required to suppress expression of the Th17-skewing cytokines IL-6 and IL-23p19. Also, lack of PPARg in CD11c(+) cells induced p38 MAPK activity, which was recently linked to Th17 development. Thus, PPARg favors immune tolerance by promoting regulatory T cell generation and blocking Th17 differentiation.

26449539|t|The impact of PPARa activation on whole genome gene expression in human precision cut liver slices.
26449539|a|BACKGROUND: Studies in mice have shown that PPARa is an important regulator of lipid metabolism in liver and key transcription factor involved in the adaptive response to fasting. However, much less is known about the role of PPARa in human liver. METHODS: Here we set out to study the function of PPARa in human liver via analysis of whole genome gene regulation in human liver slices treated with the PPARa agonist Wy14643. RESULTS: Quantitative PCR indicated that PPARa is well expressed in human liver and human liver slices and that the classical PPARa targets PLIN2, VLDLR, ANGPTL4, CPT1A and PDK4 are robustly induced by PPARa activation. Transcriptomics analysis indicated that 617 genes were upregulated and 665 genes were downregulated by PPARa activation (q value < 0.05). Many genes induced by PPARa activation were involved in lipid metabolism (ACSL5, AGPAT9, FADS1, SLC27A4), xenobiotic metabolism (POR, ABCC2, CYP3A5) or the unfolded protein response, whereas most of the downregulated genes were involved in immune-related pathways. Among the most highly repressed genes upon PPARa activation were several chemokines (e.g. CXCL9-11, CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL6), interferon g-induced genes (e.g. IFITM1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) and numerous other immune-related genes (e.g. TLR3, NOS2, and LCN2). Comparative analysis of gene regulation by Wy14643 between human liver slices and primary human hepatocytes showed that down-regulation of gene expression by PPARa is much better captured by liver slices as compared to primary hepatocytes. In particular, PPARa activation markedly suppressed immunity/inflammation-related genes in human liver slices but not in primary hepatocytes. Finally, several putative new target genes of PPARa were identified that were commonly induced by PPARa activation in the two human liver model systems, including TSKU, RHOF, CA12 and VSIG10L. CONCLUSION: Our paper demonstrates the suitability and superiority of human liver slices over primary hepatocytes for studying the functional role of PPARa in human liver. Our data underscore the major role of PPARa in regulation of hepatic lipid and xenobiotic metabolism in human liver and reveal a marked immuno-suppressive/anti-inflammatory effect of PPARa in human liver slices that may be therapeutically relevant for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

26449661|t|UBASH3B/Sts-1-CBL axis regulates myeloid proliferation in human preleukemia induced by AML1-ETO.
26449661|a|The t(8;21) rearrangement, which creates the AML1-ETO fusion protein, represents the most common chromosomal translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Clinical data suggest that CBL mutations are a frequent event in t(8;21) AML, but the role of CBL in AML1-ETO-induced leukemia has not been investigated. In this study, we demonstrate that CBL mutations collaborate with AML1-ETO to expand human CD34+ cells both in vitro and in a xenograft model. CBL depletion by shRNA also promotes the growth of AML1-ETO cells, demonstrating the inhibitory function of endogenous CBL in t(8;21) AML. Mechanistically, loss of CBL function confers hyper-responsiveness to thrombopoietin and enhances STAT5/AKT/ERK/Src signaling in AML1-ETO cells. Interestingly, we found the protein tyrosine phosphatase UBASH3B/Sts-1, which is known to inhibit CBL function, is upregulated by AML1-ETO through transcriptional and miR-9-mediated regulation. UBASH3B/Sts-1 depletion induces an aberrant pattern of CBL phosphorylation and impairs proliferation in AML1-ETO cells. The growth inhibition caused by UBASH3B/Sts-1 depletion can be rescued by ectopic expression of CBL mutants, suggesting that UBASH3B/Sts-1 supports the growth of AML1-ETO cells partly through modulation of CBL function. Our study reveals a role of CBL in restricting myeloid proliferation of human AML1-ETO-induced leukemia, and identifies UBASH3B/Sts-1 as a potential target for pharmaceutical intervention.

26476672|t|Wnt signaling in age-related macular degeneration: human macular tissue and mouse model.
26476672|a|BACKGROUND: The wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling is a group of signal transduction pathways. In canonical Wnt pathway, Wnt ligands bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5 or LRP6), resulting in phosphorylation and activation of the receptor. We hypothesize that canonical Wnt pathway plays a role in the retinal lesion of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of irreversible central visual loss in elderly. METHODS: We examined LRP6 phosphorylation and Wnt signaling cascade in human retinal sections and plasma kallistatin, an endogenous inhibitor of the Wnt pathway in AMD patients and non-AMD subjects. We also used the Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (-/-) /rd8 and Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (gfp/gfp) mouse models with AMD-like retinal degeneration to further explore the involvement of Wnt signaling activation in the retinal lesions in those models and to preclinically evaluate the role of Wnt signaling suppression as a potential therapeutic option for AMD. RESULTS: We found higher levels of LRP6 (a key Wnt signaling receptor) protein phosphorylation and transcripts of the Wnt pathway-targeted genes, as well as higher beta-catenin protein in AMD macula compared to controls. Kallistatin was decreased in the plasma of AMD patients. Retinal non-phosphorylated-b-catenin and phosphorylated-LRP6 were higher in Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (-/-) /rd8 mice than that in wild type. Intravitreal administration of an anti-LRP6 antibody slowed the progression of retinal lesions in Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (-/-) /rd8 and Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (gfp/gfp) mice. Electroretinography of treated eyes exhibited larger amplitudes compared to controls in both mouse models. A2E, a retinoid byproduct associated with AMD was lower in the treated eyes of Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (-/-) /rd8 mice. Anti-LRP6 also suppressed the expression of Tnf-a and Icam-1 in Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (-/-) /rd8 retinas. CONCLUSIONS: Wnt signaling may be disturbed in AMD patients, which could contribute to the retinal inflammation and increased A2E levels found in AMD. Aberrant activation of canonical Wnt signaling might also contribute to the focal retinal degenerative lesions of mouse models with Ccl2 and Cx3cr1 deficiency, and intravitreal administration of anti-LRP6 antibody could be beneficial by deactivating the canonical Wnt pathway.

26499944|t|HMGB1 promotes HCC progression partly by downregulating p21 via ERK/c-Myc pathway and upregulating MMP-2.
26499944|a|High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was found to be over-expressed in many kinds of human cancer, which binds with several receptors and activates RAGE-Ras-MAPK, Toll-like receptors, NF-kB, and Src family kinase signaling pathways and plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, the function and mechanism of HMGB1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HMGB1 on HCC progression and explore new molecular mechanism. HMGB1 transient knockdown, stable knockdown, and re-expression were performed by transfection with specific siRNA, shRNA, or expression vector in HCCLM3 cells. Results showed that transient knockdown HMGB1 prevented cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, induced S phase arrest, and inhibited migration and invasion in vitro, and stable knockdown HMGB1 inhibited xenograft growth in Balb/c athymic mice in vivo. Molecular mechanism investigation revealed that knockdown HMGB1 significantly reduced the activation of MAPKs, including ERK1/2, p38, SAPK/JNK, as well as MAPKKs (MEK1/2, SEK1) and its substrates (c-Jun, c-Myc); downregulated NF-kB/p65 expression and phosphorylation level; decreased MMP-2 expression and activity; and upregulated p21 expression. Interestingly, c-Myc was firstly found to be involved in the promoting function of HMGB1 on HCC progression, which provided a novel clue for the inhibitory effect of HMGB1 on p21 expression by a p53-independent pathway. Collectively, these findings indicated that HMGB1 promoted HCC progression partly by enhancing the ERK1/2 and NF-kB pathways, upregulating MMP-2, and downregulating p21 via an ERK/c-Myc pathway.

26620890|t|Role of MCP-1 on inflammatory processes and metabolic dysfunction following high-fat feedings in the FVB/N strain.
26620890|a|BACKGROUND: Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is known to be an important chemokine for macrophage recruitment. Thus, targeting MCP-1 may prevent the perturbations associated with macrophage-induced inflammation in adipose tissue. However, inconsistencies in the available animal literature have questioned the role of this chemokine in this process. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of MCP-1 on obesity-related pathologies. METHODS: Wild-type and MCP-1-deficient mice on an friend virus B NIH (FVB/N) background were assigned to either low-fat diet or high-fat diet (HFD) treatment for a period of 16 weeks. Body weight and body composition were measured weekly and monthly, respectively. Fasting blood glucose and insulin, and glucose tolerance were measured at 16 weeks. Macrophages, T-cell markers, inflammatory mediators and markers of fibrosis were examined in the adipose tissue at the time of killing the mice. RESULTS: As expected, HFD increased adiposity (body weight, fat mass, fat percent and adipocyte size), metabolic dysfunction (impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance) macrophage number (CD11b(+)F480(+) cells, and gene expression of EMR1 and CD11c), T-cell markers (gene expression of CD4 and CD8), inflammatory mediators (pNFkB and pJNK, and mRNA expression of MCP-1, CCL5, C-X-C motif chemokine-14, tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) and fibrosis (expression of IL-10, IL-13, TGF-b and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2); P<0.05). However, contrary to our hypothesis, MCP-1 deficiency exacerbated many of these responses resulting in a further increase in adiposity (body weight, fat mass, fat percent and adipocyte size), metabolic dysregulation, macrophage markers (EMR1), inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis (formation of type I and III collagens, mRNA expression of IL-10 and MMP2; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MCP-1 may be a necessary component of the inflammatory response required for adipose tissue protection, remodeling and healthy expansion in the FVB/N strain in response to HFD feedings.

26640231|t|Search for regulatory factors of the pituitary-specific transcription factor PROP1 gene.
26640231|a|Pituitary-specific transcription factor PROP1, a factor important for pituitary organogenesis, appears on rat embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) in SOX2-expressing stem/progenitor cells and always coexists with SOX2 throughout life. PROP1-positive cells at one point occupy all cells in Rathke's pouch, followed by a rapid decrease in their number. Their regulatory factors, except for RBP-J, have not yet been clarified. This study aimed to use the 3 kb upstream region and 1st intron of mouse prop1 to pinpoint a group of factors selected on the basis of expression in the early pituitary gland for expression of Prop1. Reporter assays for SOX2 and RBP-J showed that the stem/progenitor marker SOX2 has cell type-dependent inhibitory and activating functions through the proximal and distal upstream regions of Prop1, respectively, while RBP-J had small regulatory activity in some cell lines. Reporter assays for another 39 factors using the 3 kb upstream regions in CHO cells ultimately revealed that 8 factors, MSX2, PAX6, PIT1, PITX1, PITX2, RPF1, SOX8 and SOX11, but not RBP-J, regulate Prop1 expression. Furthermore, a synergy effect with SOX2 was observed for an additional 10 factors, FOXJ1, HES1, HEY1, HEY2, KLF6, MSX1, RUNX1, TEAD2, YBX2 and ZFP36Ll, which did not show substantial independent action. Thus, we demonstrated 19 candidates, including SOX2, to be regulatory factors of Prop1 expression.

26655640|t|Dioscin alleviates alcoholic liver fibrosis by attenuating hepatic stellate cell activation via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB signaling pathway.
26655640|a|The present work aimed to investigate the activities and underlying mechanisms of dioscin against alcoholic liver fibrosis (ALF). In vivo liver fibrosis in mice was induced by an alcoholic liquid diet, and in vitro studies were performed on activated HSC-T6 and LX2 cells treated with lipopolysaccharide. Our results showed that dioscin significantly attenuated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation, improved collagen accumulation, and attenuated inflammation through down-regulating the levels of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-a by decreasing Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 expression both in vivo and in vitro. TLR4 overexpression was also decreased by dioscin, leading to the markedly down-regulated levels of MyD88, NF-kB, transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1), a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and type I collagen (COL1A1) in cultured HSCs. Suppression of cellular MyD88 by ST2825 or abrogation of NF-kB by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate eliminated the inhibitory effects of dioscin on the levels of TGF-b1, a-SMA and COL1A1. In a word, dioscin exhibited potent effects against ALF via altering TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB signaling pathway, which provided novel insights into the mechanisms of this compound as an antifibrogenic candidate for the treatment of ALF in the future.

26847345|t|Transgelin increases metastatic potential of colorectal cancer cells in vivo and alters expression of genes involved in cell motility.
26847345|a|BACKGROUND: Transgelin is an actin-binding protein that promotes motility in normal cells. Although the role of transgelin in cancer is controversial, a number of studies have shown that elevated levels correlate with aggressive tumor behavior, advanced stage, and poor prognosis. Here we sought to determine the role of transgelin more directly by determining whether experimental manipulation of transgelin levels in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells led to changes in metastatic potential in vivo. METHODS: Isogenic CRC cell lines that differ in transgelin expression were characterized using in vitro assays of growth and invasiveness and a mouse tail vein assay of experimental metastasis. Downstream effects of transgelin overexpression were investigated by gene expression profiling and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Stable overexpression of transgelin in RKO cells, which have low endogenous levels, led to increased invasiveness, growth at low density, and growth in soft agar. Overexpression also led to an increase in the number and size of lung metastases in the mouse tail vein injection model. Similarly, attenuation of transgelin expression in HCT116 cells, which have high endogenous levels, decreased metastases in the same model. Investigation of mRNA expression patterns showed that transgelin overexpression altered the levels of approximately 250 other transcripts, with over-representation of genes that affect function of actin or other cytoskeletal proteins. Changes included increases in HOOK1, SDCCAG8, ENAH/Mena, and TNS1 and decreases in EMB, BCL11B, and PTPRD. CONCLUSIONS: Increases or decreases in transgelin levels have reciprocal effects on tumor cell behavior, with higher expression promoting metastasis. Chronic overexpression influences steady-state levels of mRNAs for metastasis-related genes.

27014915|t|NF-kB functions as a molecular link between tumor cells and Th1/Tc1 T cells in the tumor microenvironment to exert radiation-mediated tumor suppression.
27014915|a|Radiation modulates both tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment to exert its anti-tumor activity; however, the molecular connection between tumor cells and immune cells that mediates radiation-exerted tumor suppression activity in the tumor microenvironment is largely unknown. We report here that radiation induces rapid activation of the p65/p50 and p50/p50 NF-kB complexes in human soft tissue sarcoma (STS) cells. Radiation-activated p65/p50 and p50/p50 bind to the TNFa promoter to activate its transcription in STS cells. Radiation-induced TNFa induces tumor cell death in an autocrine manner. A sublethal dose of Smac mimetic BV6 induces cIAP1 and cIAP2 degradation to increase tumor cell sensitivity to radiation-induced cell death in vitro and to enhance radiation-mediated suppression of STS xenografts in vivo. Inhibition of caspases, RIP1, or RIP3 blocks radiation/TNFa-induced cell death, whereas inhibition of RIP1 blocks TNFa-induced caspase activation, suggesting that caspases and RIP1 act sequentially to mediate the non-compensatory cell death pathways. Furthermore, we determined in a syngeneic sarcoma mouse model that radiation up-regulates IRF3, IFNb, and the T cell chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 in the tumor microenvironment, which are associated with activation and increased infiltration of Th1/Tc1 T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, tumor-infiltrating T cells are in their active form since both the perforin and FasL pathways are activated in irradiated tumor tissues. Consequently, combined BV6 and radiation completely suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, radiation-induced NF-kB functions as a molecular link between tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment for radiation-mediated tumor suppression.

27084744|t|NOTCH1 and SOX10 are Essential for Proliferation and Radiation Resistance of Cancer Stem-Like Cells in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma.
27084744|a|PURPOSE: Although the existence of cancer stem cells (CSC) in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) has been proposed, lack of assays for their propagation and uncertainty about molecular markers prevented their characterization. Our objective was to isolate CSC from ACC and provide insight into signaling pathways that support their propagation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To isolate CSC from ACC and characterize them, we used ROCK inhibitor-supplemented cell culture, immunomagnetic cell sorting, andin vitro/in vivoassays for CSC viability and tumorigenicity. RESULTS: We identified in ACC CD133-positive CSC that expressed NOTCH1 and SOX10, formed spheroids, and initiated tumors in nude mice. CD133(+)ACC cells produced activated NOTCH1 (N1ICD) and generated CD133(-)cells that expressed JAG1 as well as neural differentiation factors NR2F1, NR2F2, and p27Kip1. Knockdowns ofNOTCH1, SOX10, and their common effectorFABP7had negative effects on each other, inhibited spheroidogenesis, and induced cell death pointing at their essential roles in CSC maintenance. Downstream effects ofFABP7knockdown included suppression of a broad spectrum of genes involved in proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolism. Among proliferation-linked NOTCH1/FABP7 targets, we identified SKP2 and its substrate p27Kip1. A g-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, selectively depleted CD133(+)cells, suppressed N1ICD and SKP2, induced p27Kip1, inhibited ACC growthin vivo, and sensitized CD133(+)cells to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: These results establish in the majority of ACC the presence of a previously uncharacterized population of CD133(+)cells with neural stem properties, which are driven by SOX10, NOTCH1, and FABP7. Sensitivity of these cells to Notch inhibition and their dependence on SKP2 offer new opportunities for targeted ACC therapies.

27102965|t|Artery Tertiary Lymphoid Organs Control Multilayered Territorialized Atherosclerosis B-Cell Responses in Aged ApoE-/- Mice.
27102965|a|OBJECTIVE: Explore aorta B-cell immunity in aged apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Transcript maps, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, immunofluorescence analyses, cell transfers, and Ig-ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunospot) assays showed multilayered atherosclerosis B-cell responses in artery tertiary lymphoid organs (ATLOs). Aging-associated aorta B-cell-related transcriptomes were identified, and transcript atlases revealed highly territorialized B-cell responses in ATLOs versus atherosclerotic lesions: ATLOs showed upregulation of bona fide B-cell genes, including Cd19, Ms4a1 (Cd20), Cd79a/b, and Ighm although intima plaques preferentially expressed molecules involved in non-B effector responses toward B-cell-derived mediators, that is, Fcgr3 (Cd16), Fcer1g (Cd23), and the C1q family. ATLOs promoted B-cell recruitment. ATLO B-2 B cells included naive, transitional, follicular, germinal center, switched IgG1(+), IgA(+), and IgE(+) memory cells, plasmablasts, and long-lived plasma cells. ATLOs recruited large numbers of B-1 cells whose subtypes were skewed toward interleukin-10(+) B-1b cells versus interleukin-10(-) B-1a cells. ATLO B-1 cells and plasma cells constitutively produced IgM and IgG and a fraction of plasma cells expressed interleukin-10. Moreover, ApoE(-/-) mice showed increased germinal center B cells in renal lymph nodes, IgM-producing plasma cells in the bone marrow, and higher IgM and anti-MDA-LDL (malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein) IgG serum titers. CONCLUSIONS: ATLOs orchestrate dichotomic, territorialized, and multilayered B-cell responses in the diseased aorta; germinal center reactions indicate generation of autoimmune B cells within the diseased arterial wall during aging.

27177927|t|Calreticulin-mutant proteins induce megakaryocytic signaling to transform hematopoietic cells and undergo accelerated degradation and Golgi-mediated secretion.
27177927|a|BACKGROUND: Somatic calreticulin (CALR), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) mutations essentially show mutual exclusion in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), suggesting that they activate common oncogenic pathways. Recent data have shown that MPL function is essential for CALR mutant-driven MPN. However, the exact role and the mechanisms of action of CALR mutants have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: The murine myeloid cell line 32D and human HL60 cells overexpressing the most frequent CALR type 1 and type 2 frameshift mutants were generated to analyze the first steps of cellular transformation, in the presence and absence of MPL expression. Furthermore, mutant CALR protein stability and secretion were examined using brefeldin A, MG132, spautin-1, and tunicamycin treatment. RESULTS: The present study demonstrates that the expression of endogenous Mpl, CD41, and the key megakaryocytic transcription factor NF-E2 is stimulated by type 1 and type 2 CALR mutants, even in the absence of exogenous MPL. Mutant CALR expressing 32D cells spontaneously acquired cytokine independence, and this was associated with increased Mpl mRNA expression, CD41, and NF-E2 protein as well as constitutive activation of downstream signaling and response to JAK inhibitor treatment. Exogenous expression of MPL led to constitutive activation of STAT3 and 5, ERK1/2, and AKT, cytokine-independent growth, and reduction of apoptosis similar to the effects seen in the spontaneously outgrown cells. We observed low CALR-mutant protein amounts in cellular lysates of stably transduced cells, and this was due to accelerated protein degradation that occurred independently from the ubiquitin-proteasome system as well as autophagy. CALR-mutant degradation was attenuated by MPL expression. Interestingly, we found high levels of mutated CALR and loss of downstream signaling after blockage of the secretory pathway and protein glycosylation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potency of CALR mutants to drive expression of megakaryocytic differentiation markers such as NF-E2 and CD41 as well as Mpl. Furthermore, CALR mutants undergo accelerated protein degradation that involves the secretory pathway and/or protein glycosylation.

27220763|t|Prognostic factors in the myoepithelial-like spindle cell type of metaplastic breast cancer.
27220763|a|Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) comprises a heterogeneous group of tumors with difficult to predict biological behavior. A subset of MBC, characterized by spindle-shaped tumor cells with a myoepithelial-like immunophenotype, was entered into a retrospective study (n = 42, median follow-up time 43 months). Molecular parameters (DNA sequences of mutation hot spots in AKT1, ALK, APC, BRAF, CDH1, CTNNB1, EGFR, ERBB2, FBXW7, FGFR2, FOXL2, GNAQ, GNAS, KIT, KRAS, MAP2K1, MET, MSH6, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTEN, SF3B1, SMAD4, SRC, SRSF2, STK11, TP53, and U2AF1; copy numbers for EGFR, c-myc, FGFR, PLAG, c-met) were assessed. None of the patients had axillary lymph node involvement. In 13 cases, local recurrence developed after surgery (30.9 %). Distant metastasis occurred in seven patients (17 %; four after local recurrence). The most frequent genetic alteration was PIK3CA mutation (50 % of cases). None of the pathological parameters (size, grade, stage, Ki-67 labeling index) was significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS). PIK3CA mutation, especially the H1047R type, tended to adversely affect OS. Type of resection (mastectomy vs. breast-conserving therapy, width of margins) or adjuvant radiotherapy had no influence on DFS or OS, whereas in the group treated with radio-/chemotherapy, no local recurrence or metastasis and no death occurred. We conclude that the spindle cell type of MBC with myoepithelial features exhibits a higher frequency of PIK3CA mutation than other types of metaplastic or basal-like breast cancer and may benefit from combined radio-/chemotherapy. Classical pathological parameters are not helpful in identifying the high-risk tumors among this subgroup of MBC.

27274086|t|E2F and GATA switches turn off WD repeat domain 77 expression in differentiating cells.
27274086|a|WDR77 (WD repeat domain 77) is expressed during earlier lung development when cells are rapidly proliferating, but is absent from adult lung. It is re-activated during lung tumorigenesis and is essential for lung cancer cell proliferation. Signalling pathways/molecules that control WDR77 gene expression are unknown. Promoter mapping, gel shift assay and ChIP revealed that the WDR77 promoter contains bona fide response elements for E2F and GATA transcriptional factors as demonstrated in prostate cancer, lung cancer and erythroid cells, as well as in mouse lung tissues. The WDR77 promoter is transactivated by E2F1, E2F3, GATA1 and GATA6, but suppressed by E2F6, GATA1 and GATA3 in prostate cancer PC3 cells. WDR77 expression is associated with E2F1, E2F3, GATA2 and GATA6 occupancy on the WDR77 gene, whereas, in contrast, E2F6, GATA1 and GATA3 occupancy is associated with the loss of WDR77 expression during erythroid maturation and lung development. More importantly, the loss of WDR77 expression that results from E2F and GATA switches is required for cellular differentiation of erythroid and lung epithelial cells. In contrast, lung cancer cells avoid post-mitotic differentiation by sustaining WDR77 expression. Altogether, the present study provides a novel molecular mechanism by which WDR77 is regulated during erythroid and lung development and lung tumorigenesis.

27385779|t|A Critical Role for CD200R Signaling in Limiting the Growth and Metastasis of CD200+ Melanoma.
27385779|a|CD200 is a cell surface glycoprotein that functions through engaging CD200R on cells of the myeloid lineage and inhibits their functions. Expression of CD200 was implicated in a variety of human cancer cells, including melanoma cells; however, its roles in tumor growth and immunity are not clearly understood. In this study, we used CD200R-deficient mice and the B16 tumor model to evaluate this issue. We found that CD200R-deficient mice exhibited accelerated growth of CD200(+), but not CD200(-), B16 tumors. Strikingly, CD200R-deficient mice receiving CD200(+) B16 cells i.v. exhibited massive tumor growth in multiple organs, including liver, lung, kidney, and peritoneal cavity, whereas the growth of the same tumors in wild-type mice was limited. CD200(+) tumors grown in CD200R-deficient mice contained higher numbers of CD11b(+)Ly6C(+) myeloid cells, exhibited increased expression of VEGF and HIF1a genes with increased angiogenesis, and showed significantly reduced infiltration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, presumably as the result of reduced expression of T cell chemokines, such as CXCL9 and CXCL16. The liver from CD200R-deficient mice, under metastatic growth of CD200(+) tumors, contained significantly increased numbers of CD11b(+)Gr1(-) myeloid cells and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells and reduced numbers of NK cells. Liver T cells also had a reduced capacity to produce IFN-g or TNF-a. Taken together, we revealed a critical role for CD200R signaling in limiting the growth and metastasis of CD200(+) tumors. Thus, targeting CD200R signaling may potentially interfere with the metastatic growth of CD200(+) tumors, like melanoma.

27391260|t|Adrenomedullin promotes the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma through recruitment of myelomonocytic cells.
27391260|a|Stromal infiltration of myelomonocytic cells is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and is related to a poor prognosis. However, the detailed mechanism for the recruitment of myelomonocytic cells to pancreatic cancer tissue remains unclear. In the present study, pancreatic cancer cells secreted high levels of adrenomedullin (ADM), and CD11b+ myelomonocytic cells expressed all components of ADM receptors, including GPR182, CRLR, RAMP2 and RAMP3. ADM enhanced the migration and invasion of myelomonocytic cells through activation of the MAPK, PI3K/Akt and eNOS signaling pathways, as well as the expression and activity of MMP-2. ADM also promoted the adhesion and trans-endothelial migration of myelomonocytic cells by increasing expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. In addition, ADM induced macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to express pro-tumor phenotypes. ADM knockdown in tumor-bearing mice or administration of AMA, an ADM antagonist, significantly inhibited the recruitment of myelomonocytic cells and tumor angiogenesis. Moreover, in vivo depletion of myelomonocytic cells using clodronate liposomes suppressed the progression of PDAC. These results reveal a novel function of ADM in PDAC, and suggest ADM is a promising target in the treatment of PDAC.

27626488|t|TGF-b1 promotes colorectal cancer immune escape by elevating B7-H3 and B7-H4 via the miR-155/miR-143 axis.
27626488|a|Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b1) suppresses T cell function, promoting tumor immune escape. Yet, whether the depression of TGF-b1 on T cell function is mediated by co-inhibitory molecules B7-H3 and B7-H4 remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that TGF-b1 elevated the expression of miR-155 in colorectal cancer cells through SMAD3 and SMAD4. The upregulated miR-155 attenuated miR-143 by inhibiting its direct target, the transcription factor CEBPB. Consequently, the direct target genes of miR-143, B7-H3 and B7-H4, were augmented in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells. Over-expression of B7-H3 and B7-H4 in HCT-116 cells induced T cells to secrete TGF-b1 and the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-2, IL-6, and IL-17. Restoration of miR-143 inhibited the growth of HCT-116 xenograft tumors in mice, and also repressed the expression of B7-H3 and B7-H4 in the tumors. Thus, this study reveals the mechanism by which TGF-b1 leads to T cell-mediated tumor evasion through an increase in B7-H3 and B7-H4 expression.

27689325|t|Catalytically defective receptor protein tyrosine kinase PTK7 enhances invasive phenotype by inducing MMP-9 through activation of AP-1 and NF-kB in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells.
27689325|a|Protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), a member of the catalytically defective receptor protein tyrosine kinase family, is upregulated in various cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Here, we have explored the molecular mechanism of PTK7-dependent invasiveness in ESCC cells. PTK7 knockdown reduced gelatin degradation and MMP-9 secretion in cultures of ESCC TE-10 cells, and showed reduced levels of MMP9 mRNA using real-time RT-PCR and luciferase reporter assays. PTK7 knockdown decreased not only phosphorylation of NF-kB, IkB, ERK, and JNK, but also nuclear localization of NF-kB and AP-1 consisting of c-Fos and c-Jun. Activation of AP-1 and NF-kB requires PTK7-mediated activation of tyrosine kinases, including Src. In addition, NF-kB activation by PTK7 involves the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. PTK7-mediated upregulation of MMP9 was also observed in other ESCC cell lines and in three-dimensional cultures of TE-10 cells. Moreover, MMP-9 expression positively correlated with PTK7 expression in ESCC tumor tissue. These findings demonstrate that PTK7 upregulates MMP9 through activation of AP-1 and NF-kB and, thus increases invasive properties of ESCC cells.

28036337|t|Sertoli Cell Wt1 Regulates Peritubular Myoid Cell and Fetal Leydig Cell Differentiation during Fetal Testis Development.
28036337|a|Sertoli cells play a significant role in regulating fetal testis compartmentalization to generate testis cords and interstitium during development. The Sertoli cell Wilms' tumor 1 (Wt1) gene, which encodes ~24 zinc finger-containing transcription factors, is known to play a crucial role in fetal testis cord assembly and maintenance. However, whether Wt1 regulates fetal testis compartmentalization by modulating the development of peritubular myoid cells (PMCs) and/or fetal Leydig cells (FLCs) remains unknown. Using a Wt1-/flox; Amh-Cre mouse model by deleting Wt1 in Sertoli cells (Wt1SC-cKO) at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), Wt1 was found to regulate PMC and FLC development. Wt1 deletion in fetal testis Sertoli cells caused aberrant differentiation and proliferation of PMCs, FLCs and interstitial progenitor cells from embryo to newborn, leading to abnormal fetal testis interstitial development. Specifically, the expression of PMC marker genes a-Sma, Myh11 and Des, and interstitial progenitor cell marker gene Vcam1 were down-regulated, whereas FLC marker genes StAR, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1 and Hsd3b1 were up-regulated, in neonatal Wt1SC-cKO testes. The ratio of PMC:FLC were also reduced in Wt1SC-cKO testes, concomitant with a down-regulation of Notch signaling molecules Jag 1, Notch 2, Notch 3, and Hes1 in neonatal Wt1SC-cKO testes, illustrating changes in the differentiation status of FLC from their interstitial progenitor cells during fetal testis development. In summary, Wt1 regulates the development of FLC and interstitial progenitor cell lineages through Notch signaling, and it also plays a role in PMC development. Collectively, these effects confer fetal testis compartmentalization.

28084316|t|TNFa drives pulmonary arterial hypertension by suppressing the BMP type-II receptor and altering NOTCH signalling.
28084316|a|Heterozygous germ-line mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein type-II receptor (BMPR-II) gene underlie heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (HPAH). Although inflammation promotes PAH, the mechanisms by which inflammation and BMPR-II dysfunction conspire to cause disease remain unknown. Here we identify that tumour necrosis factor-a (TNFa) selectively reduces BMPR-II transcription and mediates post-translational BMPR-II cleavage via the sheddases, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). TNFa-mediated suppression of BMPR-II subverts BMP signalling, leading to BMP6-mediated PASMC proliferation via preferential activation of an ALK2/ACTR-IIA signalling axis. Furthermore, TNFa, via SRC family kinases, increases pro-proliferative NOTCH2 signalling in HPAH PASMCs with reduced BMPR-II expression. We confirm this signalling switch in rodent models of PAH and demonstrate that anti-TNFa immunotherapy reverses disease progression, restoring normal BMP/NOTCH signalling. Collectively, these findings identify mechanisms by which BMP and TNFa signalling contribute to disease, and suggest a tractable approach for therapeutic intervention in PAH.

28087598|t|Bayesian network inference modeling identifies TRIB1 as a novel regulator of cell cycle progression and survival in cancer cells.
28087598|a|Molecular networks governing cellular responses to targeted therapies are complex dynamic systems with non-intuitive behaviors. Here we applied a novel computational strategy to infer probabilistic causal relationships between network components based on gene expression. We constructed a model comprised of an ensemble of networks using multidimensional data from cell line models of cell cycle arrest caused by inhibition of MEK1/2. Through simulation of reverse-engineered Bayesian network modeling, we generated predictions of G1-S transition. The model identified known components of the cell cycle machinery, such as CCND1, CCNE2 and CDC25A, as well as novel regulators of G1-S transition IER2, TRIB1 and TRIM27. Experimental validation of this model confirmed 10 of 12 predicted genes to have a role in progression through the G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle. Further analysis showed that TRIB1 regulated the cyclin D1 promoter via NF-kB and AP-1 sites and sensitized cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In clinical specimens of breast cancer, TRIB1 levels correlated with expression of NF-kB and its target genes IL-8 and CSF2, and TRIB1 copy number and expression were predictive of clinical outcome. Together, our results establish a critical role for TRIB1 in cell cycle and survival that is mediated via the modulation of NF-kB signaling.

28186140|t|Activated niacin receptor HCA2 inhibits chemoattractant-mediated macrophage migration via Gbg/PKC/ERK1/2 pathway and heterologous receptor desensitization.
28186140|a|The niacin receptor HCA2 is implicated in controlling inflammatory host responses with yet poorly understood mechanistic basis. We previously reported that HCA2 in A431 epithelial cells transduced Gbg-protein kinase C- and Gbg-metalloproteinase/EGFR-dependent MAPK/ERK signaling cascades. Here, we investigated the role of HCA2 in macrophage-mediated inflammation and the underlying mechanisms. We found that proinflammatory stimulants LPS, IL-6 and IL-1b up-regulated the expression of HCA2 on macrophages. Niacin significantly inhibited macrophage chemotaxis in response to chemoattractants fMLF and CCL2 by disrupting polarized distribution of F-actin and Gb protein. Niacin showed a selected additive effect on chemoattractant-induced activation of ERK1/2, JNK and PI3K pathways, but only the MEK inhibitor UO126 reduced niacin-mediated inhibition of macrophage chemotaxis, while activation of ERK1/2 by EGF alone did not inhibit fMLF-mediated migration of HEK293T cells co-expressing HCA2 and fMLF receptor FPR1. In addition, niacin induced heterologous desensitization and internalization of FPR1. Furthermore, niacin rescued mice from septic shock by diminishing inflammatory symptoms and the effect was abrogated in HCA2(-/-) mice. These results suggest that Gbg/PKC-dependent ERK1/2 activation and heterologous desensitization of chemoattractant receptors are involved in the inhibition of chemoattractant-induced migration of macrophages by niacin. Thus, HCA2 plays a critical role in host protection against pro-inflammatory insults.

28224733|t|NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) T cells suppress DSS-induced colitis in mice through production of TGF-b.
28224733|a|CD4(+) NKG2D(+) T cells are associated with tumour, infection and autoimmune diseases. Some CD4(+) NKG2D(+) T cells secrete IFN-g and TNF-a to promote inflammation, but others produce TGF-b and FasL to facilitate tumour evasion. Here, murine CD4(+) NKG2D(+) T cells were further classified into NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) and NK1.1(+) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) subpopulations. The frequency of NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells decreased in inflamed colons, whereas more NK1.1(+) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells infiltrated into colons of mice with DSS-induced colitis. NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells expressed TGF-b and FasL without secreting IFN-g, IL-21 and IL-17 and displayed no cytotoxicity. The adoptive transfer of NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells suppressed DSS-induced colitis largely dependent on TGF-b. NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells did not expressed Foxp3, CD223 (LAG-3) and GITR. The subpopulation was distinct from NK1.1(+) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells in terms of surface markers and RNA transcription. NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells also differed from Th2 or Th17 cells because the former did not express GATA-3 and ROR-gt. Thus, NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells exhibited immune regulatory functions, and this T cell subset could be developed to suppress inflammation in clinics.

28296029|t|CD38 promotes angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
28296029|a|Cardiac hypertrophy is an early hallmark during the clinical course of heart failure and regulated by various signalling pathways. Recently, we observed that mouse embryonic fibroblasts from CD38 knockout mice were significantly resistant to oxidative stress such as H2 O2 -induced injury and hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced injury. In addition, we also found that CD38 knockout mice protected heart from ischaemia reperfusion injury through activating SIRT1/FOXOs-mediated antioxidative stress pathway. However, the role of CD38 in cardiac hypertrophy is not explored. Here, we investigated the roles and mechanisms of CD38 in angiotensin II (Ang-II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Following 14 days of Ang-II infusion with osmotic mini-pumps, a comparable hypertension was generated in both of CD38 knockout and wild-type mice. However, the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were much more severe in wild-type mice compared with CD38 knockout mice. Consistently, RNAi-induced knockdown of CD38 decreased the gene expressions of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and reactive oxygen species generation in Ang-II-stimulated H9c2 cells. In addition, the expression of SIRT3 was elevated in CD38 knockdown H9c2 cells, in which SIRT3 may further activate the FOXO3 antioxidant pathway. The intracellular Ca(2+) release induced by Ang-II markedly decreased in CD38 knockdown H9c2 cells, which might be associated with the decrease of nuclear translocation of NFATc4 and inhibition of ERK/AKT phosphorylation. We concluded that CD38 plays an essential role in cardiac hypertrophy probably via inhibition of SIRT3 expression and activation of Ca(2+) -NFAT signalling pathway. Thus, CD38 may be a novel target for treating cardiac hypertrophy.

28395336|t|Dose-dependent functions of fibroblast growth factor 9 regulate the fate of murine XY primordial germ cells.
28395336|a|Male differentiation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) is initiated by the inhibition of entry into meiosis and exposure to male-inducing factor(s), which are regulated by somatic elements of the developing gonad. Fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) produced by pre-Sertoli cells is essential for male gonadal differentiation and also contributes to survival and male differentiation of XY PGCs. However, it is not clear how FGF9 regulates PGC fate. Using a PGC culture system, we identified dose-dependent, fate-determining functions of FGF9 in XY PGCs. Treatment with low levels of FGF9 (0.2 ng/ml) increased expression of male-specific Dnmt3L and Nanos2 in XY PGCs. Conversely, treatment with high levels of FGF9 (25 ng/ml) suppressed male-specific gene expression and stimulated proliferation of XY PGCs. Western blotting showed that low FGF9 treatment enhanced p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) phosphorylation in the same cells. In contrast, high FGF9 treatment significantly stimulated the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)1/2 signaling pathway in XY PGCs. We investigated the relationship between the ERK1/2 signaling pathway stimulated by high FGF9 and regulation of PGC proliferation. An ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) suppressed the PGC proliferation that would otherwise be stimulated by high FGF9 treatment, and increased Nanos2 expression in XY PGCs. Conversely, a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB202190) significantly suppressed Nanos2 expression that would otherwise be stimulated by low FGF9 in XY PGCs. Taken together, our results suggest that stage-specific expression of FGF9 in XY gonads regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation of XY PGCs in a dose-dependent manner.

28747658|t|A single amino acid substitution confers B-cell clonogenic activity to the HIV-1 matrix protein p17.
28747658|a|Recent data highlight the presence, in HIV-1-seropositive patients with lymphoma, of p17 variants (vp17s) endowed with B-cell clonogenicity, suggesting a role of vp17s in lymphomagenesis. We investigated the mechanisms responsible for the functional disparity on B cells between a wild-type p17 (refp17) and a vp17 named S75X. Here, we show that a single Arginine (R) to Glycine (G) mutation at position 76 in the refp17 backbone (p17R76G), as in the S75X variant, is per se sufficient to confer a B-cell clonogenic potential to the viral protein and modulate, through activation of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, different molecules involved in apoptosis inhibition (CASP-9, CASP-7, DFF-45, NPM, YWHAZ, Src, PAX2, MAPK8), cell cycle promotion and cancer progression (CDK1, CDK2, CDK8, CHEK1, CHEK2, GSK-3 beta, NPM, PAK1, PP2C-alpha). Moreover, the only R to G mutation at position 76 was found to strongly impact on protein folding and oligomerization by altering the hydrogen bond network. This generates a conformational shift in the p17 R76G mutant which enables a functional epitope(s), masked in refp17, to elicit B-cell growth-promoting signals after its interaction with a still unknown receptor(s). Our findings offer new opportunities to understand the molecular mechanisms accounting for the B-cell growth-promoting activity of vp17s.

28759611|t|TPL-2 restricts Ccl24-dependent immunity to Heligmosomoides polygyrus.
28759611|a|TPL-2 (COT, MAP3K8) kinase activates the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway in innate immune responses following TLR, TNFR1 and IL-1R stimulation. TPL-2 contributes to type-1/Th17-mediated autoimmunity and control of intracellular pathogens. We recently demonstrated TPL-2 reduces severe airway allergy to house dust mite by negatively regulating type-2 responses. In the present study, we found that TPL-2 deficiency resulted in resistance to Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection, with accelerated worm expulsion, reduced fecal egg burden and reduced worm fitness. Using co-housing experiments, we found resistance to infection in TPL-2 deficient mice (Map3k8-/-) was independent of microbiota alterations in H. polygyrus infected WT and Map3k8-/-mice. Additionally, our data demonstrated immunity to H. polygyrus infection in TPL-2 deficient mice was not due to dysregulated type-2 immune responses. Genome-wide analysis of intestinal tissue from infected TPL-2-deficient mice identified elevated expression of genes involved in chemotaxis and homing of leukocytes and cells, including Ccl24 and alternatively activated genes. Indeed, Map3k8-/-mice had a significant influx of eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes and Il4GFP+ T cells. Conditional knockout experiments demonstrated that specific deletion of TPL-2 in CD11c+ cells, but not Villin+ epithelial cells, LysM+ myeloid cells or CD4+ T cells, led to accelerated resistance to H. polygyrus. In line with a central role of CD11c+ cells, CD11c+ CD11b+ cells isolated from TPL-2-deficient mice had elevated Ccl24. Finally, Ccl24 neutralization in TPL-2 deficient mice significantly decreased the expression of Arg1, Retnla, Chil3 and Ear11 correlating with a loss of resistance to H. polygyrus. These observations suggest that TPL-2-regulated Ccl24 in CD11c+CD11b+ cells prevents accelerated type-2 mediated immunity to H. polygyrus.

28855439|t|Intrauterine growth retardation promotes fetal intestinal autophagy in rats via the mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway.
28855439|a|Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) impairs fetal intestinal development, and is associated with high perinatal morbidity and mortality. However, the mechanism underlying this intestinal injury is largely unknown. We aimed to investigate this mechanism through analysis of intestinal autophagy and related signaling pathways in a rat model of IUGR. Normal weight (NW) and IUGR fetuses were obtained from primiparous rats via ad libitum food intake and 50% food restriction, respectively. Maternal serum parameters, fetal body weight, organ weights, and fetal blood glucose were determined. Intestinal apoptosis, autophagy, and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway were analyzed. The results indicated that maternal 50% food restriction reduced maternal serum glucose, bilirubin, and total cholesterol and produced IUGR fetuses, which had decreased body weight; blood glucose; and weights of the small intestine, stomach, spleen, pancreas, and kidney. Decreased Bcl-2 and increased Casp9 mRNA expression was observed in IUGR fetal intestines. Analysis of intestinal autophagy showed that the mRNA expression of WIPI1, MAP1LC3B, Atg5, and Atg14 was also increased, while the protein levels of p62 were decreased in IUGR fetuses. Compared to NW fetuses, IUGR fetuses showed decreased mTOR protein levels and enhanced mRNA expression of ULK1 and Beclin1 in the small intestine. In summary, the results indicated that maternal 50% food restriction on gestational days 10-21 reduced maternal serum glucose, bilirubin, and total cholesterol contents, and produced IUGR fetuses that had low blood glucose and reduced small intestine weight. Intestinal injury of IUGR fetuses caused by maternal food restriction might be due to enhanced apoptosis and autophagy via the mTOR signaling pathway.

29054964|t|Gene expression profiling of the Notch-AhR-IL22 axis at homeostasis and in response to tissue injury.
29054964|a|Notch and Interleukin-22 signaling are known to regulate tissue homeostasis and response to injury in humans and mice, and the induction of endogenous arylhydrocarbon receptor ligands through Notch links the two pathways in a hierarchical fashion. However, in adults the species-, organ- and injury-specific gene expression of the Notch-AhR-IL22 axis components is unknown. We therefore performed gene expression profiling of DLL1, DLL3, DLL4, DLK1, DLK2, JAG1, JAG2, Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Notch4, ADAM17/TACE, PSEN1, BSG/CD147, RBP-J, HES1, HES5, HEY1, HEYL, AHR, ARNT, ARNT2, CYP1A1, CYP24A1, IL22, IL22RA1, IL22RA2, IL10RB, and STAT3 under homeostatic conditions in 10 mature murine and human organs. Additionally, the expression of these genes was assessed in murine models of acute sterile inflammation and progressive fibrosis. We show that there are organ specific gene expression profiles of the Notch-AhR-IL22 axis in humans and mice. Although there is an overall interspecies congruency, specific differences between human and murine expression signatures do exist. In murine tissues with AHR/ARNT expression CYP1A1 and IL22 were correlated with HES5 and HEYL expression, while in human tissues no such correlation was found. Notch- and AhR-signaling are involved in renal inflammation and fibrosis with specific gene expression changes in each model. Despite the presence of all Notch pathway molecules in the kidney and a model-specific induction of Notch ligands, IL22 was only upregulated in acute inflammation, but rapidly downregulated during regeneration. This implies that for targeting injury responses e.g. via Interleukin-22, species-specific differences, injury-type and timepoints have to be considered.

29470556|t|No evidence for association between APOL1 kidney disease risk alleles and Human African Trypanosomiasis in two Ugandan populations.
29470556|a|BACKGROUND: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) manifests as an acute form caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr) and a chronic form caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (Tbg). Previous studies have suggested a host genetic role in infection outcomes, particularly for APOL1. We have undertaken candidate gene association studies (CGAS) in a Ugandan Tbr and a Tbg HAT endemic area, to determine whether polymorphisms in IL10, IL8, IL4, HLAG, TNFA, TNX4LB, IL6, IFNG, MIF, APOL1, HLAA, IL1B, IL4R, IL12B, IL12R, HP, HPR, and CFH have a role in HAT. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: We included 238 and 202 participants from the Busoga Tbr and Northwest Uganda Tbg endemic areas respectively. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotype data were analysed in the CGAS. The study was powered to find odds ratios > 2 but association testing of the SNPs with HAT yielded no positive associations i.e. none significant after correction for multiple testing. However there was strong evidence for no association with Tbr HAT and APOL1 G2 of the size previously reported in the Kabermaido district of Uganda. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A recent study in the Soroti and Kaberamaido focus in Central Uganda found that the APOL1 G2 allele was strongly associated with protection against Tbr HAT (odds ratio = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.48, p = 0.0001). However, in our study no effect of G2 on Tbr HAT was found, despite being well powered to find a similar sized effect (OR = 0.9281, 95% CI: 0.482 to 1.788, p = 0.8035). It is possible that the G2 allele is protective from Tbr in the Soroti/Kabermaido focus but not in the Iganga district of Busoga, which differ in ethnicity and infection history. Mechanisms underlying HAT infection outcome and virulence are complex and might differ between populations, and likely involve several host, parasite or even environmental factors.

29956586|t|Nonmuscle myosin II isoforms interact with sodium channel alpha subunits.
29956586|a|Sodium channels play pivotal roles in health and diseases due to their ability to control cellular excitability. The pore-forming alpha-subunits (sodium channel alpha subunits) of the voltage-sensitive channels (i.e., Nav1.1-1.9) and the nonvoltage-dependent channel (i.e., Nax) share a common structural motif and selectivity for sodium ions. We hypothesized that the actin-based nonmuscle myosin II motor proteins, nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-IIA/myh9, and nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-IIB/myh10 might interact with sodium channel alpha subunits to play an important role in their transport, trafficking, and/or function. Immunochemical and electrophysiological assays were conducted using rodent nervous (brain and dorsal root ganglia) tissues and ND7/23 cells coexpressing Nav subunits and recombinant myosins. Immunoprecipitation of myh9 and myh10 from rodent brain tissues led to the coimmunoprecipitation of Nax, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 subunits, but not Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 subunits, expressed there. Similarly, immunoprecipitation of myh9 and myh10 from rodent dorsal root ganglia tissues led to the coimmunoprecipitation of Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 subunits, but not Nav1.9 subunits, expressed there. The functional implication of one of these interactions was assessed by coexpressing myh10 along with Nav1.8 subunits in ND7/23 cells. Myh10 overexpression led to three-fold increase ( P < 0.01) in the current density of Nav1.8 channels expressed in ND7/23 cells. Myh10 coexpression also hyperpolarized voltage-dependent activation and steady-state fast inactivation of Nav1.8 channels. In addition, coexpression of myh10 reduced ( P < 0.01) the offset of fast inactivation and the amplitude of the ramp currents of Nav1.8 channels. These results indicate that nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-IIs interact with sodium channel alpha subunits subunits in an isoform-dependent manner and influence their functional properties.

30001398|t|Downregulation of splicing regulator RBFOX1 compromises visual depth perception.
30001398|a|Rbfox1 is a splicing regulator that has been associated with various neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, mental retardation, epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia. We show that in adult rodent retinas, Rbfox1 is expressed in all types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and in certain subsets of amacrine cells (ACs), within the inner nuclear (INL) and ganglion cell (GCL) layers. In the INL, all Rbfox1-positive cells were colocalized with GABAergic ACs, however not all GABAergic ACs were immunostained for Rbfox1. In the GCL, a vast majority of GABAergic dACs were Rbfox1-immunopositive. Furthermore, all cholinergic starburst ACs (SACs) in the INL (type a) and in the GCL (type b) were Rbfox1 positive. The expression of Rbfox1 in the retina significantly overlapped with expression of Rbfox2, another member of Rbfox family of proteins. Rbfox2, in addition to RGCs and ACs, was also expressed in horizontal cells. In developing retinas at E12 and E15, Rbfox1 is localized to the cytoplasm of differentiating RGCs and ACs. Between P0 and P5, Rbfox1 subcellular localization switched from cytoplasmic to predominantly nuclear. Downregulation of Rbfox1 in adult Rbfox1loxP/loxP mice had no detectable effect on retinal gross morphology. However, the visual cliff test revealed marked abnormalities of depth perception of these animals. RNA sequencing of retinal transcriptomes of control and Rbfox1 knockout animals identified a number of Rbfox1-regulated genes that are involved in establishing neuronal circuits and synaptic transmission, including Vamp1, Vamp2, Snap25, Trak2, and Slc1A7, suggesting the role of Rbfox1 in facilitating synaptic communications between ACs and RGCs.

30107177|t|Cooperative Enhancer Activation by TLX1 and STAT5 Drives Development of NUP214-ABL1/TLX1-Positive T Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
30107177|a|The NUP214-ABL1 fusion is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that is significantly associated with overexpression of the TLX1 and TLX3 transcription factors in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here we show that NUP214-ABL1 cooperates with TLX1 in driving T-ALL development using a transgenic mouse model and human T-ALL cells. Using integrated ChIP-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, and RNA-sequencing data, we demonstrate that TLX1 and STAT5, the downstream effector of NUP214-ABL1, co-bind poised enhancer regions, and cooperatively activate the expression of key proto-oncogenes such as MYC and BCL2. Inhibition of STAT5, downregulation of TLX1 or MYC, or interference with enhancer function through BET-inhibitor treatment leads to reduction of target gene expression and induction of leukemia cell death.

30114225|t|Activation of Nrf2 in the liver is associated with stress resistance mediated by suppression of the growth hormone-regulated STAT5b transcription factor.
30114225|a|The transcription factor Nrf2 (encoded by Nfe2l2) induces expression of numerous detoxifying and antioxidant genes in response to oxidative stress. The cytoplasmic protein Keap1 interacts with and represses Nrf2 function. Computational approaches were developed to identify factors that modulate Nrf2 in a mouse liver gene expression compendium. Forty-eight Nrf2 biomarker genes were identified using profiles from the livers of mice in which Nrf2 was activated genetically in Keap1-null mice or chemically by a potent activator of Nrf2 signaling. The rank-based Running Fisher statistical test was used to determine the correlation between the Nrf2 biomarker genes and a test set of 81 profiles with known Nrf2 activation status demonstrating a balanced accuracy of 96%. For a large number of factors examined in the compendium, we found consistent relationships between activation of Nrf2 and feminization of the liver transcriptome through suppression of the male-specific growth hormone (GH)-regulated transcription factor STAT5b. The livers of female mice exhibited higher Nrf2 activation than male mice in untreated or chemical-treated conditions. In male mice, Nrf2 was activated by treatment with ethinyl estradiol, whereas in female mice, Nrf2 was suppressed by treatment with testosterone. Nrf2 was activated in 5 models of disrupted GH signaling containing mutations in Pit1, Prop1, Ghrh, Ghrhr, and Ghr. Out of 59 chemical treatments that activated Nrf2, 36 exhibited STAT5b suppression in the male liver. The Nrf2-STAT5b coupling was absent in in vitro comparisons of chemical treatments. Treatment of male and female mice with 11 chemicals that induce oxidative stress led to activation of Nrf2 to greater extents in females than males. The enhanced basal and inducible levels of Nrf2 activation in females relative to males provides a molecular explanation for the greater resistance often seen in females vs. males to age-dependent diseases and chemical-induced toxicity.

30372497|t|Cyp1b1 expression impacts the angiogenic and inflammatory properties of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.
30372497|a|Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is a member of the cytochrome p450 family of enzymes that catalyze mono-oxygenase reactions. Although constitutive Cyp1b1 expression is limited in hepatocytes, its expression and function in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) remains unknown. Here we determined the impact of Cyp1b1 expression on LSEC properties prepared from Cyp1b1+/+ and Cyp1b1-/- mice. LSEC expressed PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, and B4 lectin similar to EC from other mouse tissues. Cyp1b1 +/+ LSEC constitutively expressed significant levels of Cyp1b1, while Cyp1b1-/- LSEC lacked Cyp1b1 expression. LSEC also expressed VEGFR3, PROX-1, and LYVE-1, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, as well as other cell adhesion molecules including ICAM-1, ICAM-2, VCAM-1, and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) receptors, CD36 and CD47. However, the expression of PV-1 and stabilin (fenestration markers), and endoglin were limited in these cells. The Cyp1b1-/- LSEC showed limited fenestration, and decreased levels of VEGF and BMP6. Cyp1b1-/- LSEC also showed a decrease in the levels of VE-cadherin and ZO-1 impacting adherens and gap junction formation. Cyp1b1-/- LSEC were significantly more apoptotic, proliferated at a faster rate, and were less adherent and more migratory. These changes were attributed, in part, to decreased amounts of TSP1 and increased AKT and ERK activation. The expressions of integrins were also altered by the lack of Cyp1b1, but the ability of these cells to undergo capillary morphogenesis was minimally affected. Furthermore, Cyp1b1-/- LSEC expressed lower levels of inflammatory mediators MCP-1 and TNF-alpha. Thus, Cyp1b1 expression has a significant impact on LSEC angiogenic and inflammatory functions.

30377154|t|The Yeast DNA Damage Checkpoint Kinase Rad53 Targets the Exoribonuclease, Xrn1.
30377154|a|The highly conserved DNA damage response (DDR) pathway monitors the genomic integrity of the cell and protects against genotoxic stresses. The apical kinases, Mec1 and Tel1 (ATR and ATM in human, respectively), initiate the DNA damage signaling cascade through the effector kinases, Rad53 and Chk1, to regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling, and transcription. The DDR also regulates other cellular pathways, but direct substrates and mechanisms are still lacking. Using a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified novel targets of Rad53, many of which are proteins that are involved in RNA metabolism. Of the 33 novel substrates identified, we verified that 12 are directly phosphorylated by Rad53 in vitro: Xrn1, Gcd11, Rps7b, Ded1, Cho2, Pus1, Hst1, Srv2, Set3, Snu23, Alb1, and Scp160. We further characterized Xrn1, a highly conserved 5' exoribonuclease that functions in RNA degradation and the most enriched in our phosphoproteomics screen. Phosphorylation of Xrn1 by Rad53 does not appear to affect Xrn1's intrinsic nuclease activity in vitro, but may affect its activity or specificity in vivo.

30462722|t|MicroRNA-451a overexpression induces accelerated neuronal differentiation of Ntera2/D1 cells and ablation affects neurogenesis in microRNA-451a-/- mice.
30462722|a|MiR-451a is best known for its role in erythropoiesis and for its tumour suppressor features. Here we show a role for miR-451a in neuronal differentiation through analysis of endogenous and ectopically expressed or silenced miR-451a in Ntera2/D1 cells during neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we compared neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus of miR-451a-/- and wild type mice. MiR-451a overexpression in lentiviral transduced Ntera2/D1 cells was associated with a significant shifting of mRNA expression of the developmental markers Nestin, betaIII Tubulin, NF200, DCX and MAP2 to earlier developmental time points, compared to control vector transduced cells. In line with this, accelerated neuronal network formation in AB.G.miR-451a transduced cells, as well as an increase in neurite outgrowth both in number and length was observed. MiR-451a targets genes MIF, AKT1, CAB39, YWHAZ, RAB14, TSC1, OSR1, POU3F2, TNS4, PSMB8, CXCL16, CDKN2D and IL6R were, moreover, either constantly downregulated or exhibited shifted expression profiles in AB.G.miR-451a transduced cells. Lentiviral knockdown of endogenous miR-451a expression in Ntera2/D1 cells resulted in decelerated differentiation. Endogenous miR-451a expression was upregulated during development in the hippocampus of wildtype mice. In situ hybridization revealed intensively stained single cells in the subgranular zone and the hilus of the dentate gyrus of wild type mice, while genetic ablation of miR-451a was observed to promote an imbalance between proliferation and neuronal differentiation in neurogenic brain regions, suggested by Ki67 and DCX staining. Taken together, these results provide strong support for a role of miR-451a in neuronal maturation processes in vitro and in vivo.

30478082|t|Conditional Inactivation of Nf1 and Pten in Schwann Cells Results in Abnormal Neuromuscular Junction Maturation.
30478082|a|The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) consists of three components, namely presynaptic motor neurons, postsynaptic muscle fibers and perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs). The role of Schwann cells (SCs) in regulating NMJ structural and functional development remains unclear. In this study, mice with conditional inactivation of neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), specifically in SCs, resulted in delayed NMJ maturation that led to delayed muscle growth, recapitulating the muscular dystrophy condition observed in human neurofibromatosis type I syndrome (NF1) patients. Expression levels of NMJ development related molecules such as cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, alpha polypeptide 1 (Chrna1), agrin (Agrn), dystrophin, muscular dystrophy (Dmd), laminin, beta 2 (Lamb2) and dystroglycan 1 (Dag1) were also downregulated. To further explore the molecular alterations in these SCs, NF1- and PTEN-related pathways were analyzed in mutant sciatic nerves. As expected, hyperactive RAS/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways were identified, suggesting the importance of these pathways for NMJ development, and subsequent muscle maturation.

30915128|t|Melatonin receptor depletion suppressed hCG-induced testosterone expression in mouse Leydig cells.
30915128|a|Melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 (genes officially named MTNR1A and MTNR1B, respectively) play crucial roles in melatonin-mediated regulation of circadian rhythms, the immune system, and control of reproduction in seasonally breeding animals. In this study, immunolocalization assay showed that MT1 and MT2 are highly expressed in Leydig cell membrane. To understand the biological function of melatonin receptors in hCG-induced testosterone synthesis, we generated melatonin receptor knockdown cells using specific siRNA and performed testosterone detection after hCG treatment. We found that knockdown of melatonin receptors, especially MTNR1A, led to an obvious decrease (> 60%) of testosterone level. Our further study revealed that knockdown of melatonin receptors repressed expression, at both the mRNA level and the protein level, of key steroidogenic genes, such as p450scc, p450c17 and StAR, which are essential for testosterone synthesis. hCG triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to regulate steroidogenic genes' expression and apoptosis. To further investigate the potential roles of melatonin receptors in hCG-induced regulation of ER stress and apoptosis, we examined expression of some crucial ER stress markers, including Grp78, Chop, ATF4, Xbp1, and IRE1. We found that inhibition of melatonin receptors increased hCG-induced expression of Grp78, Chop and ATF4, but not Xbp1 and IRE1, suggesting that hCG may modulate IRE1 signaling pathways in a melatonin receptor-dependent manner. In addition, our further data showed that knockdown of MTNR1A and MTNR1B promoted hCG-induced expression of apoptosis markers, including p53, caspase-3 and Bcl-2. These results suggested that the melatonin receptors MTNR1A and MTNR1B are essential to repress hCG-induced ER stress and cell apoptosis. Our studies demonstrated that the mammalian melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 are involved in testosterone synthesis via mediating multiple cell pathways.

30991764|t|Use of Physcion to Improve Atopic Dermatitis-Like Skin Lesions through Blocking of Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin.
30991764|a|Physcion is well known for the treatment of carcinoma. However, the therapeutic effect of physcion on atopic dermatitis (AD) through the inhibition of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) level remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the anti-AD effect of physcion using HMC-1 cells, splenocytes, and a murine model. Treatment with physcion decreased production and mRNA expression levels of TSLP, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in activated HMC-1 cells. Physcion reduced the expression levels of RIP2/caspase-1 and phospho (p)ERK/pJNK/pp38 in activated HMC-1 cells. Physcion suppressed the expression levels of pIKKbeta/NF-kappaB/pIkB in activated HMC-1 cells. Moreover, physcion attenuated the production levels of TSLP, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-, and IFN-gamma from activated splenocytes. Oral administration of physcion improved the severity of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced AD-like lesional skin through reducing infiltration of inflammatory cells and mast cells, and the protein and mRNA levels of TSLP, IL-4, and IL-6 in the lesional skin tissues. Physcion attenuated histamine, IgE, TSLP, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF- levels in serum. In addition, physcion inhibited caspase-1 activation in the lesional skin tissues. These findings indicate that physcion could ameliorate AD-like skin lesions by inhibiting TSLP levels via caspase-1/MAPKs/NF-kB signalings, which would provide experimental evidence of the therapeutic potential of physcion for AD.

12805933|t|Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase-2 gene: structure and transcriptional regulation of the human gene.
12805933|a|The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCAs) belong to a family of active calcium transport enzymes encoded by the SERCA1, 2, and 3 genes. In this study, we describe the complete structure of the human SERCA2 gene and its 5 -regulatory region. The hSERCA2 gene is located in chromosome 12 position q24.1 in Contig NT_009770.8, spans 70 kb, and is organized in 21 exons intervened by 20 introns. The last two exons of the pre-mRNA produce by alternatively splicing the cardiac/slow-twitch muscle-specific SERCA2a isoform and the ubiquitous SERCA2b isoform. The sequence of the proximal 225-bp regulatory region of the SERCA2 genes is 80% G+C-rich and is conserved among human, rabbit, rat, and mouse species. It contains a TATA-like-box, an E-box/USF sequence, a CAAT-box, four Sp1 binding sites, and a thyroid hormone responsive element (TRE). There are two other conserved regulatory regions located between positions -410 to -661 bp and from -919 to -1410 bp. Among the DNA cis-elements present in these two regulatory regions there are potential binding sites for: GATA-4, -5, -6, Nkx-2.5/Csx, OTF-1, USF, MEF-2, SRF, PPAR/RXR, AP-2, and TREs. Upstream from position -1.5 kb, there is no significant homology among the SERCA2 genes cloned. In addition, the human gene has several repeated sequences mainly of the Alu and L2 type located upstream from position -1.7 kb, spanning in a continuous fashion for more than 40 kb. In this study, we report the cloning of 2.4 kb of 5-regulatory region and demonstrate that the proximal promoter region is sufficient for expression in cardiac myocytes, and the region from -225 to -1232 bp contains regulatory DNA elements which down-regulate the expression of the SERCA2 gene in neonatal cardiomyocytes.

16573830|t|Increased proinflammatory endothelial response to S100A8/A9 after preactivation through advanced glycation end products.
16573830|a|BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease in which a perpetuated activation of NFkappaB via the RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products)-MAPK signalling pathway may play an important pathogenetic role. As recently S100 proteins have been identified as ligands of RAGE, we sought to determine the effects of the proinflammatory heterodimer of S100A8/S100A9 on the RAGE-NFkappaB mediated induction of proinflammatory gene expression. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were preincubated for 72 h with AGE-albumin or unmodified albumin for control, whereas AGE-albumin induction resulted in an upregulation of RAGE. Following this preactivation, cells were stimulated for 48 h with heterodimeric human recombinant S100A8/S100A9. RESULTS: Heterodimeric S100A8/S100A9 enhanced secretion of IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MCP1 in AGE-albumin pretreated HUVEC in a dose dependent manner. These effects could not be detected after stimulation with the homodimeric proteins S100A8, S100A9, S100A1 and S100B. The effects of heterodimeric S100A8/S100A9 were reduced by inhibition of the MAP-kinase pathways ERK1/2 and p38 by PD 98059 and SB 203580, respectively. CONCLUSION: The heterodimeric S100A8/S100A9 might therefore play a hitherto unknown role in triggering atherosclerosis in diabetes and renal failure, pathophysiological entities associated with a high AGE burden. Thus, blocking heterodimeric S100A8/S100A9 might represent a novel therapeutic modality in treating atherosclerosis.

17223997|t|Human growth hormone (GH1) gene polymorphism map in a normal-statured adult population.
17223997|a|OBJECTIVE: GH1 gene presents a complex map of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the entire promoter, coding and noncoding regions. The aim of the study was to establish the complete map of GH1 gene SNPs in our control normal population and to analyse its association with adult height. DESIGN, SUBJECTS AND MEASUREMENTS: A systematic GH1 gene analysis was designed in a control population of 307 adults of both sexes with height normally distributed within normal range for the same population: -2 standard deviation scores (SDS) to +2 SDS. An analysis was performed on individual and combined genotype associations with adult height. RESULTS: Twenty-five SNPs presented a frequency over 1%: 11 in the promoter (P1 to P11), three in the 5'UTR region (P12 to P14), one in exon 1 (P15), three in intron 1 (P16 to P18), two in intron 2 (P19 and P20), two in exon 4 (P21 and P22) and three in intron 4 (P23 to P25). Twenty-nine additional changes with frequencies under 1% were found in 29 subjects. P8, P19, P20 and P25 had not been previously described. P6, P12, P17 and P25 accounted for 6.2% of the variation in adult height (P = 0.0007) in this population with genotypes A/G at P6, G/G at P6 and A/G at P12 decreasing height SDS (-0.063 +/- 0.031, -0.693 +/- 0.350 and -0.489 +/- 0.265, Mean +/- SE) and genotypes A/T at P17 and T/G at P25 increasing height SDS (+1.094 +/- 0.456 and +1.184 +/- 0.432). CONCLUSIONS: This study established the GH1 gene sequence variation map in a normal adult height control population confirming the high density of SNPs in a relatively small gene. Our study shows that the more frequent SNPs did not significantly contribute to height determination, while only one promoter and two intronic SNPs contributed significantly to it. Studies in larger populations will have to confirm the associations and in vitro functional studies will elucidate the mechanisms involved. Systematic GH1 gene analysis in patients with growth delay and suspected GH deficiency/insufficiency will clarify whether different SNP frequencies and/or the presence of different sequence changes may be associated with phenotypes in them.

17355643|t|Frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes regulating inflammatory responses in a community-based population.
17355643|a|BACKGROUND: Allele frequencies reported from public databases or articles are mostly based on small sample sizes. Differences in genotype frequencies by age, race and sex have implications for studies designed to examine genetic susceptibility to disease. In a community-based cohort of 9,960 individuals, we compared the allele frequencies of 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes involved in inflammatory pathways to the frequencies reported on public databases, and examined the genotypes frequencies by age and sex. The genes in which SNPs were analyzed include CCR2, CCR5, COX1, COX2, CRP, CSF1, CSF2, IFNG, IL1A, IL1B, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL13, IL18, LTA, MPO, NOS2A, NOS3, PPARD, PPARG, PPARGC1 and TNF. RESULTS: Mean(SD) age was 53.2(15.5); 98% were Caucasians and 62% were women. Only 1 out of 33 SNPs differed from the SNP500Cancer database in allele frequency by    >10% in Caucasians (n = 9,831), whereas 12 SNPs differed by    >10% (up to 50%) in African Americans (n = 105). Two out of 15 SNPs differed from the dbSNP database in allele frequencies by    >10% in Caucasians, and 5 out of 15 SNPs differed by    >10% in African Americans. Age was similar across most genotype groups. Genotype frequencies did not differ by sex except for TNF(rs1799724), IL2(rs2069762), IL10(rs1800890), PPARG(rs1801282), and CRP(rs1800947) with differences of less than 4%. CONCLUSION: When estimating the size of samples needed for a study, particularly if a reference sample is used, one should take into consideration the size and ethnicity of the reference sample. Larger sample size is needed for public databases that report allele frequencies in non-Caucasian populations.

17397547|t|Regulatory network of inflammation downstream of proteinase-activated receptors.
17397547|a|BACKGROUND: Protease-activated receptors (PAR) are present in the urinary bladder, and their expression is altered in response to inflammation. PARs are a unique class of G protein-coupled that carry their own ligands, which remain cryptic until unmasked by proteolytic cleavage. Although the canonical signal transduction pathway downstream of PAR activation and coupling with various G proteins is known and leads to the rapid transcription of genes involved in inflammation, the effect of PAR activation on the downstream transcriptome is unknown. We have shown that intravesical administration of PAR-activating peptides leads to an inflammatory reaction characterized by edema and granulocyte infiltration. Moreover, the inflammatory response to intravesical instillation of known pro-inflammatory stimuli such as E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), substance P (SP), and antigen was strongly attenuated by PAR1- and to a lesser extent by PAR2-deficiency. RESULTS: Here, cDNA array experiments determined inflammatory genes whose expression is dependent on PAR1 activation. For this purpose, we compared the alteration in gene expression in wild type and PAR1-/- mice induced by classical pro-inflammatory stimuli (LPS, SP, and antigen). 75 transcripts were considered to be dependent on PAR-1 activation and further annotated in silico by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) and gene ontology (GO). Selected transcripts were target validated by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Among PAR1-dependent transcripts, the following have been implicated in the inflammatory process: b2m, ccl7, cd200, cd63, cdbpd, cfl1, dusp1, fkbp1a, fth1, hspb1, marcksl1, mmp2, myo5a, nfkbia, pax1, plaur, ppia, ptpn1, ptprcap, s100a10, sim2, and tnfaip2. However, a balanced response to signals of injury requires a transient cellular activation of a panel of genes together with inhibitory systems that temper the overwhelming inflammation. In this context, the activation of genes such as dusp1 and nfkbia seems to counter-balance the inflammatory response to PAR activation by limiting prolonged activation of p38 MAPK and increased cytokine production. In contrast, transcripts such as arf6 and dcnt1 that are involved in the mechanism of PAR re-sensitization would tend to perpetuate the inflammatory reaction in response to common pro-inflammatory stimuli. CONCLUSION: The combination of cDNA array results and genomic networks reveals an overriding participation of PAR1 in bladder inflammation, provides a working model for the involvement of downstream signaling, and evokes testable hypotheses regarding the transcriptome downstream of PAR1 activation. It remains to be determined whether or not mechanisms targeting PAR1 gene silencing or PAR1 blockade will ameliorate the clinical manifestation of cystitis.

17612403|t|echinus, required for interommatidial cell sorting and cell death in the Drosophila pupal retina, encodes a protein with homology to ubiquitin-specific proteases.
17612403|a|BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death is used to remove excess cells between ommatidia in the Drosophila pupal retina. This death is required to establish the crystalline, hexagonal packing of ommatidia that characterizes the adult fly eye. In previously described echinus mutants, interommatidial cell sorting, which precedes cell death, occurred relatively normally. Interommatidial cell death was partially suppressed, resulting in adult eyes that contained excess pigment cells, and in which ommatidia were mildly disordered. These results have suggested that echinus functions in the pupal retina primarily to promote interommatidial cell death. RESULTS: We generated a number of new echinus alleles, some likely null mutants. Analysis of these alleles provides evidence that echinus has roles in cell sorting as well as cell death. echinus encodes a protein with homology to ubiquitin-specific proteases. These proteins cleave ubiquitin-conjugated proteins at the ubiquitin C-terminus. The echinus locus encodes multiple splice forms, including two proteins that lack residues thought to be critical for deubiquitination activity. Surprisingly, ubiquitous expression in the eye of versions of Echinus that lack residues critical for ubiquitin specific protease activity, as well as a version predicted to be functional, rescue the echinus loss-of-function phenotype. Finally, genetic interactions were not detected between echinus loss and gain-of-function and a number of known apoptotic regulators. These include Notch, EGFR, the caspases Dronc, Drice, Dcp-1, Dream, the caspase activators, Rpr, Hid, and Grim, the caspase inhibitor DIAP1, and Lozenge or Klumpfuss. CONCLUSION: The echinus locus encodes multiple splice forms of a protein with homology to ubiquitin-specific proteases, but protease activity is unlikely to be required for echinus function, at least when echinus is overexpressed. Characterization of likely echinus null alleles and genetic interactions suggests that echinus acts at a novel point(s) to regulate interommatidial cell sorting and/or cell death in the fly eye.

18187511|t|Saccharomyces cerevisiae HMO1 interacts with TFIID and participates in start site selection by RNA polymerase II.
18187511|a|Saccharomyces cerevisiae HMO1, a high mobility group B (HMGB) protein, associates with the rRNA locus and with the promoters of many ribosomal protein genes (RPGs). Here, the Sos recruitment system was used to show that HMO1 interacts with TBP and the N-terminal domain (TAND) of TAF1, which are integral components of TFIID. Biochemical studies revealed that HMO1 copurifies with TFIID and directly interacts with TBP but not with TAND. Deletion of HMO1 (Deltahmo1) causes a severe cold-sensitive growth defect and decreases transcription of some TAND-dependent genes. Deltahmo1 also affects TFIID occupancy at some RPG promoters in a promoter-specific manner. Interestingly, over-expression of HMO1 delays colony formation of taf1 mutants lacking TAND (taf1DeltaTAND), but not of the wild-type strain, indicating a functional link between HMO1 and TAND. Furthermore, Deltahmo1 exhibits synthetic growth defects in some spt15 (TBP) and toa1 (TFIIA) mutants while it rescues growth defects of some sua7 (TFIIB) mutants. Importantly, Deltahmo1 causes an upstream shift in transcriptional start sites of RPS5, RPS16A, RPL23B, RPL27B and RPL32, but not of RPS31, RPL10, TEF2 and ADH1, indicating that HMO1 may participate in start site selection of a subset of class II genes presumably via its interaction with TFIID.

18309293|t|Plx1 is required for chromosomal DNA replication under stressful conditions.
18309293|a|Polo-like kinase (Plk)1 is required for mitosis progression. However, although Plk1 is expressed throughout the cell cycle, its function during S-phase is unknown. Using Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we demonstrate that Plx1, the Xenopus orthologue of Plk1, is required for DNA replication in the presence of stalled replication forks induced by aphidicolin, etoposide or reduced levels of DNA-bound Mcm complexes. Plx1 binds to chromatin and suppresses the ATM/ATR-dependent intra-S-phase checkpoint that inhibits origin firing. This allows Cdc45 loading and derepression of DNA replication initiation. Checkpoint activation increases Plx1 binding to the Mcm complex through its Polo box domain. Plx1 recruitment to chromatin is independent of checkpoint mediators Tipin and Claspin. Instead, ATR-dependent phosphorylation of serine 92 of Mcm2 is required for the recruitment of Plx1 to chromatin and for the recovery of DNA replication under stress. Depletion of Plx1 leads to accumulation of chromosomal breakage that is prevented by the addition of recombinant Plx1. These data suggest that Plx1 promotes genome stability by regulating DNA replication under stressful conditions.

18489763|t|Plasma IP-10, apoptotic and angiogenic factors associated with fatal cerebral malaria in India.
18489763|a|BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum in a subset of patients can lead to cerebral malaria (CM), a major contributor to malaria-associated mortality. Despite treatment, CM mortality can be as high as 30%, while 10% of survivors of the disease may experience short- and long-term neurological complications. The pathogenesis of CM is mediated by alterations in cytokine and chemokine homeostasis, inflammation as well as vascular injury and repair processes although their roles are not fully understood. The hypothesis for this study is that CM-induced changes in inflammatory, apoptotic and angiogenic factors mediate severity of CM and that their identification will enable development of new prognostic markers and adjunctive therapies for preventing CM mortalities. METHODS: Plasma samples (133) were obtained from healthy controls (HC, 25), mild malaria (MM, 48), cerebral malaria survivors (CMS, 48), and cerebral malaria non-survivors (CMNS, 12) at admission to the hospital in Jabalpur, India. Plasma levels of 30 biomarkers ((IL-1beta, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, Eotaxin, FGF basic protein, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IP-10, MCP-1 (MCAF), MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES, TNF-alpha, Fas-ligand (Fas-L), soluble Fas (sFas), soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNF-R1) and soluble TNF receptor 2 (sTNFR-2), PDGF bb and VEGF)) were simultaneously measured in an initial subset of ten samples from each group. Only those biomarkers which showed significant differences in the pilot analysis were chosen for testing on all remaining samples. The results were then compared between the four groups to determine their role in CM severity. RESULTS: IP-10, sTNF-R2 and sFas were independently associated with increased risk of CM associated mortality. CMNS patients had a significantly lower level of the neuroprotective factor VEGF when compared to other groups (P    < 0.0045). The ratios of VEGF to IP-10, sTNF-R2, and sFas distinguished CM survivors from non survivors (P    < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that plasma levels of IP-10, sTNF-R2 and sFas may be potential biomarkers of CM severity and mortality. VEGF was found to be protective against CM associated mortality and may be considered for adjunctive therapy to improve the treatment outcome in CM patients.

18507837|t|Effects of common germline genetic variation in cell cycle control genes on breast cancer survival: results from a population-based cohort.
18507837|a|INTRODUCTION: Somatic alterations have been shown to correlate with breast cancer prognosis and survival, but less is known about the effects of common inherited genetic variation. Of particular interest are genes involved in cell cycle pathways, which regulate cell division. METHODS: We examined associations between common germline genetic variation in 13 genes involved in cell cycle control (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CDK2 [p33], CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A [p21, Cip1], CDKN1B [p27, Kip1], CDKN2A [p16], CDKN2B [p15], CDKN2C [p18], and CDKN2D [p19]) and survival among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer participating in the SEARCH (Studies of Epidemiology and Risk factors in Cancer Heredity) breast cancer study. DNA from up to 4,470 women was genotyped for 85 polymorphisms that tag the known common polymorphisms (minor allele frequency    > 0.05) in the genes. The genotypes of each polymorphism were tested for association with survival using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The rare allele of the tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2479717 is associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.26 per rare allele carried, 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.42; P = 0.0001), which was not attenuated after adjusting for tumour stage, grade, and treatment. This SNP is part of a large linkage disequilibrium block, which contains CCND3, BYSL, TRFP, USP49, C6ofr49, FRS3, and PGC. We evaluated the association of survival and somatic expression of these genes in breast tumours using expression microarray data from seven published datasets. Elevated expression of the C6orf49 transcript was associated with breast cancer survival, adding biological interest to the finding. CONCLUSION: It is possible that CCND3 rs2479717, or another variant it tags, is associated with prognosis after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Further study is required to validate this finding.

18627611|t|Transcriptional profiling in C. elegans suggests DNA damage dependent apoptosis as an ancient function of the p53 family.
18627611|a|BACKGROUND: In contrast to the three mammalian p53 family members, p53, which is generally involved in DNA damage responses, and p63 and p73 which are primarily needed for developmental regulation, cep-1 encodes for the single C. elegans p53-like gene. cep-1 acts as a transcription activator in a primordial p53 pathway that involves CEP-1 activation and the CEP-1 dependent transcriptional induction of the worm BH3 only domain encoding genes egl-1 and ced-13 to induce germ cell apoptosis. EGL-1 and CED-13 proteins inactivate Bcl-2 like CED-9 to trigger CED-4 and CED-3 caspase dependent germ cell apoptosis. To address the function of p53 in global transcriptional regulation we investigate genome-wide transcriptional responses upon DNA damage and cep-1 deficiency. RESULTS: Examining C. elegans expression profiles using whole genome Affymetrix GeneChip arrays, we found that 83 genes were induced more than two fold upon ionizing radiation (IR). None of these genes, with exception of an ATP ribosylase homolog, encode for known DNA repair genes. Using two independent cep-1 loss of function alleles we did not find genes regulated by cep-1 in the absence of IR. Among the IR-induced genes only three are dependent on cep-1, namely egl-1, ced-13 and a novel C. elegans specific gene. The majority of IR-induced genes appear to be involved in general stress responses, and qRT-PCR experiments indicate that they are mainly expressed in somatic tissues. Interestingly, we reveal an extensive overlap of gene expression changes occurring in response to DNA damage and in response to bacterial infection. Furthermore, many genes induced by IR are also transcriptionally regulated in longevity mutants suggesting that DNA damage and aging induce an overlapping stress response. CONCLUSION: We performed genome-wide gene expression analyses which indicate that only a surprisingly small number of genes are regulated by CEP-1 and that DNA damage induced apoptosis via the transcriptional induction of BH3 domain proteins is likely to be an ancient DNA damage response function of the p53 family. Interestingly, although the apoptotic response to DNA damage is regulated through the transcriptional activity of CEP-1, other DNA damage responses do not appear to be regulated on the transcriptional level and do not require the p53 like gene cep-1.

18673534|t|Androgen regulation of the androgen receptor coregulators.
18673534|a|BACKGROUND: The critical role of the androgen receptor (AR) in the development of prostate cancer is well recognized. The transcriptional activity of AR is partly regulated by coregulatory proteins. It has been suggested that these coregulators could also be important in the progression of prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to identify coregulators whose expression is regulated by either the androgens and/or by the expression level of AR. METHODS: We used empty vector and AR cDNA-transfected LNCaP cells (LNCaP-pcDNA3.1, and LNCaP-ARhi, respectively), and grew them for 4 and 24 hours in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at various concentrations. The expression of 25 AR coregulators (SRC1, TIF2, PIAS1, PIASx, ARIP4, BRCA1, beta-catenin, AIB3, AIB1, CBP, STAT1, NCoR1, AES, cyclin D1, p300, ARA24, LSD1, BAG1L, gelsolin, prohibitin, JMJD2C, JMJD1A, MAK, PAK6 and MAGE11) was then measured by using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR). RESULTS: Five of the coregulators (AIB1, CBP, MAK, BRCA1 and beta-catenin) showed more than 2-fold induction and 5 others (cyclin D1, gelsolin, prohibitin, JMJD1A, and JMJD2C) less than 2-fold induction. Overexpression of AR did not affect the expression of the coregulators alone. However, overexpression of AR enhanced the DHT-stimulated expression of MAK, BRCA1, AIB1 and CBP and reduced the level of expression of beta-catenin, cyclinD1 and gelsolin. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we identified 5 coactivators whose expression was induced by androgens suggesting that they could potentiate AR signaling. Overexpression of AR seems to sensitize cells for low levels of androgens.

18719403|t|The Drosophila protein palmitoylome: characterizing palmitoyl-thioesterases and DHHC palmitoyl-transferases.
18719403|a|Palmitoylation is the post-translational addition of a palmitate moiety to a cysteine residue through a covalent thioester bond. The addition and removal of this modification is controlled by both palmitoyl acyl-transferases and thioesterases. Using bioinformatic analysis, we identified 22 DHHC family palmitoyl acyl-transferase homologs in the Drosophila genome. We used in situ hybridization,RT-PCR, and published FlyAtlas microarray data to characterize the expression patterns of all 22 fly homologs. Our results indicate that all are expressed genes, but several, including CG1407, CG4676, CG5620, CG6017/dHIP14, CG6618, CG6627 and CG17257 appear to be enriched in neural tissues suggesting that they are important for neural function. Furthermore, we have found that several may be expressed in a sex-specific manner with adult male specific expression of CG4483 and CG17195. Using tagged versions of the DHHC genes, we demonstrate that fly DHHC proteins are primarily located in either the Golgi Apparatus or Endoplasmic Reticulum in S2 cells, except for CG1407, which was found on the plasma membrane. We also characterized the subcellular localization and expression of the three known thioesterases: Palmitoyl-protein Thioesterase 1 (Ppt1), Palmitoyl-protein Thioesterase 2 (Ppt2)and Acyl-protein Thioesterase 1 (APT1). Our results indicate that Ppt1 and Ppt2 are the major lysosomal thioesterases while APT1 is the likely cytoplasmic thioesterase. Finally, in vivo rescue experiments show that Ppt2 expression cannot rescue the neural inclusion phenotypes associated with loss of Ppt1, further supporting distinct functions and substrates for these two thioesterases. These results will serve as the basis for a more complete understanding of the protein palmitoylome's normal cellular functions in the fly and will lead to further insights into the molecular etiology of diseases associated with the mis-regulation of palmitoylation.

18949367|t|Over-expression of ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolase-L1 induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
18949367|a|Ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) belongs to the UCH proteases family that deubiquitinates ubiquitin-protein conjugates in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Previous research showed that UCH-L1 was expressed in mouse retinal cells and testicular germ cells, and its function was associated with apoptosis. But it is still unclear whether UCH-L1 is concerned with apoptosis in tumor cells. In order to clarify the role of UCH-L1 in tumor cells, multi-drug resistance (MDR) human breast carcinoma cell line MCF7/Adr, that expresses relatively high UCH-L1, and its parental cell line MCF7, that expresses relatively low UCH-L1, were chosen for this study. We transfected pcDNA3.1-UCH-L1 plasmid and UCH-L1 siRNA into MCF7 and MCF7/Adr cells, respectively. Using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, western blot, Hoechst 33258 staining assay and flow cytometry, we found that over-expression of UCH-L1 in MCF7 cells induced apoptosis. On the other hand, silencing of UCH-L1 in MCF7/Adr cells led to the opposite effect. Moreover, to explore the mechanism underling these observations, we further investigated the expression of phospho-Akt and its downstream signal phospho-IkB-alpha and other signal molecules including Fas, Fas-L, Trail, DR4, DR5, Bax, cytochrome C, active caspase-3, phospho-p53, phospho-Mdm-2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, p21 and p27. The results indicated that the process of apoptosis triggered by UCH-L1 is, at least in part, probably through Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signal pathway. Our findings suggest that modulating the ubiquitination and deubiquitination pathway could be a novel method for tumor therapy.

19114665|t|Lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells are an innate source of IL-17 and IL-22.
19114665|a|The interleukin (IL) 17 family of cytokines has emerged to be critical for host defense as well as the pathogenesis of autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, and serves to link adaptive and innate responses. Recent studies have identified a new subset of T cells that selectively produce IL-17 (Th17 cells; Bettelli, E., T. Korn, and V.K. Kuchroo. 2007. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 19:652-657; Kolls, J.K., and A. Linden. 2004. Immunity. 21:467-476), but the regulation of IL-17 production by innate immune cells is less well understood. We report that in vitro stimulation with IL-23 induced IL-17 production by recombination activating gene (Rag) 2(-/-) splenocytes but not Rag2(-/-) common gamma chain(-/-) splenocytes. We found that a major source of IL-17 was CD4(+)CD3(-)NK1.1(-)CD11b(-)Gr1(-)CD11c(-)B220(-) cells, a phenotype that corresponds to lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells (LTi-like cells), which constitutively expressed the IL-23 receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and CCR6. In vivo challenge with the yeast cell wall product zymosan rapidly induced IL-17 production in these cells. Genetic deletion of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 reduced but did not abrogate IL-17 production in LTi-like cells. Thus, it appears that splenic LTi-like cells are a rapid source of IL-17 and IL-22, which might contribute to dynamic organization of secondary lymphoid organ structure or host defense.

19430421|t|SIRT1 histone deacetylase expression is associated with microsatellite instability and CpG island methylator phenotype in colorectal cancer.
19430421|a|The class III histone deacetylase SIRT1 (sir2) is important in epigenetic gene silencing. Inhibition of SIRT1 reactivates silenced genes, suggesting a possible therapeutic approach of targeted reversal of aberrantly silenced genes. In addition, SIRT1 may be involved in the well-known link between obesity, cellular energy balance and cancer. However, a comprehensive study of SIRT1 using human cancer tissue with clinical outcome data is currently lacking, and its prognostic significance is uncertain. Using the database of 485 colorectal cancers in two independent prospective cohort studies, we detected SIRT1 overexpression in 180 (37%) tumors by immunohistochemistry. We examined its relationship to the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), related molecular events, clinical features including body mass index, and patient survival. We quantified DNA methylation in eight CIMP-specific promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A, CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1) and eight other CpG islands (CHFR, HIC1, IGFBP3, MGMT, MINT1, MINT31, p14, and WRN) by MethyLight. SIRT1 overexpression was associated with CIMP-high (   > or =6 of 8 methylated CIMP-specific promoters, P=0.002) and microsatellite instability (MSI)-high phenotype (P   <0.0001). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, SIRT1 overexpression was significantly associated with the CIMP-high MSI-high phenotype (multivariate odds ratio, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-7.59; P=0.008). In addition, mucinous component (P=0.01), high tumor grade (P=0.02), and fatty acid synthase overexpression (P=0.04) were significantly associated with SIRT positivity in multivariate analysis. SIRT1 was not significantly related with age, sex, tumor location, stage, signet ring cells, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), LINE-1 hypomethylation, KRAS, BRAF, BMI, PIK3CA, HDAC, p53, beta-catenin, COX-2, or patient prognosis. In conclusion, SIRT1 expression is associated with CIMP-high MSI-high colon cancer, suggesting involvement of SIRT1 in gene silencing in this unique tumor subtype.

19438813|t|Derivation of a novel undifferentiated human foetal phenotype in serum-free cultures with BMP-2.
19438813|a|Skeletal stem and progenitor populations provide a platform for cell-based tissue regeneration strategies. Optimized conditions for ex vivo expansion will be critical and use of serum-free culture may allow enhanced modelling of differentiation potential. Maintenance of human foetal femur-derived cells in a chemically defined medium (CDM) with activin A and fibroblast growth factor-2 generated a unique undifferentiated cell population in comparison to basal cultures, with significantly reduced amino acid depletion, appearance and turnover, reduced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and loss of type I and II collagen expression demonstrated by fluorescence immunocytochemistry. Microarray analysis demonstrated up-regulation of CLU, OSR2, POSTN and RABGAP1 and down-regulation of differentiation-associated genes CRYAB, CSRP1, EPAS1, GREM1, MT1X and SRGN as validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Application of osteogenic conditions to CDM cultures demonstrated partial rescue of ALP activity. In contrast, the addition of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) resulted in reduced ALP levels, increased amino acid metabolism and, strikingly, a marked shift to a cobblestone-like cellular morphology, with expression of SOX-2 and SOX-9 but not STRO-1 as shown by immunocytochemistry, and significantly altered expression of metabolic genes (GFPT2, SC4MOL and SQLE), genes involved in morphogenesis (SOX15 and WIF1) and differentiation potential (C1orf19, CHSY-2,DUSP6, HMGCS1 and PPL). These studies demonstrate the use of an intermediary foetal cellular model for differentiation studies in chemically defined conditions and indicate the in vitro reconstruction of the mesenchymal condensation phenotype in the presence of BMP-2, with implications therein for rescue studies, screening assays and skeletal regeneration research.

19463742|t|Melanocortin-4 receptor activation inhibits c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity and promotes insulin signaling.
19463742|a|The melanocortin system is crucial to regulation of energy homeostasis. The melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R) modulates insulin signaling via effects on c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The melanocortin agonist NDP-MSH dose-dependently inhibited JNK activity in HEK293 cells stably expressing the human MC4R; effects were reversed by melanocortin receptor antagonist. NDP-MSH time- and dose-dependently inhibited IRS-1(ser307) phosphorylation, effects also reversed by a specific melanocortin receptor antagonist. NDP-MSH augmented insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in vitro. The melanocortin agonist melanotan II increased insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in the rat hypothalamus in vivo. NDP-MSH increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in hypothalamic GT1-1 cells. The current study shows that the melanocortinergic system interacts with insulin signaling via novel effects on JNK activity.

19481073|t|Notch signaling is required for lateral induction of Jagged1 during FGF-induced lens fiber differentiation.
19481073|a|Previous studies of the developing lens have shown that Notch signaling regulates differentiation of lens fiber cells by maintaining a proliferating precursor pool in the anterior epithelium. However, whether Notch signaling is further required after the onset of fiber cell differentiation is not clear. This work investigates the role of Notch2 and Jagged1 (Jag1) in secondary fiber cell differentiation using rat lens epithelial explants undergoing FGF-2 dependent differentiation in vitro. FGF induced Jag1 expression and Notch2 signaling (as judged by the appearance of activated Notch2 Intracellular Domain (N2ICD)) within 12-24 h. These changes were correlated with induction of the Notch effector, Hes5, upregulation of N-cadherin (N-cad), and downregulation of E-cadherin (E-cad), a cadherin switch characteristic of fiber cell differentiation. Induction of Jag1 was efficiently blocked by U0126, a specific inhibitor of MAPK/ERK signaling, indicating a requirement for signaling through this pathway downstream of the FGF receptor. Other growth factors that activate MAPK/ERK signaling (EGF, PDGF, IGF) did not induce Jag1. Inhibition of Notch signaling using gamma secretase inhibitors DAPT and L-685,458 or anti-Jag1 antibody markedly decreased FGF-dependent expression of Jag1 demonstrating Notch-dependent lateral induction. In addition, inhibition of Notch signaling reduced expression of N-cad, and the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p57Kip2, indicating a direct role for Notch signaling in secondary fiber cell differentiation. These results demonstrate that Notch-mediated lateral induction of Jag1 is an essential component of FGF-dependent lens fiber cell differentiation.

19536134|t|TAK1 is an essential regulator of BMP signalling in cartilage.
19536134|a|TGFbeta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the MAPKKK family, controls diverse functions ranging from innate and adaptive immune system activation to vascular development and apoptosis. To analyse the in vivo function of TAK1 in cartilage, we generated mice with a conditional deletion of Tak1 driven by the collagen 2 promoter. Tak1(col2) mice displayed severe chondrodysplasia with runting, impaired formation of secondary centres of ossification, and joint abnormalities including elbow dislocation and tarsal fusion. This phenotype resembled that of bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR)1 and Gdf5-deficient mice. BMPR signalling was markedly impaired in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes as evidenced by reduced expression of known BMP target genes as well as reduced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and p38/Jnk/Erk MAP kinases. TAK1 mediates Smad1 phosphorylation at C-terminal serine residues. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence in a mammalian system that TAK1 is required for BMP signalling and functions as an upstream activating kinase for Smad1/5/8 in addition to its known role in regulating MAP kinase pathways. Our experiments reveal an essential role for TAK1 in the morphogenesis, growth, and maintenance of cartilage.

19686742|t|A prospective cohort study shows unique epigenetic, genetic, and prognostic features of synchronous colorectal cancers.
19686742|a|BACKGROUND     ' AIMS: Synchronous colorectal neoplasias (2 or more primary carcinomas identified in the same patient) are caused by common genetic and environmental factors and can be used to study the field effect. Synchronous colon cancers have not been compared with control solitary cancers in a prospective study. METHODS: We analyzed data collected from 47 patients with synchronous colorectal cancers and 2021 solitary colorectal cancers (controls) in 2 prospective cohort studies. Tumors samples were analyzed for methylation in LINE-1 and 16 CpG islands (CACNA1G, CDKN2A [p16], CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, SOCS1, CHFR, HIC1, IGFBP3, MGMT, MINT1, MINT31, p14 [ARF], and WRN); microsatellite instability (MSI); the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP); 18q loss of heterozygosity; KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations; and expression of beta-catenin, p53, p21, p27, cyclin D1, fatty acid synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2. RESULTS: Compared with patients with solitary colorectal cancer, synchronous colorectal cancer patients had reduced overall survival time (log-rank, P = .0048; hazard ratio [HR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-2.50; P = .0053; multivariate HR, 1.47; 95% CI: 1.00-2.17; P = .049). Compared with solitary tumors, synchronous tumors more frequently contained BRAF mutations (P = .0041), CIMP-high (P = .013), and MSI-high (P = .037). Methylation levels of LINE-1 (Spearman r = 0.82; P = .0072) and CpG island methylation (P    < .0001) correlated between synchronous cancer pairs from the same individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Synchronous colorectal cancers had more frequent mutations in BRAF, were more frequently CIMP- and MSI-high, and had a worse prognosis than solitary colorectal cancers. Similar epigenomic and epigenetic events were frequently observed within a synchronous cancer pair, suggesting the presence of a field defect.

19710510|t|Regulation of Lhb and Egr1 gene expression by GNRH pulses in rat pituitaries is both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)- and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent.
19710510|a|Pulsatile GNRH regulates the gonadotropin subunit genes in a differential manner, with faster frequencies favoring Lhb gene expression and slower frequencies favoring Fshb. Early growth response 1 (EGR1) is critical for Lhb gene transcription. We examined GNRH regulation of EGR1 and its two corepressors, Ngfi-A-binding proteins 1 and 2 (NAB1 and NAB2), both in vivo and in cultured rat pituitary cells. In rats, fast GNRH pulses (every 30 min) stably induced Egr1 primary transcript (PT) and mRNA 2-fold (P    < 0.05) for 1-24 h. In contrast, slow GNRH pulses (every 240 min) increased Egr1 PT at 24 h (6-fold; P    < 0.05) but increased Egr1 mRNA 4- to 5-fold between 4 and 24 h. Both GNRH pulse frequencies increased EGR1 protein 3- to 4-fold. In cultured rat pituitary cells, GNRH pulses (every 60 min) increased Egr1 (PT, 2.5- to 3-fold; mRNA, 1.5- to 2-fold; P    < 0.05). GNRH pulses had little effect on Nab1/2 PT/mRNAs either in vivo or in vitro. We also examined specific intracellular signaling cascades activated by GNRH. Inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/9 (MAPK8/9 [also known as JNK]; SP600125) and MAP Kinase Kinase 1 (MAP2K1 [also known as MEK1]; PD98059) either blunted or totally suppressed the GNRH induction of Lhb PT and Egr1 PT/mRNA, whereas the MAPK14 (also known as p38) inhibitor SB203580 did not. In summary, pulsatile GNRH stimulates Egr1 gene expression and protein in vivo but not in a frequency-dependent manner. Additionally, GNRH-induced Egr1 gene expression is mediated by MAPK8/9 and MAPK1/3, and both are critical for Lhb gene transcription.

19778378|t|U2OS cells lacking Chk1 undergo aberrant mitosis and fail to activate the spindle checkpoint.
19778378|a|Chk1 is a conserved protein kinase originally identified in fission yeast, required to delay entry of cells with damaged or unreplicated DNA into mitosis. The requirement of Chk1 for both S and G2/M checkpoints has been elucidated while only few studies have connected Chk1 to the mitotic spindle checkpoint. We used a small interference RNA strategy to investigate the role of Chk1 in unstressed conditions. Chk1 depletion in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells inhibited cell proliferation and raised the percentage of cells with a 4N DNA content, which correlated with accumulation of giant polynucleated cells morphologically distinct from apoptotic cells, while no increased number of cells in G2 or mitosis could be detected. Down-regulation of Chk1 also caused accumulation of cells in the last step of cytokinesis, and of tetraploid cells in G1 phase, which coincided with activation of p53 and increased levels of p21. In addition, Chk1-depleted U2OS cells failed to arrest in mitosis after spindle disruption by nocodazole and showed decreased protein levels of Mad2 and BubR1. These studies show that U2OS cells lacking Chk1 undergo abnormal mitosis and fail to activate the spindle checkpoint, suggesting a role of Chk1 in this checkpoint.

19789368|t|Vitamin D receptor expression is associated with PIK3CA and KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer.
19789368|a|Vitamin D is associated with decreased risks of various cancers, including colon cancer. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a transcription factor, which plays an important role in cellular differentiation and inhibition of proliferation. A link between VDR and the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway has been suggested. However, the prognostic role of VDR expression or its relationship with PIK3CA or KRAS mutation remains uncertain. Among 619 colorectal cancers in two prospective cohort studies, 233 (38%) tumors showed VDR overexpression by immunohistochemistry. We analyzed for PIK3CA and KRAS mutations and LINE-1 methylation by Pyrosequencing, microsatellite instability (MSI), and DNA methylation (epigenetic changes) in eight CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-specific promoters [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1] by MethyLight (real-time PCR). VDR overexpression was significantly associated with KRAS mutation (odds ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.16) and PIK3CA mutation (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-3.47), both of which persisted in multivariate logistic regression analysis. VDR was not independently associated with body mass index, family history of colorectal cancer, tumor location (colon versus rectum), stage, tumor grade, signet ring cells, CIMP, MSI, LINE-1 hypomethylation, BRAF, p53, p21, beta-catenin, or cyclooxygenase-2. VDR expression was not significantly related with patient survival, prognosis, or clinical outcome. In conclusion, VDR overexpression in colorectal cancer is independently associated with PIK3CA and KRAS mutations. Our data support potential interactions between the VDR, RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, and possible influence by KRAS or PIK3CA mutation on therapy or chemoprevention targeting VDR.

19811499|t|Independent and cooperative roles of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nuclear factor-kappaB, and bone morphogenetic protein-2 in regulation of metastasis and osteomimicry of prostate cancer cells and differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells.
19811499|a|The molecular mechanisms involved in prostate cancer (PC) metastasis and bone remodeling are poorly understood. We recently reported that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) mediates transcriptional regulation and activation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 signaling by nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in bone metastatic prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that NF-kappaB, whether activated by recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or by ectopic expression of the p65 subunit, is involved in extracellular matrix adhesion and invasion of osteotropic PC-3 and C4-2B, but not LNCaP, cells. The enhanced metastatic potential was associated with transcriptional upregulation of osteopontin, osteocalcin, and collagen IA1 in osteotropic PC cells, suggesting their role in osteomimicry of PC cells. Unlike BMP-4, BMP-2 protein enhanced the invasive properties of C4-2B cells, but not in LNCaP cells. Also, this effect was nullified by Noggin. In addition, BMP-2 mediates TNF-alpha-induced invasion of C4-2B cells in a NF-kappaB-dependent fashion. TNF-alpha or conditioned media (CM) of TNF-alpha-stimulated C4-2B cells upregulated BMP-2 and BMP-dependent Smad transcripts and inhibited receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand transcripts in RAW 264.7 preosteoclast cells, respectively, implying that this factor may contribute to suppression of osteoclastogenesis via direct and paracrine mechanisms. In contrast, CM of TNF-alpha-stimulate or BMP2-stimulated C4-2B cells induced in vitro mineralization of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells in a BMP-2-dependent and NF-kappaB-dependent manner, respectively. Taken together, the results suggest that mutual interactions between these factors may be pivotal not only in enhancing the osteomimicry and metastatic potential of PC cells, but also in bone remodeling and in shifting the balance from osteoclastogenesis towards osteoblastogenesis.

19892829|t|The Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex functions in resection-based DNA end joining in Xenopus laevis.
19892829|a|The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential to maintain genomic integrity. In higher eukaryotes, DNA DSBs are predominantly repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), but DNA ends can also be joined by an alternative error-prone mechanism termed microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). In MMEJ, the repair of DNA breaks is mediated by annealing at regions of microhomology and is always associated with deletions at the break site. In budding yeast, the Mre11/Rad5/Xrs2 complex has been demonstrated to play a role in both classical NHEJ and MMEJ, but the involvement of the analogous MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex in end joining in higher eukaryotes is less certain. Here we demonstrate that in Xenopus laevis egg extracts, the MRN complex is not required for classical DNA-PK-dependent NHEJ. However, the XMRN complex is necessary for resection-based end joining of mismatched DNA ends. This XMRN-dependent end joining process is independent of the core NHEJ components Ku70 and DNA-PK, occurs with delayed kinetics relative to classical NHEJ and brings about repair at sites of microhomology. These data indicate a role for the X. laevis MRN complex in MMEJ.

20100334|t|A genetic screen for modifiers of Drosophila caspase Dcp-1 reveals caspase involvement in autophagy and novel caspase-related genes.
20100334|a|BACKGROUND: Caspases are cysteine proteases with essential functions in the apoptotic pathway; their proteolytic activity toward various substrates is associated with the morphological changes of cells. Recent reports have described non-apoptotic functions of caspases, including autophagy. In this report, we searched for novel modifiers of the phenotype of Dcp-1 gain-of-function (GF) animals by screening promoter element- inserted Drosophila melanogaster lines (EP lines). RESULTS: We screened approximately 15,000 EP lines and identified 72 Dcp-1-interacting genes that were classified into 10 groups based on their functions and pathways: 4 apoptosis signaling genes, 10 autophagy genes, 5 insulin/IGF and TOR signaling pathway genes, 6 MAP kinase and JNK signaling pathway genes, 4 ecdysone signaling genes, 6 ubiquitination genes, 11 various developmental signaling genes, 12 transcription factors, 3 translation factors, and 11 other unclassified genes including 5 functionally undefined genes. Among them, insulin/IGF and TOR signaling pathway, MAP kinase and JNK signaling pathway, and ecdysone signaling are known to be involved in autophagy. Together with the identification of autophagy genes, the results of our screen suggest that autophagy counteracts Dcp-1-induced apoptosis. Consistent with this idea, we show that expression of eGFP-Atg5 rescued the eye phenotype caused by Dcp-1 GF. Paradoxically, we found that over-expression of full-length Dcp-1 induced autophagy, as Atg8b-GFP, an indicator of autophagy, was increased in the eye imaginal discs and in the S2 cell line. Taken together, these data suggest that autophagy suppresses Dcp-1-mediated apoptotic cell death, whereas Dcp-1 positively regulates autophagy, possibly through feedback regulation. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a number of Dcp-1 modifiers that genetically interact with Dcp-1-induced cell death. Our results showing that Dcp-1 and autophagy-related genes influence each other will aid future investigations of the complicated relationships between apoptosis and autophagy.

20161747|t|Negative feedback regulation of Wnt4 signaling by EAF1 and EAF2/U19.
20161747|a|Previous studies indicated that EAF (ELL-associated factor) family members, EAF1 and EAF2/U19, play a role in cancer and embryogenesis. For example, EAF2/U19 may serve as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. At the same time, EAF2/U19 is a downstream factor in the non-canonical Wnt 4 signaling pathway required for eye development in Xenopus laevis, and along with EAF1, contributes to convergence and extension movements in zebrafish embryos through Wnt maintenance. Here, we used zebrafish embryos and mammalian cells to show that both EAF1 and EAF2/U19 were up-regulated by Wnt4 (Wnt4a). Furthermore, we found that EAF1 and EAF2/U19 suppressed Wnt4 expression by directly binding to the Wnt4 promoter as seen in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. These findings indicate that an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop occurs between Wnt4 and the EAF family, which is conserved between zebrafish and mammalian. The rescue experiments in zebrafish embryos showed that early embryonic development required the maintenance of the appropriate levels of Wnt4a through the feedback loop. Others have demonstrated that the tumor suppressors p63, p73 and WT1 positively regulate Wnt4 expression while p21 has the opposite effect, suggesting that maintenance of appropriate Wnt4 expression may also be critical for adult tissue homeostasis and prevention against tumor initiation. Thus, the auto-regulatory negative feedback loop that controls expression of Wnt4 and EAF proteins may play an important role in both embryonic development and tumor suppression. Our findings provide the first convincing line of evidence that EAF and Wnt4 form an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop in vivo.

20507572|t|Differential cytokine regulation by NF-kappaB and AP-1 in Jurkat T-cells.
20507572|a|BACKGROUND: Activator protein (AP)-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB largely control T-cell activation, following binding of foreign antigens to the T-cell receptor leading to cytokine secretion. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, IL-6 and CXCL8 are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and AIDS. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the transcription factors, AP-1 and NF-kappaB, in IL-6 and CXCL8 regulation in Jurkat T-cells. RESULTS: Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) exposure resulted in an up-regulation of AP-1 and down-regulation of NF-kappaB activity, however, exposure to heat killed (HK) Escherichia. coli MG1655 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in NF-kappaB activity without affecting AP-1. The cytokine profile revealed an up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL8 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-2 and IL-6 following treatment with both PMA and HK E. coli, while the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were not affected by PMA but were significantly down-regulated by HK E. coli. AP-1 activation was significantly increased 2 h after PMA exposure and continued to increase thereafter. In contrast, NF-kappaB responded to PMA exposure by a rapid up-regulation followed by a subsequent down-regulation. Increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations countered the down-regulation of NF-kappaB by PMA, while similar treatment with calcium ionophore resulted in a reduced NF-kappaB activity following induction with HK E. coli. In order to further study NF-kappaB activation, we considered two up-stream signalling proteins, PKC and Bcl10. Phosphorylated-PKC levels increased in response to PMA and HK E. coli, while Bcl10 levels significantly decreased following PMA treatment. Using an NF-kappaB activation inhibitor, we observed complete inhibition of IL-6 expression while CXCL8 levels only decreased by 40% at the highest concentration. Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA in the presence of JNK-inhibitor suppressed both CXCL8 and IL-6 while PKC-inhibitor primarily decreased CXCL8 expression. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that NF-kappaB regulated IL-6 but not CXCL8. This complex regulation of CXCL8 suggests that there is a need to further evaluate the signalling pathways in order to develop new treatment for diseases with elevated CXCL8 levels, such as AIDS and autoimmune diseases.

20561923|t|Subtilase cytotoxin induces apoptosis in HeLa cells by mitochondrial permeabilization via activation of Bax/Bak, independent of C/EBF-homologue protein (CHOP), Ire1alpha or JNK signaling.
20561923|a|Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB) is an AB(5) cytotoxin produced by some strains of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli. The A subunit is a subtilase-like serine protease and cleaves an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, BiP, leading to transient inhibition of protein synthesis and cell cycle arrest at G(1) phase, and inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis via mitochondrial membrane damage in Vero cells. Here we investigated the mechanism of mitochondrial permeabilization in HeLa cells. SubAB-induced cytochrome c release into cytosol did not depend on mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), since cyclosporine A did not suppress cytochrome c release. SubAB did not change the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL and pro-apoptotic Bax or Bak, but triggered Bax and Bak conformational changes and association of Bax with Bak. Silencing using siRNA of both bax and bak genes, but not bax, bak, or bim alone, resulted in reduction of cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, DNA ladder formation and cytotoxicity, indicating that Bax and Bak were involved in apoptosis. SubAB activated ER transmembrane transducers, Ire1alpha, and cJun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and induced C/EBF-homologue protein (CHOP). To investigate whether these signals were involved in cytochrome c release by Bax activation, we silenced ire1alpha, jnk or chop; however, silencing did not decrease SubAB-induced cytochrome c release, suggesting that these signals were not necessary for SubAB-induced mitochondrial permeabilization by Bax activation.

20644716|t|Themis2/ICB1 is a signaling scaffold that selectively regulates macrophage Toll-like receptor signaling and cytokine production.
20644716|a|BACKGROUND: Thymocyte expressed molecule involved in selection 1 (Themis1, SwissProt accession number Q8BGW0) is the recently characterised founder member of a novel family of proteins. A second member of this family, Themis2 (Q91YX0), also known as ICB1 (Induced on contact with basement membrane 1), remains unreported at the protein level despite microarray and EST databases reporting Themis2 mRNA expression in B cells and macrophages. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we characterise Themis2 protein for the first time and show that it acts as a macrophage signalling scaffold, exerting a receptor-, mediator- and signalling pathway-specific effect on TLR responses in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Themis2 over-expression enhanced the LPS-induced production of TNF but not IL-6 or Cox-2, nor TNF production induced by ligands for TLR2 (PAM3) or TLR3 (poly IratioC). Moreover, LPS-induced activation of the MAP kinases ERK and p38 was enhanced in cells over-expressing Themis2 whereas the activation of JNK, IRF3 or NF-kappaB p65, was unaffected. Depletion of Themis2 protein by RNA inteference inhibited LPS-induced TNF production in primary human macrophages demonstrating a requirement for Themis2 in this event. Themis2 was inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated upon LPS challenge and interacted with Lyn kinase (P25911), the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Vav (P27870), and the adaptor protein Grb2 (Q60631). Mutation of either tyrosine 660 or a proline-rich sequence (PPPRPPK) simultaneously interrupted this complex and reduced by approximately 50% the capacity of Themis2 to promote LPS-induced TNF production. Finally, Themis2 protein expression was induced during macrophage development from murine bone marrow precursors and was regulated by inflammatory stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We hypothesise that Themis2 may constitute a novel, physiological control point in macrophage inflammatory responses.

20813038|t|No evidence of altered alveolar macrophage polarization, but reduced expression of TLR2, in bronchoalveolar lavage cells in sarcoidosis.
20813038|a|BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammatory disease, possibly of infectious aetiology. We aimed to investigate whether the degree of functional polarization of alveolar macrophages (AMs), or Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression, is associated with sarcoidosis or with distinct clinical manifestations of this disease. METHODS: Total BAL cells (cultured four or 24 h in medium, or stimulated 24 h with LPS) from 14 patients and six healthy subjects, sorted AMs from 22 patients (Lofgren's syndrome n = 11) and 11 healthy subjects, and sorted CD4+ T cells from 26 patients (Lofgren's syndrome n = 13) and seven healthy subjects, were included. Using real-time PCR, the relative gene expression of IL-10, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-23p19, CCR2, CCR7, iNOS, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL16, CCL18, CCL20, CD80, and CD86, and innate immune receptors TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9, was quantified in sorted AMs, and for selected genes in total BAL cells, while IL-17A was quantified in T cells. RESULTS: We did not find evidence of a difference with regard to alveolar macrophage M1/M2 polarization between sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls. TLR2 gene expression was significantly lower in sorted AMs from patients, particular in Lofgren's patients. CCL18 gene expression in AMs was significantly higher in patients compared to controls. Additionally, the IL-17A expression was lower in Lofgren's patients' CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was no evidence for alveolar macrophage polarization in sarcoidosis. However, there was a reduced TLR2 mRNA expression in patients with Lofgren's syndrome, which may be of relevance for macrophage interactions with a postulated sarcoidosis pathogen, and for the characteristics of the ensuing T cell response.

20856928|t|Microparticles carrying Sonic hedgehog favor neovascularization through the activation of nitric oxide pathway in mice.
20856928|a|BACKGROUND: Microparticles (MPs) are vesicles released from plasma membrane upon cell activation and during apoptosis. Human T lymphocytes undergoing activation and apoptosis generate MPs bearing morphogen Shh (MPs(Shh+)) that are able to regulate in vitro angiogenesis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we investigated the ability of MPs(Shh+) to modulate neovascularization in a model of mouse hind limb ischemia. Mice were treated in vivo for 21 days with vehicle, MPs(Shh+), MPs(Shh+) plus cyclopamine or cyclopamine alone, an inhibitor of Shh signalling. Laser doppler analysis revealed that the recovery of the blood flow was 1.4 fold higher in MPs(Shh+)-treated mice than in controls, and this was associated with an activation of Shh pathway in muscles and an increase in NO production in both aorta and muscles. MPs(Shh+)-mediated effects on flow recovery and NO production were completely prevented when Shh signalling was inhibited by cyclopamine. In aorta, MPs(Shh+) increased activation of eNOS/Akt pathway, and VEGF expression, being inhibited by cyclopamine. By contrast, in muscles, MPs(Shh+) enhanced eNOS expression and phosphorylation and decreased caveolin-1 expression, but cyclopamine prevented only the effects of MPs(Shh+) on eNOS pathway. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that MPs(Shh+) treatment increased FGF5, FGF2, VEGF A and C mRNA levels and decreased those of alpha5-integrin, FLT-4, HGF, IGF-1, KDR, MCP-1, MT1-MMP, MMP-2, TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, TSP-1 and VCAM-1, in ischemic muscles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that MPs(Shh+) may contribute to reparative neovascularization after ischemic injury by regulating NO pathway and genes involved in angiogenesis.

21075137|t|Phylogenetic and developmental study of CD4, CD8 alpha and beta T cell co-receptor homologs in two amphibian species, Xenopus tropicalis and Xenopus laevis.
21075137|a|CD4 and CD8 co-receptors play critical roles in T cell development and activation by interacting both with T cell receptors and MHC molecules. Although homologs of these genes have been identified in many jawed vertebrates, there are still unresolved gaps concerning their evolution and specialization in MHC interaction and T cell function. Using experimental and computational procedures we identified CD4, CD8alpha and CD8beta gene homologs both in Xenopus tropicalis, whose full genome has been sequenced, and its sister species Xenopus laevis. Multiple alignments of deduced amino acid sequences reveal a poor conservation of the residues involved in binding of CD4 to MHC class II, and CD8alpha to class I in non-mammalian species, presumably related to the co-evolutionary pressure of MHC I and II genes. Phylogenetic study suggests that Xenopodinae co-receptor genes are more closely related to their homologs in other tetrapods than those of bony fish. Furthermore, the developmental and cell-specific expression patterns of these genes in X. laevis are very similar to that of mammals. X. laevis CD4 is mainly expressed by peripheral non-CD8 T cells and detected in the thymus as early as four days post-fertilization (dpf) at the onset of thymic organogenesis. CD8beta expression is specific to adult surface CD8(+) T cells and thymocytes, and is first detected in the thymus at 5 dpf in parallel with productive TCRgamma transrcipts, whereas productive TCRbeta and alpha rearrangements are not detected before 7-9 dpf.

21106074|t|Comparative transcriptome profiling analyses during the lag phase uncover YAP1, PDR1, PDR3, RPN4, and HSF1 as key regulatory genes in genomic adaptation to the lignocellulose derived inhibitor HMF for Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
21106074|a|BACKGROUND: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to adapt and in situ detoxify lignocellulose derived inhibitors such as furfural and HMF. The length of lag phase for cell growth in response to the inhibitor challenge has been used to measure tolerance of strain performance. Mechanisms of yeast tolerance at the genome level remain unknown. Using systems biology approach, this study investigated comparative transcriptome profiling, metabolic profiling, cell growth response, and gene regulatory interactions of yeast strains and selective gene deletion mutations in response to HMF challenges during the lag phase of growth. RESULTS: We identified 365 candidate genes and found at least 3 significant components involving some of these genes that enable yeast adaptation and tolerance to HMF in yeast. First, functional enzyme coding genes such as ARI1, ADH6, ADH7, and OYE3, as well as gene interactions involved in the biotransformation and inhibitor detoxification were the direct driving force to reduce HMF damages in cells. Expressions of these genes were regulated by YAP1 and its closely related regulons. Second, a large number of PDR genes, mainly regulated by PDR1 and PDR3, were induced during the lag phase and the PDR gene family-centered functions, including specific and multiple functions involving cellular transport such as TPO1, TPO4, RSB1, PDR5, PDR15, YOR1, and SNQ2, promoted cellular adaptation and survival in order to cope with the inhibitor stress. Third, expressed genes involving degradation of damaged proteins and protein modifications such as SHP1 and SSA4, regulated by RPN4, HSF1, and other co-regulators, were necessary for yeast cells to survive and adapt the HMF stress. A deletion mutation strain Deltarpn4 was unable to recover the growth in the presence of HMF. CONCLUSIONS: Complex gene interactions and regulatory networks as well as co-regulations exist in yeast adaptation and tolerance to the lignocellulose derived inhibitor HMF. Both induced and repressed genes involving diversified functional categories are accountable for adaptation and energy rebalancing in yeast to survive and adapt the HMF stress during the lag phase of growth. Transcription factor genes YAP1, PDR1, PDR3, RPN4, and HSF1 appeared to play key regulatory rules for global adaptation in the yeast S. cerevisiae.

21124868|t|Localization of a guanylyl cyclase to chemosensory cilia requires the novel ciliary MYND domain protein DAF-25.
21124868|a|In harsh conditions, Caenorhabditis elegans arrests development to enter a non-aging, resistant diapause state called the dauer larva. Olfactory sensation modulates the TGF-beta and insulin signaling pathways to control this developmental decision. Four mutant alleles of daf-25 (abnormal DAuer Formation) were isolated from screens for mutants exhibiting constitutive dauer formation and found to be defective in olfaction. The daf-25 dauer phenotype is suppressed by daf-10/IFT122 mutations (which disrupt ciliogenesis), but not by daf-6/PTCHD3 mutations (which prevent environmental exposure of sensory cilia), implying that DAF-25 functions in the cilia themselves. daf-25 encodes the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian Ankmy2, a MYND domain protein of unknown function. Disruption of DAF-25, which localizes to sensory cilia, produces no apparent cilia structure anomalies, as determined by light and electron microscopy. Hinting at its potential function, the dauer phenotype, epistatic order, and expression profile of daf-25 are similar to daf-11, which encodes a cilium-localized guanylyl cyclase. Indeed, we demonstrate that DAF-25 is required for proper DAF-11 ciliary localization. Furthermore, the functional interaction is evolutionarily conserved, as mouse Ankmy2 interacts with guanylyl cyclase GC1 from ciliary photoreceptors. The interaction may be specific because daf-25 mutants have normally-localized OSM-9/TRPV4, TAX-4/CNGA1, CHE-2/IFT80, CHE-11/IFT140, CHE-13/IFT57, BBS-8, OSM-5/IFT88, and XBX-1/D2LIC in the cilia. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) (required to build cilia) is not defective in daf-25 mutants, although the ciliary localization of DAF-25 itself is influenced in che-11 mutants, which are defective in retrograde IFT. In summary, we have discovered a novel ciliary protein that plays an important role in cGMP signaling by localizing a guanylyl cyclase to the sensory organelle.

21152263|t|Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) signaling in retinoblastoma cells.
21152263|a|Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) - expressed in the developing retina - are known to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in several tumor entities. The objective of this study was to determine the role of the BMP4 pathway in retinoblastoma cells, which are absent in a functional retinoblastoma (RB1) gene. BMP receptors were detected in all retinoblastoma cell lines investigated. A correct transmission of BMP signaling via the Smad1/5/8 pathway could be demonstrated in WERI-Rb1 retinoblastoma cells and application of recombinant human BMP4 resulted in an increase in apoptosis, which to a large extend is caspase independent. Cell proliferation was not affected by BMP4 signaling, although the pRb-related proteins p107 and p130, contributing to the regulation of the same genes, are still expressed. WERI-Rb1 cells exhibit elevated endogenous levels of p21(CIP1) and p53, but we did not detect any increase in p53, p21(CIP1)or p27(KIP1) expression levels. Id proteins became, however, strongly up-regulated upon exogenous BMP4 treatment. Thus, RB1 loss in WERI-Rb1 cells is obviously not compensated for by pRb-independent (e.g. p53-dependent) cell cycle control mechanisms, preventing an anti-proliferative response to BMP4, which normally induces cell cycle arrest.

21668942|t|COX-2 gene expression in colon cancer tissue related to regulating factors and promoter methylation status.
21668942|a|BACKGROUND: Increased cyclooxygenase activity promotes progression of colorectal cancer, but the mechanisms behind COX-2 induction remain elusive. This study was therefore aimed to define external cell signaling and transcription factors relating to high COX-2 expression in colon cancer tissue. METHOD: Tumor and normal colon tissue were collected at primary curative operation in 48 unselected patients. COX-2 expression in tumor and normal colon tissue was quantified including microarray analyses on tumor mRNA accounting for high and low tumor COX-2 expression. Cross hybridization was performed between tumor and normal colon tissue. Methylation status of up-stream COX-2 promoter region was evaluated. RESULTS: Tumors with high COX-2 expression displayed large differences in gene expression compared to normal colon. Numerous genes with altered expression appeared in tumors of high COX-2 expression compared to tumors of low COX-2. COX-2 expression in normal colon was increased in patients with tumors of high COX-2 compared to normal colon from patients with tumors of low COX-2. IL1beta, IL6 and iNOS transcripts were up-regulated among external cell signaling factors; nine transcription factors (ATF3, C/EBP, c-Fos, Fos-B, JDP2, JunB, c-Maf, NF-kappaB, TCF4) showed increased expression and 5 (AP-2, CBP, Elk-1, p53, PEA3) were decreased in tumors with high COX-2. The promoter region of COX-2 gene did not show consistent methylation in tumor or normal colon tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Transcription and external cell signaling factors are altered as covariates to COX-2 expression in colon cancer tissue, but DNA methylation of the COX-2 promoter region was not a significant factor behind COX-2 expression in tumor and normal colon tissue.

21731759|t|Notch, IL-1 and leptin crosstalk outcome (NILCO) is critical for leptin-induced proliferation, migration and VEGF/VEGFR-2 expression in breast cancer.
21731759|a|High levels of pro-angiogenic factors, leptin, IL-1, Notch and VEGF (ligands and receptors), are found in breast cancer, which is commonly correlated with metastasis and lower survival of patients. We have previously reported that leptin induces the growth of breast cancer and the expression of VEGF/VEGFR-2 and IL-1 system. We hypothesized that Notch, IL-1 and leptin crosstalk outcome (NILCO) plays an essential role in the regulation of leptin-mediated induction of proliferation/migration and expression of pro-angiogenic molecules in breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, leptin's effects on the expression and activation of Notch signaling pathway and VEGF/VEGFR-2/IL-1 were determined in mouse (4T1, EMT6 and MMT) breast cancer cells. Remarkably, leptin up-regulated Notch1-4/JAG1/Dll-4, Notch target genes: Hey2 and survivin, together with IL-1 and VEGF/VEGFR-2. RNA knockdown and pharmacological inhibitors of leptin signaling significantly abrogated activity of reporter gene-luciferase CSL (RBP-Jk) promoter, showing that it was linked to leptin-activated JAK2/STAT3, MAPK, PI-3K/mTOR, p38 and JNK signaling pathways. Interestingly, leptin upregulatory effects on cell proliferation/migration and pro-angiogenic factors Notch, IL-1 and VEGF/VEGFR-2 were abrogated by a gamma-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, as well as siRNA against CSL. In addition, blockade of IL-1R tI inhibited leptin-induced Notch, Hey2 and survivin as well as VEGF/VEGFR-2 expression. These data suggest leptin is an inducer of Notch (expression/activation) and IL-1 signaling modulates leptin effects on Notch and VEGF/VEGFR-2. We show for the first time that a novel unveiled crosstalk between Notch, IL-1 and leptin (NILCO) occurs in breast cancer. Leptin induction of proliferation/migration and upregulation of VEGF/VEGFR-2 in breast cancer cells were related to an intact Notch signaling axis. NILCO could represent the integration of developmental, pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic signals critical for leptin-induced cell proliferation/migration and regulation of VEGF/VEGFR-2 in breast cancer. Targeting NILCO might help to design new pharmacological strategies aimed at controlling breast cancer growth and angiogenesis.

21906313|t|Serum leptin levels in relation to circulating cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and angiogenic factors in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia.
21906313|a|OBJECTIVE: In this study, we determined circulating levels of C-reactive protein, several cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and angiogenic factors along with those of leptin in healthy non-pregnant and pregnant women and preeclamptic patients, and investigated whether serum leptin levels were related to the clinical characteristics and measured laboratory parameters of the study participants. METHODS: Sixty preeclamptic patients, 60 healthy pregnant women and 59 healthy non-pregnant women were involved in this case-control study. Levels of leptin and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in maternal sera were assessed by ELISA. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-18, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon-gamma-inducible protein (IP)-10, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 were determined by multiplex suspension array. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were measured by an autoanalyzer. Serum total soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and biologically active placental growth factor (PlGF) levels were determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. For statistical analyses, non-parametric methods were applied. RESULTS: There were significant differences in most of the measured laboratory parameters among the three study groups except for serum IL-1beta and TGF-beta1 levels. Serum leptin levels were significantly higher in preeclamptic patients and healthy pregnant women than in healthy non-pregnant women. Additionally, preeclamptic patients had significantly higher leptin levels as compared to healthy pregnant women. Serum leptin levels were independently associated with BMI in healthy non-pregnant women. In healthy pregnant women, both BMI and serum CRP concentrations showed significant positive linear association with leptin levels. There were significant positive correlations between serum leptin concentrations of healthy pregnant women and systolic blood pressure, as well as serum levels of IP-10, while their serum leptin levels correlated inversely with fetal birth weight. In preeclamptic patients, a significant positive correlation was observed between serum concentrations of leptin and IP-10. Furthermore, elevated serum leptin level and sFlt-1/PlGF ratio had an additive (joint) effect in the risk of preeclampsia, as shown by the substantially higher odds ratios of their combination than of either alone. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous measurement of leptin with several inflammatory molecules and angiogenic factors in this study enabled us to investigate their relationship, which can help to understand the role of circulating leptin in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia.

21931565|t|Release of Ku and MRN from DNA ends by Mre11 nuclease activity and Ctp1 is required for homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks.
21931565|a|The multifunctional Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) protein complex recruits ATM/Tel1 checkpoint kinase and CtIP/Ctp1 homologous recombination (HR) repair factor to double-strand breaks (DSBs). HR repair commences with the 5'-to-3' resection of DNA ends, generating 3' single-strand DNA (ssDNA) overhangs that bind Replication Protein A (RPA) complex, followed by Rad51 recombinase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex is critical for DSB resection, although the enigmatic ssDNA endonuclease activity of Mre11 and the DNA-end processing factor Sae2 (CtIP/Ctp1 ortholog) are largely unnecessary unless the resection activities of Exo1 and Sgs1-Dna2 are also eliminated. Mre11 nuclease activity and Ctp1/CtIP are essential for DSB repair in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mammals. To investigate DNA end resection in Schizo. pombe, we adapted an assay that directly measures ssDNA formation at a defined DSB. We found that Mre11 and Ctp1 are essential for the efficient initiation of resection, consistent with their equally crucial roles in DSB repair. Exo1 is largely responsible for extended resection up to 3.1 kb from a DSB, with an activity dependent on Rqh1 (Sgs1) DNA helicase having a minor role. Despite its critical function in DSB repair, Mre11 nuclease activity is not required for resection in fission yeast. However, Mre11 nuclease and Ctp1 are required to disassociate the MRN complex and the Ku70-Ku80 nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) complex from DSBs, which is required for efficient RPA localization. Eliminating Ku makes Mre11 nuclease activity dispensable for MRN disassociation and RPA localization, while improving repair of a one-ended DSB formed by replication fork collapse. From these data we propose that release of the MRN complex and Ku from DNA ends by Mre11 nuclease activity and Ctp1 is a critical step required to expose ssDNA for RPA localization and ensuing HR repair.

21955513|t|Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing protein 4 (Asb-4) colocalizes with insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4) in the hypothalamic neurons and mediates IRS4 degradation.
21955513|a|BACKGROUND: The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus regulates food intake. Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing protein 4 (Asb-4) is expressed in neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus, target neurons in the regulation of food intake and metabolism by insulin and leptin. However, the target protein(s) of Asb-4 in these neurons remains unknown. Insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4) is an adaptor molecule involved in the signal transduction by both insulin and leptin. In the present study we examined the colocalization and interaction of Asb-4 with IRS4 and the involvement of Asb-4 in insulin signaling. RESULTS: In situ hybridization showed that the expression pattern of Asb-4 was consistent with that of IRS4 in the rat brain. Double in situ hybridization showed that IRS4 colocalized with Asb-4, and both Asb-4 and IRS4 mRNA were expressed in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. In HEK293 cells co-transfected with Myc-tagged Asb-4 and Flag-tagged IRS4, Asb-4 co-immunoprecipitated with IRS4; In these cells endogenous IRS4 also co-immunoprecipitated with transfected Myc-Asb-4; Furthermore, Asb-4 co-immunoprecipitated with IRS4 in rat hypothalamic extracts. In HEK293 cells over expression of Asb-4 decreased IRS4 protein levels and deletion of the SOCS box abolished this effect. Asb-4 increased the ubiquitination of IRS4; Deletion of SOCS box abolished this effect. Expression of Asb-4 decreased both basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated that Asb-4 co-localizes and interacts with IRS4 in hypothalamic neurons. The interaction of Asb-4 with IRS4 in cell lines mediates the degradation of IRS4 and decreases insulin signaling.

22208359|t|Interferon regulatory factor 3 plays an anti-inflammatory role in microglia by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway.
22208359|a|BACKGROUND: Microglia are the principal cells involved in the innate immune response in the CNS. Activated microglia produce a number of proinflammatory cytokines implicated in neurotoxicity but they also are a major source of anti-inflammatory cytokines, antiviral proteins and growth factors. Therefore, an immune therapy aiming at suppressing the proinflammatory phenotype while enhancing the anti-inflammatory, growth promoting phenotype would be of great benefit. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a transcription factor required for the induction of IFNbeta following TLR3 or TLR4 activation, is critical to the microglial phenotype change from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory, and that this phenotype change can be greatly facilitated by IRF3 gene transfer. METHODS: Cultures of primary human fetal microglia were transduced with IRF3 using recombinant adenovirus (Ad-IRF3) and subjected to microarray analysis, real-time PCR, immunoblotting and ELISA to determine inflammatory gene expression. Two different types of immune stimuli were tested, the TLR ligands, poly IC (PIC) and LPS, and the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1/IFNgamma. In addition, the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway was examined by use of a pharmacological inhibitor, LY294002. RESULTS: Our results show that Ad-IRF3 suppressed proinflammatory genes (IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-8 and CXCL1) and enhanced anti-inflammatory genes (IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-10 and IFNbeta) in microglia, regardless of the cell stimuli applied. Furthermore, Ad-IRF3 activated Akt, and LY294002 reversed the effects of Ad-IRF3 on microglial inflammatory gene expression. pAkt was critical in LPS- or PIC-induced production of IL-10 and IL-1ra. Significantly, microglial IFNbeta protein production was also dependent on pAkt and required both Ad-IRF3 and immunological stimuli (PIC    > IL-1/IFNgamma). pAkt played much less prominent and variable roles in microglial proinflammatory gene expression. This anti-inflammatory promoting role of PI3K/Akt appeared to be specific to microglia, since astrocyte proinflammatory gene expression (as well as IFNbeta expression) required PI3K/Akt. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a novel anti-inflammatory role for the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in microglia. They further suggest that IRF3 gene therapy could facilitate the microglial phenotype switch from proinflammatory ("M1-like") to anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory ("M2-like"), in part, by augmenting the level of pAkt.

22369755|t|Reciprocal effects of NNK and SLURP-1 on oncogene expression in target epithelial cells.
22369755|a|AIMS: To elucidate how the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed on bronchial and oral epithelial cells targeted by the tobacco nitrosamine (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) (NNK) facilitate carcinogenic transformation. MAIN METHODS: Since NNK-dependent transformation can be abolished by the nicotinergic secreted mammalian Ly-6/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1 (SLURP-1), we compared effects of NNK and recombinant (r)SLURP-1 on the expression of genes related to tumorigenesis in human immortalized bronchial and oral epithelial cell lines BEP2D and Het-1A, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: NNK stimulated expression of oncogenic genes, including MYB and PIK3CA in BEP2D, ETS1, NRAS and SRC in Het-1A, and AKT1, KIT and RB1 in both cell types, which could be abolished in the presence of rSLURP-1. Other cancer-related genes whose upregulation by NNK was abolishable by rSLURP-1 were the growth factors EGF in BEP2D cells and HGF in Het-1A cells, and the transcription factors CDKN2A and STAT3 (Het-1A only). NNK also upregulated the anti-apoptotic BCL2 (Het-1A) and downregulated the pro-apoptotic TNF (Het-1A), BAX and CASP8 (BEP2D), all of which could be abolished, in part, by rSLURP-1. NNK decreased expression of the CTNNB1 gene encoding the intercellular adhesion molecule beta-catenin (BEP2D), as well as tumor suppressors CDKN3 and FOXD3 in BEP2D cells and SERPINB5 in Het-1A cells. These pro-oncogenic effects of NNK were abolished by rSLURP-1 that also upregulated RUNX3. SIGNIFICANCE: The obtained results identified target genes for both NNK and SLURP-1 and shed light on the molecular mechanism of their reciprocal effects on tumorigenic transformation of bronchial and oral epithelial cells.

22711886|t|TNFR-associated factor 2 deficiency in B lymphocytes predisposes to chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma in mice.
22711886|a|We have previously shown that transgenic (tg) mice expressing in B lymphocytes both BCL-2 and a TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) mutant lacking the really interesting new gene and zinc finger domains (TRAF2DN) develop small lymphocytic lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia with high incidence (Zapata et al. 2004. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 101: 16600-16605). Further analysis of the expression of TRAF2 and TRAF2DN in purified B cells demonstrated that expression of both endogenous TRAF2 and tg TRAF2DN was negligible in Traf2DN-tg B cells compared with wild-type mice. This was the result of proteasome-dependent degradation, and rendered TRAF2DN B cells as bona fide TRAF2-deficient B cells. Similar to B cells with targeted Traf2 deletion, Traf2DN-tg mice show expanded marginal zone B cell population and have constitutive p100 NF-kappaB2 processing. Also, TRAF3, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and Bcl-X(L) expression levels were increased, whereas cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 and 2 levels were drastically reduced compared with those found in wild-type B cells. Moreover, consistent with previous results, we also show that TRAF2 was required for efficient JNK and ERK activation in response to CD40 engagement. However, TRAF2 was deleterious for BCR-mediated activation of these kinases. In contrast, TRAF2 deficiency had no effect on CD40-mediated p38 MAPK activation but significantly reduced BCR-mediated p38 activation. Finally, we further confirm that TRAF2 was required for CD40-mediated proliferation, but its absence relieved B cells of the need for B cell activating factor for survival. Altogether, our results suggest that TRAF2 deficiency cooperates with BCL-2 in promoting chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma in mice, possibly by specifically enforcing marginal zone B cell accumulation, increasing X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis expression, and rendering B cells independent of B cell activating factor for survival.

22808010|t|Defining an EPOR- regulated transcriptome for primary progenitors, including Tnfr-sf13c as a novel mediator of EPO- dependent erythroblast formation.
22808010|a|Certain concepts concerning EPO/EPOR action modes have been challenged by in vivo studies: Bcl-x levels are elevated in maturing erythroblasts, but not in their progenitors; truncated EPOR alleles that lack a major p85/PI3K recruitment site nonetheless promote polycythemia; and Erk1 disruption unexpectedly bolsters erythropoiesis. To discover novel EPO/EPOR action routes, global transcriptome analyses presently are applied to interrogate EPO/EPOR effects on primary bone marrow-derived CFUe-like progenitors. Overall, 160 EPO/EPOR target transcripts were significantly modulated 2-to 21.8-fold. A unique set of EPO-regulated survival factors included Lyl1, Gas5, Pim3, Pim1, Bim, Trib3 and Serpina 3g. EPO/EPOR-modulated cell cycle mediators included Cdc25a, Btg3, Cyclin-d2, p27-kip1, Cyclin-g2 and CyclinB1-IP-1. EPO regulation of signal transduction factors was also interestingly complex. For example, not only Socs3 plus Socs2 but also Spred2, Spred1 and Eaf1 were EPO-induced as negative-feedback components. Socs2, plus five additional targets, further proved to comprise new EPOR/Jak2/Stat5 response genes (which are important for erythropoiesis during anemia). Among receptors, an atypical TNF-receptor Tnfr-sf13c was up-modulated    >5-fold by EPO. Functionally, Tnfr-sf13c ligation proved to both promote proerythroblast survival, and substantially enhance erythroblast formation. The EPOR therefore engages a sophisticated set of transcriptome response circuits, with Tnfr-sf13c deployed as one novel positive regulator of proerythroblast formation.

22859398|t|Variation in IL10 and other genes involved in the immune response and in oxidation and prostate cancer recurrence.
22859398|a|BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association of variation in genes involved in immune response, including IL10, production and detoxification of reactive oxygen species, and repair of oxidative DNA damage with risk of recurrence after surgery for localized prostate cancer. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of men who had a radical prostatectomy in 1993 to 2001. A total of 484 recurrence cases and 484 controls were matched on age, race, and pathologic stage and grade. Germline DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded unaffected lymph nodes. We genotyped candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in IL10, CRP, GPX1, GSR, GSTP1, hOGG1, IL1B, IL1RN, IL6, IL8, MPO, NOS2, NOS3, SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, TLR4, and TNF and tagging SNPs in IL10, CRP, GSR, IL1RN, IL6, NOS2, and NOS3. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate OR and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The minor allele (A) in IL10 rs1800872, known to produce less interleukin-10 (IL-10), was associated with a higher risk of recurrence (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.00-3.10), and the minor allele (G) in rs1800896, known to produce more IL-10, was associated with a lower risk of recurrence (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.91). We also observed associations for candidate SNPs in CRP, GSTP1, and IL1B. A common IL10 haplotype and 2 common NOS2 haplotypes were associated with recurrence. CONCLUSION: Variation in IL10, CRP, GSTP1, IL1B, and NOS2 was associated with prostate cancer recurrence independent of pathologic prognostic factors. IMPACT: This study supports that genetic variation in immune response and oxidation influence prostate cancer recurrence risk and suggests genetic variation in these pathways may inform prognosis.

22876196|t|Minibrain/Dyrk1a regulates food intake through the Sir2-FOXO-sNPF/NPY pathway in Drosophila and mammals.
22876196|a|Feeding behavior is one of the most essential activities in animals, which is tightly regulated by neuroendocrine factors. Drosophila melanogaster short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and the mammalian functional homolog neuropeptide Y (NPY) regulate food intake. Understanding the molecular mechanism of sNPF and NPY signaling is critical to elucidate feeding regulation. Here, we found that minibrain (mnb) and the mammalian ortholog Dyrk1a, target genes of sNPF and NPY signaling, [corrected] regulate food intake in Drosophila melanogaster and mice. In Drosophila melanogaster neuronal cells and mouse hypothalamic cells, sNPF and NPY modulated the mnb and Dyrk1a expression through the PKA-CREB pathway. Increased Dyrk1a activated Sirt1 to regulate the deacetylation of FOXO, which potentiated FOXO-induced sNPF/NPY expression and in turn promoted food intake. Conversely, AKT-mediated insulin signaling suppressed FOXO-mediated sNPF/NPY expression, which resulted in decreasing food intake. Furthermore, human Dyrk1a transgenic mice exhibited decreased FOXO acetylation and increased NPY expression in the hypothalamus, and [corrected] increased food intake. Our findings demonstrate that Mnb/Dyrk1a regulates food intake through the evolutionary conserved Sir2-FOXO-sNPF/NPY pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals.

22925925|t|SOCS3 deficiency promotes M1 macrophage polarization and inflammation.
22925925|a|Macrophages participate in both the amplification of inflammation at the time of injury and downregulation of the inflammatory response to avoid excess tissue damage. These divergent functions of macrophages are dictated by their microenvironment, especially cytokines, which promote a spectrum of macrophage phenotypes. The M1 proinflammatory phenotype is induced by LPS, IFN-gamma, and GM-CSF, and IL-4, IL-13, and M-CSF induce anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins function as feedback inhibitors of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, and they can terminate innate and adaptive immune responses. In this study, we have evaluated the influence of SOCS3 on macrophage polarization and function. Macrophages obtained from LysMCre-SOCS3(fl/fl) mice, which lack SOCS3 in myeloid lineage cells, exhibit enhanced and prolonged activation of the JAK/STAT pathway compared with macrophages from SOCS3(fl/fl) mice. Furthermore, SOCS3-deficient macrophages have higher levels of the M1 genes IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and inducible NO synthase owing to enhanced transcriptional activation and chromatin modifications. SOCS3-deficient M1 macrophages also have a stronger capacity to induce Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation than M1 macrophages from SOCS3(fl/fl) mice. Lastly, LPS-induced sepsis is exacerbated in LysMCre-SOCS3(fl/fl) mice and is associated with enhanced STAT1/3 activation and increased plasma levels of M1 cytokines/chemokines such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL11. These findings collectively indicate that SOCS3 is involved in repressing the M1 proinflammatory phenotype, thereby deactivating inflammatory responses in macrophages.

22964642|t|Nrf2 is controlled by two distinct beta-TrCP recognition motifs in its Neh6 domain, one of which can be modulated by GSK-3 activity.
22964642|a|Identification of regulatable mechanisms by which transcription factor NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is repressed will allow strategies to be designed that counter drug resistance associated with its upregulation in tumours that harbour somatic mutations in Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1), a gene that encodes a joint adaptor and substrate receptor for the Cul3-Rbx1/Roc1 ubiquitin ligase. We now show that mouse Nrf2 contains two binding sites for beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TrCP), which acts as a substrate receptor for the Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1/Roc1 ubiquitin ligase complex. Deletion of either binding site in Nrf2 decreased beta-TrCP-mediated ubiquitylation of the transcription factor. The ability of one of the two beta-TrCP-binding sites to serve as a degron could be both increased and decreased by manipulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity. Biotinylated-peptide pull-down assays identified DSGIS(338) and DSAPGS(378) as the two beta-TrCP-binding motifs in Nrf2. Significantly, our pull-down assays indicated that beta-TrCP binds a phosphorylated version of DSGIS more tightly than its non-phosphorylated counterpart, whereas this was not the case for DSAPGS. These data suggest that DSGIS, but not DSAPGS, contains a functional GSK-3 phosphorylation site. Activation of GSK-3 in Keap1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), or in human lung A549 cells that contain mutant Keap1, by inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt pathway markedly reduced endogenous Nrf2 protein and decreased to 10-50% of normal the levels of mRNA for prototypic Nrf2-regulated enzymes, including the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic and modifier subunits, glutathione S-transferases Alpha-1 and Mu-1, haem oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1. Pre-treatment of Keap1(-/-) MEFs or A549 cells with the LY294002 PI3K inhibitor or the MK-2206 PKB/Akt inhibitor increased their sensitivity to acrolein, chlorambucil and cisplatin between 1.9-fold and 3.1-fold, and this was substantially attenuated by simultaneous pre-treatment with the GSK-3 inhibitor CT99021.

23285048|t|Context- and cell-dependent effects of Delta-like 4 targeting in the bone marrow microenvironment.
23285048|a|Delta-like 4 (Dll4) is a ligand of the Notch pathway family which has been widely studied in the context of tumor angiogenesis, its blockade shown to result in non-productive angiogenesis and halted tumor growth. As Dll4 inhibitors enter the clinic, there is an emerging need to understand their side effects, namely the systemic consequences of Dll4:Notch blockade in tissues other than tumors. The present study focused on the effects of systemic anti-Dll4 targeting in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Here we show that Dll4 blockade with monoclonal antibodies perturbs the BM vascular niche of sub-lethally irradiated mice, resulting in increased CD31(+), VE-Cadherin(+) and c-kit(+) vessel density, and also increased megakaryocytes, whereas CD105(+), VEGFR3(+), SMA(+) and lectin(+) vessel density remained unaltered. We investigated also the expression of angiocrine genes upon Dll4 treatment in vivo, and demonstrate that IGFbp2, IGFbp3, Angpt2, Dll4, DHH and VEGF-A are upregulated, while FGF1 and CSF2 are reduced. In vitro treatment of endothelial cells with anti-Dll4 reduced Akt phosphorylation while maintaining similar levels of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation. Besides its effects in the BM vascular niche, anti-Dll4 treatment perturbed hematopoiesis, as evidenced by increased myeloid (CD11b(+)), decreased B (B220(+)) and T (CD3(+)) lymphoid BM content of treated mice, with a corresponding increase in myeloid circulating cells. Moreover, anti-Dll4 treatment also increased the number of CFU-M and -G colonies in methylcellulose assays, independently of Notch1. Finally, anti-Dll4 treatment of donor BM improved the hematopoietic recovery of lethally irradiated recipients in a transplant setting. Together, our data reveals the hematopoietic (BM) effects of systemic anti-Dll4 treatment result from qualitative vascular changes and also direct hematopoietic cell modulation, which may be favorable in a transplant setting.

23359500|t|Keratinocyte overexpression of IL-17C promotes psoriasiform skin inflammation.
23359500|a|IL-17C is a functionally distinct member of the IL-17 family that binds IL-17 receptor E/A to promote innate defense in epithelial cells and regulate Th17 cell differentiation. We demonstrate that IL-17C (not IL-17A) is the most abundant IL-17 isoform in lesional psoriasis skin (1058 versus 8 pg/ml; p    < 0.006) and localizes to keratinocytes (KCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and leukocytes. ECs stimulated with IL-17C produce increased TNF-alpha and KCs stimulated with IL-17C/TNF-alpha produce similar inflammatory gene response patterns as those elicited by IL-17A/TNF-alpha, including increases in IL-17C, TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-1alpha/beta, IL-1F5, IL-1F9, IL-6, IL-19, CCL20, S100A7/A8/A9, DEFB4, lipocalin 2, and peptidase inhibitor 3 (p    < 0.05), indicating a positive proinflammatory feedback loop between the epidermis and ECs. Psoriasis patients treated with etanercept rapidly decrease cutaneous IL-17C levels, suggesting IL-17C/TNF-alpha-mediated inflammatory signaling is critical for psoriasis pathogenesis. Mice genetically engineered to overexpress IL-17C in KCs develop well-demarcated areas of erythematous, flakey involved skin adjacent to areas of normal-appearing uninvolved skin despite increased IL-17C expression in both areas (p    < 0.05). Uninvolved skin displays increased angiogenesis and elevated S100A8/A9 expression (p    < 0.05) but no epidermal hyperplasia, whereas involved skin exhibits robust epidermal hyperplasia, increased angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltration, and upregulated TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha/beta, IL-17A/F, IL-23p19, vascular endothelial growth factor, IL-6, and CCL20 (p    < 0.05), suggesting that IL-17C, when coupled with other proinflammatory signals, initiates the development of psoriasiform dermatitis. This skin phenotype was significantly improved following 8 wk of TNF-alpha inhibition. These findings identify a role for IL-17C in skin inflammation and suggest a pathogenic function for the elevated IL-17C observed in lesional psoriasis skin.

23474308|t|Chronic Akt activation attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced cardiac dysfunction via Akt/GSK3beta-dependent inhibition of apoptosis and ER stress.
23474308|a|Sepsis is characterized by systematic inflammation and contributes to cardiac dysfunction. This study was designed to examine the effect of protein kinase B (Akt) activation on lipopolysaccharide-induced cardiac anomalies and underlying mechanism(s) involved. Mechanical and intracellular Ca2+ properties were examined in myocardium from wild-type and transgenic mice with cardiac-specific chronic Akt overexpression following LPS (4 mg/kg, i.p.) challenge. Akt signaling cascade (Akt, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta), stress signal (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p38), apoptotic markers (Bcl-2 associated X protein, caspase-3/-9), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (glucose-regulated protein 78, growth arrest and DNA damage induced gene-153, eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha), inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6) and autophagic markers (Beclin-1, light chain 3B, autophagy-related gene 7 and sequestosome 1) were evaluated. Our results revealed that LPS induced marked decrease in ejection fraction, fractional shortening, cardiomyocyte contractile capacity with dampened intracellular Ca2+ release and clearance, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and decreased glutathione and glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratio, increased ERK, JNK, p38, GRP78, Gadd153, eIF2alpha, BAX, caspase-3 and -9, downregulated B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), the effects of which were significantly attenuated or obliterated by Akt activation. Akt activation itself did not affect cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca2+ properties, ROS production, oxidative stress, apoptosis and ER stress. In addition, LPS upregulated levels of Beclin-1, LC3B and Atg7, while suppressing p62 accumulation. Akt activation did not affect Beclin-1, LC3B, Atg7 and p62 in the presence or absence of LPS. Akt overexpression promoted phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta. In vitro study using the GSK3beta inhibitor SB216763 mimicked the response elicited by chronic Akt activation. Taken together, these data showed that Akt activation ameliorated LPS-induced cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca2+ anomalies through inhibition of apoptosis and ER stress, possibly involving an Akt/GSK3beta-dependent mechanism.

23640975|t|PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502 antitumor activity is enhanced with induction of wild-type TP53 in human xenograft and murine knockout models of head and neck cancer.
23640975|a|PURPOSE: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation is often associated with altered expression or mutations of PIK3CA, TP53/p73, PTEN, and TGF-beta receptors (TGFBR) in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). However, little is known about how these alterations affect response to PI3K/mTOR-targeted agents. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this preclinical study, PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling was characterized in nine HNSCC (UM-SCC) cell lines and human oral keratinocytes. We investigated the molecular and anticancer effects of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502(PF-502) in UM-SCC expressing PIK3CA with decreased wild-type TP53, mutant TP53-/+ mutantTGFBR2, and in HNSCC of a conditional Pten/Tgfbr1 double knockout mouse model displaying PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation. RESULTS: UM-SCC showed increased PIK3CA expression and Akt/mTOR activation, and PF-502 inhibited PI3K/mTORC1/2 targets. In human HNSCC expressing PIK3CA and decreased wtTP53 and p73, PF-502 reciprocally enhanced TP53/p73 expression and growth inhibition, which was partially reversible by p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha. Most UM-SCC with wtTP53 exhibited a lower IC50 than those with mtTP53 status. PF-502 blocked growth in G0-G1 and increased apoptotic sub-G0 DNA. PF-502 suppressed tumorigenesis and showed combinatorial activity with radiation in a wild-type TP53 UM-SCC xenograft model. PF-502 also significantly delayed HNSCC tumorigenesis and prolonged survival of Pten/Tgfbr1-deficient mice. Significant inhibition of p-Akt, p-4EBP1, p-S6, and Ki67, as well as increased p53 and TUNEL were observed in tumor specimens. CONCLUSIONS: PI3K-mTOR inhibition can enhance TP53/p73 expression and significantly inhibit tumor growth alone or when combined with radiation in HNSCC with wild-type TP53. PIK3CA, TP53/p73, PTEN, and TGF-beta alterations are potential modifiers of response and merit investigation in future clinical trials with PI3K-mTOR inhibitors.

23651211|t|Upregulation of T-cell factor-4 isoform-responsive target genes in hepatocellular carcinoma.
23651211|a|BACKGROUND: The Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion through regulation by T-cell factor (TCF)-4 transcription factor proteins. However, the role of TCF-4 isoforms generated by alternative splicing events in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. AIM: Here, we investigated TCF-4 isoforms (TCF-4J and K)-responsive target genes that are important in hepatic oncogenesis and tumour development. METHODS: Gene expression microarray was performed on HCC cells overexpressing TCF-4J and K isoforms. Expression level of selected target genes was evaluated and correlations were made between their expression level and that of TCF-4 isoform in 47 pairs of human HCC tumours. RESULTS: Comparison by gene expression microarray revealed that 447 genes were upregulated and 343 downregulated more than 2.0-fold in TCF-4J compared with TCF-4K expressing cells. We validated expression of 18 selected target genes involved in Wnt/beta-catenin, insulin/IGF-1/IRS1 and Notch signalling pathways in 47 pairs of human HCCs and adjacent uninvolved liver tissues. It was observed that 13 genes (CLDN2, STK17B, SPP1, AXIN2, WISP2, MMP7, IRS1, ANXA1, CAMK2N1, ASPH, GPR56, CD24 and JAG1) activated by TCF-4J isoform in HCC cells, were also upregulated in HCC tumours compared with adjacent peritumour tissue; more importantly, 10 genes exhibited a significant correlation with the TCF-4J expression level in tumour. CONCLUSION: TCF-4 isoforms (TCF-4J and K) activated different downstream target genes in HCC. The biological consequence of TCF-4J isoform expression was upregulation of genes associated with tripartite Wnt/beta-catenin, insulin/IGF-1/IRS1 and Notch signal transduction pathway activation, which contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC.

23762492|t|The eta7/csn3-3 auxin response mutant of Arabidopsis defines a novel function for the CSN3 subunit of the COP9 signalosome.
23762492|a|The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is an eight subunit protein complex conserved in all higher eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the CSN regulates auxin response by removing the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8/RUB1 from the CUL1 subunit of the SCF(TIR1/AFB) ubiquitin-ligase (deneddylation). Previously described null mutations in any CSN subunit result in the pleiotropic cop/det/fus phenotype and cause seedling lethality, hampering the study of CSN functions in plant development. In a genetic screen to identify enhancers of the auxin response defects conferred by the tir1-1 mutation, we identified a viable csn mutant of subunit 3 (CSN3), designated eta7/csn3-3. In addition to enhancing tir1-1 mutant phenotypes, the csn3-3 mutation alone confers several phenotypes indicative of impaired auxin signaling including auxin resistant root growth and diminished auxin responsive gene expression. Unexpectedly however, csn3-3 plants are not defective in either the CSN-mediated deneddylation of CUL1 or in SCF(TIR1)-mediated degradation of Aux/IAA proteins. These findings suggest that csn3-3 is an atypical csn mutant that defines a novel CSN or CSN3-specific function. Consistent with this possibility, we observe dramatic differences in double mutant interactions between csn3-3 and other auxin signaling mutants compared to another weak csn mutant, csn1-10. Lastly, unlike other csn mutants, assembly of the CSN holocomplex is unaffected in csn3-3 plants. However, we detected a small CSN3-containing protein complex that is altered in csn3-3 plants. We hypothesize that in addition to its role in the CSN as a cullin deneddylase, CSN3 functions in a distinct protein complex that is required for proper auxin signaling.

23936147|t|Downregulation of steroid receptor coactivator-2 modulates estrogen-responsive genes and stimulates proliferation of mcf-7 breast cancer cells.
23936147|a|The p160/Steroid Receptor Coactivators SRC-1, SRC-2/GRIP1, and SRC-3/AIB1 are important regulators of Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERalpha) activity. However, whereas the functions of SRC-1 and SRC-3 in breast tumourigenesis have been extensively studied, little is known about the role of SRC-2. Previously, we reported that activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA, facilitates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of SRC-2 which in turn leads to inhibition of SRC-2-coactivation of ERalpha and changed expression of the ERalpha target gene, pS2. Here we have characterized the global program of transcription in SRC-2-depleted MCF-7 breast cancer cells using short-hairpin RNA technology, and in MCF-7 cells exposed to PKA activating agents. In order to identify genes that may be regulated through PKA-induced downregulation of SRC-2, overlapping transcriptional targets in response to the respective treatments were characterized. Interestingly, we observed decreased expression of several breast cancer tumour suppressor genes (e.g., TAGLN, EGR1, BCL11b, CAV1) in response to both SRC-2 knockdown and PKA activation, whereas the expression of a number of other genes implicated in cancer progression (e.g., RET, BCAS1, TFF3, CXCR4, ADM) was increased. In line with this, knockdown of SRC-2 also stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Together, these results suggest that SRC-2 may have an antiproliferative function in breast cancer cells.

24004819|t|Mammary carcinoma cell derived cyclooxygenase 2 suppresses tumor immune surveillance by enhancing intratumoral immune checkpoint activity.
24004819|a|INTRODUCTION: Systemic inhibition of the inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 decreases the risk of breast cancer and its recurrence. However, the biology of COX-2 in the multicellular tumor microenvironment is poorly defined. METHODS: Mammary tumor onset and multiplicity were examined in ErbB2 transgenic mice that were deficient in mammary epithelial cell COX-2 (COX-2(MEC)KO) compared to wild type (WT) mice. Tumors were analyzed, by real time PCR, immune-staining and flow cytometry, for proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and immune microenvironment. Lentiviral shRNA delivery was used to knock down (KD) COX-2 in ErbB2-transformed mouse breast cancer cells (COX-2KD), and growth as orthotopic tumors was examined in syngenic recipient mice, with or without depletion of CD8+ immune cells. RESULTS: Mammary tumor onset was delayed, and multiplicity halved, in COX-2(MEC)KO mice compared to WT. COX-2(MEC)KO tumors showed decreased expression of Ki67, a proliferation marker, as well as reduced VEGFA, its receptor VEGFR2, endothelial NOS and the vascular endothelial marker CD31, indicating reduced tumor vascularization. COX-2(MEC)KO tumors contained more CD4+ T helper (Th) cells and CD8+ cytotoxic immune cells (CTL) consistent with increased immune surveillance. The ratio of Th markers Tbet (Th1) to GATA3 (Th2) was higher, and levels of Retnla, a M2 macrophage marker, lower, in COX-2(MEC)KO tumor infiltrating leukocytes compared to WT, suggesting a prevalence of pro-immune Th1 over immune suppressive Th2 lymphocytes, and reduced macrophage polarization to the immune suppressive M2 phenotype. Enhanced immune surveillance in COX-2(MEC)KO tumors was coincident with increased intratumoral CXCL9, a T cell chemoattractant, and decreased expression of T lymphocyte co-inhibitory receptors CTLA4 and PD-1, as well as PD-L1, the ligand for PD-1. PD-L1 was also decreased in IFNgamma-treated COX-2KD mouse mammary cancer cells in vitro and, compared to control cells, growth of COX-2KD cells as orthotopic tumors in immune competent mice was markedly suppressed. However, robust growth of COX-2KD tumor cells was evident when recipients were depleted of CD8+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: The data strongly support that, in addition to its angiogenic function, tumor cell COX-2 suppresses intratumoral cytotoxic CD8+ immune cell function, possibly through upregulation of immune checkpoints, thereby contributing to tumor immune escape. COX-2 inhibition may be clinically useful to augment breast cancer immunotherapy.

24142921|t|Identification and characterization of FGF2-dependent mRNA: microRNA networks during lens fiber cell differentiation.
24142921|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling regulate a wide range of cellular functions, including cell specification, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival. In lens, both these systems control lens fiber cell differentiation; however, a possible link between these processes remains to be examined. Herein, the functional requirement for miRNAs in differentiating lens fiber cells was demonstrated via conditional inactivation of Dicer1 in mouse (Mus musculus) lens. To dissect the miRNA-dependent pathways during lens differentiation, we used a rat (Rattus norvegicus) lens epithelial explant system, induced by FGF2 to differentiate, followed by mRNA and miRNA expression profiling. Transcriptome and miRNome analysis identified extensive FGF2-regulated cellular responses that were both independent and dependent on miRNAs. We identified 131 FGF2-regulated miRNAs. Seventy-six of these miRNAs had at least two in silico predicted and inversely regulated target mRNAs. Genes modulated by the greatest number of FGF-regulated miRNAs include DNA-binding transcription factors Nfib, Nfat5/OREBP, c-Maf, Ets1, and N-Myc. Activated FGF signaling influenced bone morphogenetic factor/transforming growth factor-beta, Notch, and Wnt signaling cascades implicated earlier in lens differentiation. Specific miRNA:mRNA interaction networks were predicted for c-Maf, N-Myc, and Nfib (DNA-binding transcription factors); Cnot6, Cpsf6, Dicer1, and Tnrc6b (RNA to miRNA processing); and Ash1l, Med1/PBP, and Kdm5b/Jarid1b/Plu1 (chromatin remodeling). Three miRNAs, including miR-143, miR-155, and miR-301a, down-regulated expression of c-Maf in the 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assays. These present studies demonstrate for the first time global impact of activated FGF signaling in lens cell culture system and predicted novel gene regulatory networks connected by multiple miRNAs that regulate lens differentiation.

24204098|t|STAT3 regulates proliferation and survival of CD8+ T cells: enhances effector responses to HSV-1 infection, and inhibits IL-10+ regulatory CD8+ T cells in autoimmune uveitis.
24204098|a|STAT3 regulates CD4+ T cell survival and differentiation. However, its effects on CD8+ T cells are not well understood. Here, we show that in comparison to WT CD8+ T cells, STAT3-deficient CD8+ T cells exhibit a preactivated memory-like phenotype, produce more IL-2, proliferate faster, and are more sensitive to activation-induced cell death (AICD). The enhanced proliferation and sensitivity to AICD correlated with downregulation of class-O forkhead transcription factors (FoxO1, FoxO3A), p21(waf1), p27(KIP1), Bcl-2, OX-40, and upregulation of FasL, Bax, and Bad. We examined whether STAT3-deficient CD8+ T cells can mount effective response during herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) infection and experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Compared to WT mice, HSV-1-infected STAT3-deficient mice (STAT3KO) produced less IFN-gamma and virus-specific KLRG-1+ CD8+ T cells. STAT3KO mice are also resistant to EAU and produced less IL-17-producing Tc17 cells. Resistance of STAT3KO to EAU correlated with marked expansion of IL-10-producing regulatory CD8+ T cells (CD8-Treg) implicated in recovery from autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Thus, increases of IL-6-induced STAT3 activation observed during inflammation may inhibit expansion of CD8-Tregs, thereby impeding recovery from uveitis. These results suggest that STAT3 is a potential therapeutic target for upregulating CD8+ T cell-mediated responses to viruses and suggest the successful therapeutic targeting of STAT3 as treatment for uveitis, derived, in part, from promoting CD8-Treg expansion.

24396288|t|Human hepatic progenitor cells express hematopoietic cell markers CD45 and CD109.
24396288|a|OBJECTIVE: To clarify the precise characteristics of human hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) for future cytotherapy in liver diseases. METHODS: Hepatic progenitor-like cells were isolated and cultured from the livers of patients who had undergone partial hepatectomy for various pathologies but displayed no sign of hepatic dysfunction. These cells were characterized by transcriptomic profiling, quantitative real-time PCR and immunocyto/histochemistry. RESULTS: Cultured HPCs contained polygonal, high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and exhibited a global gene expression profile similar (67.8%) to that of primary hepatocytes. Among the genes with more than 20-fold higher expression in HPCs were a progenitor marker (CD90), a pentraxin-related gene (PTX3), collagen proteins (COL5A2, COL1A1 and COL4A2), cytokines (EGF and PDGFD), metabolic enzymes (CYBRD1, BCAT1, TIMP2 and PAM), a secreted protein (SPARC) and an endothelial protein C receptor (PROCR). Moreover, eight markers (ALB, AFP, CK8, CK18, CK19, CD90, CD117 and Oval-6) previously described as HPC markers were validated by qRT-PCR and/or immunocyto/histochemistry. Interestingly, human HPCs were also positive for the hematopoietic cell markers CD45 and CD109. Finally, we characterized the localization of HPCs in the canals of Hering and periportal areas with six previously described markers (Oval-6, CK8, CK18, CK19, CD90 and CD117) and two potential markers (CD45 and CD109). CONCLUSION: The human HPCs are highly similar to primary hepatocytes in their transcriptional profiles. The CD45 and CD109 markers could potentially be utilized to identify and isolate HPCs for further cytotherapy of liver diseases.

25026175|t|Copy number analysis of 24 oncogenes: MDM4 identified as a putative marker for low recurrence risk in non muscle invasive bladder cancer.
25026175|a|Patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) generally have a high risk of relapsing locally after primary tumor resection. The search for new predictive markers of local recurrence thus represents an important goal for the management of this disease. We studied the copy number variations (CNVs) of 24 oncogenes (MDM4, MYCN, ALK, PDGFRA, KIT, KDR, DHFR, EGFR, MET, SMO, FGFR1, MYC, ABL1, RET, CCND1, CCND2, CDK4, MDM2, AURKB, ERBB2, TOP2A, AURKA, AR and BRAF) using multiplex ligation probe amplification technique to verify their role as predictive markers of recurrence. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 43 patients who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) were used; 23 patients had relapsed and 20 were disease-free after 5 years. Amplification frequencies were analyzed for all genes and MDM4 was the only gene that showed significantly higher amplification in non recurrent patients than in recurrent ones (0.65 vs. 0.3; Fisher's test p=0.023). Recurrence-free survival analysis confirmed the predictive role of MDM4 (log-rank test p=0.041). Our preliminary results indicate a putative role for the MDM4 gene in predicting local recurrence of bladder cancer. Confirmation of this hypothesis is needed in a larger cohort of NMIBC patients.

25082369|t|Cadmium-induced ethylene production and responses in Arabidopsis thaliana rely on ACS2 and ACS6 gene expression.
25082369|a|BACKGROUND: Anthropogenic activities cause metal pollution worldwide. Plants can absorb and accumulate these metals through their root system, inducing stress as a result of excess metal concentrations inside the plant. Ethylene is a regulator of multiple plant processes, and is affected by many biotic and abiotic stresses. Increased ethylene levels have been observed after exposure to excess metals but it remains unclear how the increased ethylene levels are achieved at the molecular level. In this study, the effects of cadmium (Cd) exposure on the production of ethylene and its precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), and on the expression of the ACC Synthase (ACS) and ACC Oxidase (ACO) multigene families were investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana. RESULTS: Increased ethylene release after Cd exposure was directly measurable in a system using rockwool-cultivated plants; enhanced levels of the ethylene precursor ACC together with higher mRNA levels of ethylene responsive genes: ACO2, ETR2 and ERF1 also indicated increased ethylene production in hydroponic culture. Regarding underlying mechanisms, it was found that the transcript levels of ACO2 and ACO4, the most abundantly expressed members of the ACO multigene family, were increased upon Cd exposure. ACC synthesis is the rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis, and transcript levels of both ACS2 and ACS6 showed the highest increase and became the most abundant isoforms after Cd exposure, suggesting their importance in the Cd-induced increase of ethylene production. CONCLUSIONS: Cadmium induced the biosynthesis of ACC and ethylene in Arabidopsis thaliana plants mainly via the increased expression of ACS2 and ACS6. This was confirmed in the acs2-1acs6-1 double knockout mutants, which showed a decreased ethylene production, positively affecting leaf biomass and resulting in a delayed induction of ethylene responsive gene expressions without significant differences in Cd contents between wild-type and mutant plants.

25218136|t|Sepsis-induced changes in amino acid transporters and leucine signaling via mTOR in skeletal muscle.
25218136|a|The present study tested the hypothesis that sepsis-induced leucine (Leu) resistance in skeletal muscle is associated with a down-regulation of amino acid transporters important in regulating Leu flux or an impairment in the formation of the Leu-sensitive mTOR-Ragulator complex. Sepsis in adult male rats decreased basal protein synthesis in gastrocnemius, associated with a reduction in mTOR activation as indicated by decreased 4E-BP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation. The ability of oral Leu to increase protein synthesis and mTOR kinase after 1 h was largely prevented in sepsis. Sepsis increased CAT1, LAT2 and SNAT2 mRNA content two- to fourfold, but only the protein content for CAT1 (20 % decrease) differed significantly. Conversely, sepsis decreased the proton-assisted amino acid transporter (PAT)-2 mRNA by 60 %, but without a coordinate change in PAT2 protein. There was no sepsis or Leu effect on the protein content for RagA-D, LAMTOR-1 and -2, raptor, Rheb or mTOR in muscle. The binding of mTOR, PRAS40 and RagC to raptor did not differ for control and septic muscle in the basal condition; however, the Leu-induced decrease in PRAS40 raptor and increase in RagC raptor seen in control muscle was absent in sepsis. The intracellular Leu concentration was increased in septic muscle, compared to basal control conditions, and oral Leu further increased the intracellular Leu concentration similarly in both control and septic rats. Hence, while alterations in select amino acid transporters are not associated with development of sepsis-induced Leu resistance, the Leu-stimulated binding of raptor with RagC and the recruitment of mTOR/raptor to the endosome-lysosomal compartment may partially explain the inability of Leu to fully activate mTOR and muscle protein synthesis.

25263533|t|CD25(+) Bcl6(low) T follicular helper cells provide help to maturing B cells in germinal centers of human tonsil.
25263533|a|The majority of CXCR5(+) PD1(+) CD4(+) T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (   >90%) are CD25(-) Bcl6(hi) , while a small subpopulation (   <10%) are CD25(+) Bcl6(low) but do not express FoxP3 and are not T regulatory cells. We purified T:B-cell conjugates from tonsils and found they were enriched for the CD25(+) Bcl6(low) Tfh-cell subpopulation. In response to IL-2, these CD25(+) Tfh cells increased expression of costimulatory molecules ICOS or OX40, upregulated transcription factor cMaf, produced cytokines IL-21, IL-17, and IL-10, and raised the levels of antiapoptotic protein Bcl2. Conjugates formed with CD25(+) BCl6(low) Tfh cells included B cells expressing higher levels of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), memory marker CD45RO, surface IgG or IgA, and MHC class II compared to B-cell conjugates including CD25(-) Bcl6(hi) Tfh cells. While IL-2 suppresses early Tfh-cell differentiation, Tfh-cell recognition of antigen-presenting B cells and signaling through the T-cell receptor likely triggers expression of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor and responses to IL-2 including downregulation of Bcl6. CD25 expression on Tfh cells and local production of IL-2 in tonsil or lymph node may support B helper T-cell function during later stages of B-cell maturation and the development of immune memory.

25305591|t|VPAC2 (vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor type 2) receptor deficient mice develop exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with increased Th1/Th17 and reduced Th2/Treg responses.
25305591|a|Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are two structurally-related neuropeptides with widespread expression in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although these peptides have been repeatedly shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory actions when administered in animal models of inflammatory disease, mice deficient in VIP and PACAP were recently shown to exhibit different phenotypes (ameliorated and exacerbated, respectively) in response to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Therefore, elucidating what are the specific immunoregulatory roles played by each of their receptor subtypes (VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1) is critical. In this study, we found that mice with a genetic deletion of VIPR2, encoding the VPAC2 receptor, exhibited exacerbated (MOG35-55)-induced EAE compared to wild type mice, characterized by enhanced clinical and histopathological features, increased proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IFN-gamma (Th1), and IL-17 (Th17)) and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGFbeta, and IL-4 (Th2)) in the CNS and lymph nodes. Moreover, the abundance and proliferative index of lymph node, thymus and CNS CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs were strikingly reduced in VPAC2-deficient mice with EAE. Finally, the in vitro suppressive activity of lymph node and splenic Tregs from VPAC2-deficient mice was impaired. Overall, our results demonstrate critical protective roles for PACAP and the VPAC2 receptor against autoimmunity, promoting the expansion and maintenance of the Treg pool.

25348624|t|Interruption of macrophage-derived IL-27(p28) production by IL-10 during sepsis requires STAT3 but not SOCS3.
25348624|a|Severe sepsis and septic shock are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Infection-associated inflammation promotes the development and progression of adverse outcomes in sepsis. The effects of heterodimeric IL-27 (p28/EBI3) have been implicated in the natural course of sepsis, whereas the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of gene expression and release of IL-27 in sepsis are poorly understood. We studied the events regulating the p28 subunit of IL-27 in endotoxic shock and polymicrobial sepsis following cecal ligation and puncture. Neutralizing Abs to IL-27(p28) improved survival rates, restricted cytokine release, and reduced bacterial burden in C57BL/6 mice during sepsis. Genetic disruption of IL-27 signaling enhanced the respiratory burst of macrophages. Experiments using splenectomized mice or treatment with clodronate liposomes suggested that macrophages in the spleen may be a significant source of IL-27(p28) during sepsis. In cultures of TLR4-activated macrophages, the frequency of F4/80(+)CD11b(+)IL-27(p28)(+) cells was reduced by the addition of IL-10. IL-10 antagonized both MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent release of IL-27(p28). Genetic deletion of STAT3 in Tie2-Cre/STAT3flox macrophages completely interrupted the inhibition of IL-27(p28) by IL-10 after TLR4 activation. In contrast, IL-10 remained fully active to suppress IL-27(p28) with deletion of SOCS3 in Tie2-Cre/SOCS3flox macrophages. Blockade of IL-10R by Ab or genetic deficiency of IL-10 resulted in 3-5-fold higher concentrations of IL-27(p28) in endotoxic shock and polymicrobial sepsis. Our studies identify IL-10 as a critical suppressing factor for IL-27(p28) production during infection-associated inflammation. These findings may be helpful for a beneficial manipulation of adverse IL-27(p28) release during sepsis.

25575814|t|MIG-7 and phosphorylated prohibitin coordinately regulate lung cancer invasion/metastasis.
25575814|a|Growth factors and COX-2/PGE2 enhance lung cancer invasion/metastasis via PI3K/Akt and RAS/Raf. Here, we explored their mechanism of action further. We found first that higher levels of migration inducting gene-7 protein (MIG-7) and PHB phosphorylated at threonine 258 (phospho-PHBT258) are positively correlated with advanced stages of human lung cancer in tissue microarray. PGE2 or growth factors such as EGF, HGF and IGF-1 increased complex formation of phospho-PHBT258 with Ras, phospho-AktS473, phospho-Raf-1S338, MEKK1 and IKKalpha/betaS176/180 in the raft domain transiently within 1 hour and MIG-7 in the cytosol 12-24 hours later. Association of phospho-PHBT258 with MEKK1 but not MEKK3 activates IKK/IkappaB/NF-kappaB and MEK/ERK to increase cellular COX-2/PGE2 and an E-cadherin suppressor Snail leading to enhancement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lung cancer migration/invasion. MIG-7, on the other hand, was induced by growth factors and PGE2 via Akt/GSK-3beta in a phospho-PHBT258 independent manner. MIG-7 increased two E-cadherin suppressors ZEB-1 and Twist to enhance EMT and cancer migration/invasion. Downregulating phospho-PHBT258 and MIG-7 had an additive effect on attenuating lung cancer invasion/metastasis and prolonging the survival of xenograft mice. Phospho-PHBT258 and MIG-7 may thus play complementary roles in the initiation and sustainment of the effects of growth factors and COX-2/PGE2 on cancer invasion/metastasis.

25589620|t|Pharmacogenetic Analysis of INT 0144 Trial: Association of Polymorphisms with Survival and Toxicity in Rectal Cancer Patients Treated with 5-FU and Radiation.
25589620|a|PURPOSE: We tested whether 18 polymorphisms in 16 genes (GSTP1, COX2, IL10, EGFR, EGF, FGFR4, CCDN1, VEGFR2, VEGF, CXCR2, IL8, MMP3, ICAM1, ERCC1, RAD51, and XRCC3) would predict disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity in the INT0144 trial, which was designed to investigate different postoperative regimens of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation (CRT) in locally advanced rectal cancers: Arm 1 consisted of bolus 5-FU followed by 5-FU protracted venous infusion (PVI) with radiotherapy; arm 2 was induction and concomitant PVI 5-FU with radiotherapy and arm 3 was induction and concomitant bolus 5-FU with radiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA from 746 stage II/III rectal patients enrolled in the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S9304 phase III trial was analyzed. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. The polymorphisms were analyzed using direct DNA-sequencing or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: GSTP1-Ile105Val (rs1695) was significantly associated with DFS and OS and its effect did not vary by treatment arm. The five-year DFS and OS were 53% and 58%, respectively, for G/G, 66% and 72% for G/A, and 57% and 66% for A/A patients. In arm 2, IL8-251A/A genotype (rs4073) was associated with a lower risk of toxicities (P = 0.04). The VEGFR2 H472Q Q/Q genotype (rs1870377) was associated with a higher risk of grade 3-5 proximal upper gastrointestinal tract (PUGIT) mucositis (P = 0.04) in arm 2. However, in arm 1, this genotype was associated with a lower risk of PUGIT mucositis (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: rs1695 may be prognostic in patients with rectal cancer treated with adjuvant CRT. rs4073 and rs1870377 may exhibit different associations with toxicity, according to the 5-FU schedule.

25605239|t|Expression of the potential therapeutic target CXXC5 in primary acute myeloid leukemia cells - high expression is associated with adverse prognosis as well as altered intracellular signaling and transcriptional regulation.
25605239|a|The CXXC5 gene encodes a transcriptional activator with a zinc-finger domain, and high expression in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells is associated with adverse prognosis. We now characterized the biological context of CXXC5 expression in primary human AML cells. The global gene expression profile of AML cells derived from 48 consecutive patients was analyzed; cells with high and low CXXC5 expression then showed major differences with regard to extracellular communication and intracellular signaling. We observed significant differences in the phosphorylation status of several intracellular signaling mediators (CREB, PDK1, SRC, STAT1, p38, STAT3, rpS6) that are important for PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and/or transcriptional regulation. High CXXC5 expression was also associated with high mRNA expression of several stem cell-associated transcriptional regulators, the strongest associations being with WT1, GATA2, RUNX1, LYL1, DNMT3, SPI1, and MYB. Finally, CXXC5 knockdown in human AML cell lines caused significantly increased expression of the potential tumor suppressor gene TSC22 and genes encoding the growth factor receptor KIT, the cytokine Angiopoietin 1 and the selenium-containing glycoprotein Selenoprotein P. Thus, high CXXC5 expression seems to affect several steps in human leukemogenesis, including intracellular events as well as extracellular communication.

25622904|t|Inactivation of Sag/Rbx2/Roc2 e3 ubiquitin ligase triggers senescence and inhibits kras-induced immortalization.
25622904|a|Our recent study showed that SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates apoptosis and vasculogenesis by promoting degradation of NOXA and NF1, and co-operates with Kras to promote lung tumorigenesis by activating NFkappaB and mTOR pathways via targeted degradation of tumor suppressive substrates including IkappaB, DEPTOR, p21 and p27. Here we investigated the role of Sag/Rbx2 E3 ligase in cellular senescence and immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and report that Sag is required for proper cell proliferation and Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization. Sag inactivation by genetic deletion remarkably suppresses cell proliferation by inducing senescence, which is associated with accumulation of p16, but not p53. Mechanistically, Sag deletion caused accumulation of Jun-B, a substrate of Sag-Fbxw7 E3 ligase and a transcription factor that drives p16 transcription. Importantly, senescence triggered by Sag deletion can be largely rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a, the p16 encoding gene, indicating its causal role. Furthermore, Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization can also be abrogated by Sag deletion via senescence induction, which is again rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a. Finally, we found that Sag deletion inactivates Kras(G12D) activity and block the MAPK signaling pathway, together with accumulated p16, to induce senescence. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Sag is a Kras(G12D)-cooperating oncogene required for Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization and transformation, and targeting SAG-SCF E3 ligase may, therefore, have therapeutic value for senescence-based cancer treatment.

25639242|t|Nitrogen regulates AMPK to control TORC1 signaling.
25639242|a|BACKGROUND: Cell growth and cell-cycle progression are tightly coordinated to enable cells to adjust their size (timing of division) to the demands of proliferation in varying nutritional environments. In fission yeast, nitrogen stress results in sustained proliferation at a reduced size. RESULTS: Here, we show that cells can sense nitrogen stress to reduce target of rapamycin complex-1 (TORC1) activity. Nitrogen-stress-induced TORC1 inhibition differs from amino-acid-dependent control of TORC1 and requires the Ssp2 (AMPKalpha) kinase, the Tsc1/2 complex, and Rhb1 GTPase. Importantly, the beta and gamma regulatory subunits of AMPK are not required to control cell division in response to nitrogen stress, providing evidence for a nitrogen-sensing mechanism that is independent of changes in intracellular ATP/AMP levels. The CaMKK homolog Ssp1 is constitutively required for phosphorylation of the AMPKalpha(Ssp2) T loop. However, we find that a second homolog CaMKK(Ppk34) is specifically required to stimulate AMPKalpha(Ssp2) activation in response to nitrogen stress. Finally, ammonia also controls mTORC1 activity in human cells; mTORC1 is activated upon the addition of ammonium to glutamine-starved Hep3B cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: The alternative nitrogen source ammonia can simulate TORC1 activity to support growth and division under challenging nutrient settings, a situation often seen in cancer.

25710042|t|Sex-differences in renal expression of selected transporters and transcription factors in lean and obese Zucker spontaneously hypertensive fatty rats.
25710042|a|The aim of this study was to identify sex-dependent expression of renal transporter mRNA in lean and obese Zucker spontaneously hypertensive fatty (ZSF1) rats and to investigate the interaction of the most altered transporter, organic anion transporter 2 (Oat2), with diabetes-relevant metabolites and drugs. Higher incidence of glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and protein casts in Bowman's space and tubular lumen was detected by PAS staining in obese male compared to female ZSF1 rats. Real-time PCR on RNA isolated from kidney cortex revealed that Sglt1-2, Oat1-3, and Oct1 were higher expressed in kidneys of lean females. Oct2 and Mrp2 were higher expressed in obese males. Renal mRNA levels of transporters were reduced with diabetic nephropathy in females and the expression of transcription factors Hnf1beta and Hnf4alpha in both sexes. The highest difference between lean and obese ZSF1 rats was found for Oat2. Therefore, we have tested the interaction of human OAT2 with various substances using tritium-labeled cGMP. Human OAT2 showed no interaction with diabetes-related metabolites, diabetic drugs, and ACE-inhibitors. However, OAT2-dependent uptake of cGMP was inhibited by furosemide. The strongly decreased expression of Oat2 and other transporters in female diabetic ZSF1 rats could possibly impair renal drug excretion, for example, of furosemide.

25840913|t|mTORC2 Deficiency in Myeloid Dendritic Cells Enhances Their Allogeneic Th1 and Th17 Stimulatory Ability after TLR4 Ligation In Vitro and In Vivo.
25840913|a|The mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key integrative kinase that functions in two independent complexes, mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and mTORC2. In contrast to the well-defined role of mTORC1 in dendritic cells (DC), little is known about the function of mTORC2. In this study, to our knowledge, we demonstrate for the first time an enhanced ability of mTORC2-deficient myeloid DC to stimulate and polarize allogeneic T cells. We show that activated bone marrow-derived DC from conditional Rictor(-/-) mice exhibit lower coinhibitory B7-H1 molecule expression independently of the stimulus and enhanced IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-12p70, and IL-23 production following TLR4 ligation. Accordingly, TLR4-activated Rictor(-/-) DC display augmented allogeneic T cell stimulatory ability, expanding IFN-gamma(+) and IL-17(+), but not IL-10(+) or CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in vitro. A similar DC profile was obtained by stimulating Dectin-1 (C-type lectin family member) on Rictor(-/-) DC. Using novel CD11c-specific Rictor(-/-) mice, we confirm the alloreactive Th1 and Th17 cell-polarizing ability of endogenous mTORC2-deficient DC after TLR4 ligation in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that proinflammatory cytokines produced by Rictor(-/-) DC after LPS stimulation are key in promoting Th1/Th17 responses. These data establish that mTORC2 activity restrains conventional DC proinflammatory capacity and their ability to polarize T cells following TLR and non-TLR stimulation. Our findings provide new insight into the role of mTORC2 in regulating DC function and may have implications for emerging therapeutic strategies that target mTOR in cancer, infectious diseases, and transplantation.

25874935|t|Neuroprotective effect of neuroserpin in oxygen-glucose deprivation- and reoxygenation-treated rat astrocytes in vitro.
25874935|a|Neuroserpin (NSP) reportedly exerts neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemic animal models and patients; however, the mechanism of protection is poorly understood. We thus attempted to confirm neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes in the ischemic state and then explored the relative mechanisms. Astrocytes from neonatal rats were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R). To confirm the neuroprotective effects of NSP, we measured the cell survival rate, relative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release; we also performed morphological methods, namely Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V assay. To explore the potential mechanisms of NSP, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-alpha related to NSP administration were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The proteins related to the NF-kappaB, ERK1/2, and PI3K/Akt pathways were investigated by Western blotting. To verify the cause-and-effect relationship between neuroprotection and the NF-kappaB pathway, a NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor sc3060 was employed to observe the effects of NSP-induced neuroprotection. We found that NSP significantly increased the cell survival rate and reduced LDH release in OGD/R-treated astrocytes. It also reduced NO/TNF-alpha release. Western blotting showed that the protein levels of p-IKKBalpha/beta and P65 were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment and such effects were significantly inhibited by NSP administration. The NSP-induced inhibition could be significantly reversed by administration of the NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor sc3060, whereas, expressions of p-ERK1, p-ERK2, and p-AKT were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment; however, their levels were unchanged by NSP administration. Our results thus verified the neuroprotective effects of NSP in ischemic astrocytes. The potential mechanisms include inhibition of the release of NO/TNF-alpha and repression of the NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Our data also indicated that NSP has little influence on the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.

25979836|t|Gastrointestinal hormones/neurotransmitters and growth factors can activate P21 activated kinase 2 in pancreatic acinar cells by novel mechanisms.
25979836|a|P-21-activated kinases (PAKs) are serine/threonine kinases comprising six isoforms divided in two groups, group-I (PAK1-3)/group-II (PAK4-6) which play important roles in cell cytoskeletal dynamics, survival, secretion and proliferation and are activated by diverse stimuli. However, little is known about PAKs ability to be activated by gastrointestinal (GI) hormones/neurotransmitters/growth-factors. We used rat pancreatic acini to explore the ability of GI-hormones/neurotransmitters/growth-factors to activate Group-I-PAKs and the signaling cascades involved. Only PAK2 was present in acini. PAK2 was activated by some pancreatic growth-factors [EGF, PDGF, bFGF], by secretagogues activating phospholipase-C (PLC) [CCK, carbachol, bombesin] and by post-receptor stimulants activating PKC [TPA], but not agents only mobilizing cellular calcium or increasing cyclic AMP. CCK-activation of PAK2 required both high- and low-affinity-CCK1-receptor-state activation. It was partially reduced by PKC- or Src-inhibition, but not with PI3K-inhibitors (wortmannin, LY294002) or thapsigargin. IPA-3, which prevents PAK2 binding to small-GTPases partially inhibited PAK2-activation, as well as reduced CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation and amylase release induced by CCK or bombesin. This study demonstrates pancreatic acini, possess only one Group-I-PAK, PAK2. CCK and other GI-hormones/neurotransmitters/growth-factors activate PAK2 via small GTPases (CDC42/Rac1), PKC and SFK but not cytosolic calcium or PI3K. CCK-activation of PAK2 showed several novel features being dependent on both receptor-activation states, having PLC- and PKC-dependent/independent components and small-GTPase-dependent/independent components. These results show that PAK2 is important in signaling cascades activated by numerous pancreatic stimuli which mediate their various physiological/pathophysiological responses and thus could be a promising target for the development of therapies in some pancreatic disorders such as pancreatitis.

25998905|t|The Arabidopsis thaliana elongator complex subunit 2 epigenetically affects root development.
25998905|a|The elongator complex subunit 2 (ELP2) protein, one subunit of an evolutionarily conserved histone acetyltransferase complex, has been shown to participate in leaf patterning, plant immune and abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, its role in root development was explored. Compared to the wild type, the elp2 mutant exhibited an accelerated differentiation of its root stem cells and cell division was more active in its quiescent centre (QC). The key transcription factors responsible for maintaining root stem cell and QC identity, such as AP2 transcription factors PLT1 (PLETHORA1) and PLT2 (PLETHORA2), GRAS transcription factors such as SCR (SCARECROW) and SHR (SHORT ROOT) and WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX5 transcription factor WOX5, were all strongly down-regulated in the mutant. On the other hand, expression of the G2/M transition activator CYCB1 was substantially induced in elp2. The auxin efflux transporters PIN1 and PIN2 showed decreased protein levels and PIN1 also displayed mild polarity alterations in elp2, which resulted in a reduced auxin content in the root tip. Either the acetylation or methylation level of each of these genes differed between the mutant and the wild type, suggesting that the ELP2 regulation of root development involves the epigenetic modification of a range of transcription factors and other developmental regulators.

26025664|t|Transmembrane-Bound IL-15-Promoted Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Renal Cancer Cells Requires the Src-Dependent Akt/GSK-3beta/beta-Catenin Pathway.
26025664|a|Intrarenal interleukin-15 (IL-15) plays a major role controlling epithelial survival and polarization both in physiological and pathologic conditions. Herein, we confirmed that human renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) express a membrane-bound IL-15 isoform displaying an unusual molecular weight of 27 kDa. Its stimulation with soluble IL-15 receptor alpha chain (s-IL-15Ralpha) triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process as shown by the down-regulation of E-cadherin and zona occludens 1 and the up-regulation of vimentin and N-cadherin and promotes the migratory and invasive properties of RCC. S-IL-15Ralpha treatment triggered the Src/PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta pathway and promoted beta-catenin nuclei translocation. Deactivation of this pathway by using Src-specific inhibitor PP2, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and AKT inhibitor MK2206 hampered beta-catenin nuclei translocation and suppressed EMT, migration, and invasion of RCC. S-IL-15Ralpha treatment also enhanced Src-dependent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2). FAK knockdown significantly decreased the migration and invasion of RCC, which suggest that Src-FAK signaling was involved in s-IL-15Ralpha-favored migration and invasion of RCC. At the same time, inhibitors of Erk1/2 also significantly decreased the migration and invasion of RCC but could not reverse s-IL-15Ralpha-induced EMT. Taken together, our results reveal that Src-dependent PI3K/Akt/GSK3b/beta-catenin pathway is required for s-IL-15Ra-dependent induction of EMT in RCC, while Src-FAK and Src-Erk1/2 signaling were involved in s-IL-15Ralpha-promoted migration and invasion properties of RCC. Our study provides a better understanding of IL-15 signaling in RCC tumor progression, which may lead to novel targeted therapies and provide some suggestions when using IL-15 in clinic.

26027517|t|The autotaxin-LPA2 GPCR axis is modulated by gamma-irradiation and facilitates DNA damage repair.
26027517|a|In this study we characterized the effects of radiation injury on the expression and function of the autotaxin (ATX)-LPA2 GPCR axis. In IEC-6 crypt cells and jejunum enteroids quantitative RT-PCR showed a time- and dose-dependent upregulation of lpa2 in response to gamma-irradiation that was abolished by mutation of the NF-kappaB site in the lpa2 promoter or by inhibition of ATM/ATR kinases with CGK-733, suggesting that lpa2 is a DNA damage response gene upregulated by ATM via NF-kappaB. The resolution kinetics of the DNA damage marker gamma-H2AX in LPA-treated IEC-6 cells exposed to gamma-irradiation was accelerated compared to vehicle, whereas pharmacological inhibition of LPA2 delayed the resolution of gamma-H2AX. In LPA2-reconstituted MEF cells lacking LPA1    '3 the levels of gamma-H2AX decreased rapidly, whereas in Vector MEF were high and remained sustained. Inhibition of ERK1    '2 or PI3K/AKT signaling axis by pertussis toxin or the C311A/C314A/L351A mutation in the C-terminus of LPA2 abrogated the effect of LPA on DNA repair. LPA2 transcripts in Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) enriched for bone marrow stem cells were 27- and 5-fold higher than in common myeloid or lymphoid progenitors, respectively. Furthermore, after irradiation higher residual gamma-H2AX levels were detected in the bone marrow or jejunum of irradiated LPA2-KO mice compared to WT mice. We found that gamma-irradiation increases plasma ATX activity and LPA level that is in part due to the previously established radiation-induced upregulation of TNFalpha. These findings identify ATX and LPA2 as radiation-regulated genes that appear to play a physiological role in DNA repair.

26065826|t|MAPK signaling downstream to TLR4 contributes to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.
26065826|a|Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been implicated as a locus for initiation of paclitaxel related chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). This project explores the involvement of the immediate down-stream signal molecules in inducing paclitaxel CIPN. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) were measured in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the spinal cord over time using Western blot and immunohistochemistry in a rat model of paclitaxel CIPN. The effects of MAPK inhibitors in preventing and reversing behavioral signs of CIPN were also measured (group sizes 4-9). Extracellular signal related kinase (ERK1/2) and P38 but not c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) or PI3K-Akt signaling expression was increased in DRG. Phospho-ERK1/2 staining was co-localized to small CGRP-positive DRG neurons in cell profiles surrounding large DRG neurons consistent with satellite glial cells. The expression of phospho-P38 was co-localized to small IB4-positive and CGRP-positive DRG neurons. The TLR4 antagonist LPS derived from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (LPS-RS) inhibited paclitaxel-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38. The MAPK inhibitors PD98059 (MEK1/2), U0126 (MEK1/2) and SB203580 (P38) prevented but did not reverse paclitaxel-induced behavioral hypersensitivity. Paclitaxel treatment resulted in phosphorylation of Inhibitor alpha of NFkappaB (IkappaBalpha) in DRG resulting in an apparent release of NFkappaB from the IkappaBalpha-NFkappaB complex as increased expression of nuclear NFkappaB was also observed. LPS-RS inhibited paclitaxel-induced translocation of NFkappaB in DRG. No change was observed in spinal NFkappaB. These results implicate TLR4 signaling via MAP kinases and NFkappaB in the induction and maintenance of paclitaxel-related CIPN.

26086963|t|Nitric oxide stress and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase impair beta-cell sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2b activity and protein stability.
26086963|a|The sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) pump maintains a steep Ca(2+) concentration gradient between the cytosol and ER lumen in the pancreatic beta-cell, and the integrity of this gradient has a central role in regulated insulin production and secretion, maintenance of ER function and beta-cell survival. We have previously demonstrated loss of beta-cell SERCA2b expression under diabetic conditions. To define the mechanisms underlying this, INS-1 cells and rat islets were treated with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) combined with or without cycloheximide or actinomycin D. IL-1beta treatment led to increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene and protein expression, which occurred concurrently with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). IL-1beta led to decreased SERCA2b mRNA and protein expression, whereas time-course experiments revealed a reduction in protein half-life with no change in mRNA stability. Moreover, SERCA2b protein but not mRNA levels were rescued by treatment with the NOS inhibitor l-NMMA (NG-monomethyl L-arginine), whereas the NO donor SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine) and the AMPK activator AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide) recapitulated the effects of IL-1beta on SERCA2b protein stability. Similarly, IL-1beta-induced reductions in SERCA2b expression were rescued by pharmacological inhibition of AMPK with compound C or by transduction of a dominant-negative form of AMPK, whereas beta-cell death was prevented in parallel. Finally, to determine a functional relationship between NO and AMPK signaling and SERCA2b activity, fura-2/AM (fura-2-acetoxymethylester) Ca(2+) imaging experiments were performed in INS-1 cells. Consistent with observed changes in SERCA2b expression, IL-1beta, SNAP and AICAR increased cytosolic Ca(2+) and decreased ER Ca(2+) levels, suggesting congruent modulation of SERCA activity under these conditions. In aggregate, these results show that SERCA2b protein stability is decreased under inflammatory conditions through NO- and AMPK-dependent pathways and provide novel insight into pathways leading to altered beta-cell calcium homeostasis and reduced beta-cell survival in diabetes.

26131711|t|Two Distinct Cdc2 Pools Regulate Cell Cycle Progression and the DNA Damage Response in the Fission Yeast S.pombe.
26131711|a|The activity of Cdc2 (CDK1) kinase, which coordinates cell cycle progression and DNA break repair, is blocked upon its phosphorylation at tyrosine 15 (Y15) by Wee1 kinase in the presence of DNA damage. How Cdc2 can support DNA repair whilst being inactivated by the DNA damage checkpoint remains to be explained. Human CDK1 is phosphorylated by Myt1 kinase at threonine 14 (T14) close to its ATP binding site before being modified at threonine 161 (T167Sp) in its T-loop by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK). While modification of T161 promotes association with the cyclin partner, phosphorylation of T14 inhibits the CDK1-cyclin complex. This inhibition is further enforced by the modification of Y15 by Wee1 in the presence of DNA lesions. In S.pombe, the dominant inhibition of Cdc2 is provided by the phosphorylation of Y15 and only a small amount of Cdc2 is modified at T14 when cells are in S phase. Unlike human cells, both inhibitory modifications are executed by Wee1. Using the novel IEFPT technology, which combines isoelectric focusing (IEF) with Phos-tag SDS electrophoresis (PT), we report here that S.pombe Cdc2 kinase exists in seven forms. While five forms are phosphorylated, two species are not. Four phospho-forms associate with cyclin B (Cdc13) of which only two are modified at Y15 by Wee1. Interestingly, only one Y15-modified species carries also the T14 modification. The fifth phospho-form has a low affinity for cyclin B and is neither Y15 nor T14 modified. The two unphosphorylated forms may contribute directly to the DNA damage response as only they associate with the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Chk1. Interestingly, cyclin B is also present in the unphosphorylated pool. We also show that the G146D mutation in Cdc2.1w, which renders Cdc2 insensitive to Wee1 inhibition, is aberrantly modified in a Wee1-dependent manner. In conclusion, our work adds support to the idea that two distinct Cdc2 pools regulate cell cycle progression and the response to DNA damage.

26270232|t|Serum levels of chemokines CCL4 and CCL5 in cirrhotic patients indicate the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma.
26270232|a|BACKGROUND: Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are diagnosed at an advanced stage. The prognostic value of serum tumour markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) is limited. The aim of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum growth factors, apoptotic and inflammatory mediators of cirrhotic patients with and without HCC. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from cirrhotic potential liver transplant patients (LTx) with (n=61) and without HCC (n=78) as well as from healthy controls (HCs; n=39). Serum concentrations of CRP, neopterin and IL-6 as markers of inflammation and thrombopoietin (TPO), GCSF, FGF basic and VEGF, HMGB1, CK-18 (M65) and CK18 fragment (M30) and a panel of proinflammatory chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL5 and IL-8) were measured. Chi square, Fisher exact, Mann-Whitney U-tests, ROC curve analysis and forward stepwise logistic regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Patients with HCC had higher serum TPO and chemokines (P   <0.001 for TPO, CCL4, CCL5 and CXCL5) and lower CCL2 (P=0.008) levels than cirrhotic patients without HCC. Multivariate forward stepwise regression analysis for significant parameters showed that among the studied parameters CCL4 and CCL5 (P=0.001) are diagnostic markers of HCC. Serum levels of TPO and chemokines were lower, whereas M30 was significantly higher in cirrhotic patients than in HCs. CONCLUSIONS: High serum levels of inflammatory chemokines such as CCL4 and CCL5 in the serum of cirrhotic patients indicate the presence of HCC.

26348666|t|Hedgehog signaling mediates woven bone formation and vascularization during stress fracture healing.
26348666|a|Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is critical in developmental osteogenesis, and recent studies suggest it may also play a role in regulating osteogenic gene expression in the post-natal setting. However, there is a void of studies directly assessing the effect of Hh inhibition on post-natal osteogenesis. This study utilized a cyclic loading-induced ulnar stress fracture model to evaluate the hypothesis that Hh signaling contributes to osteogenesis and angiogenesis during stress fracture healing. Immediately prior to loading, adult rats were given GDC-0449 (Vismodegib - a selective Hh pathway inhibitor; 50mg/kg orally twice daily), or vehicle. Hh signaling was upregulated in response to stress fracture at 3 days (Ptch1, Gli1 expression), and was markedly inhibited by GDC-0449 at 1 day and 3 days in the loaded and non-loaded ulnae. GDC-0449 did not affect Hh ligand expression (Shh, Ihh, Dhh) at 1 day, but decreased Shh expression by 37% at 3 days. GDC-0449 decreased woven bone volume (-37%) and mineral density (-17%) at 7 days. Dynamic histomorphometry revealed that the 7 day callus was composed predominantly of woven bone in both groups. The observed reduction in woven bone occurred concomitantly with decreased expression of Alpl and Ibsp, but was not associated with differences in early cellular proliferation (as determined by callus PCNA staining at 3 days), osteoblastic differentiation (Osx expression at 1 day and 3 days), chondrogenic gene expression (Acan, Sox9, and Col2alpha1 expression at 1 day and 3 days), or bone resorption metrics (callus TRAP staining at 3 days, Rankl and Opg expression at 1 day and 3 days). To evaluate angiogenesis, vWF immunohistochemistry showed that GDC-0449 reduced fracture callus blood vessel density by 55% at 3 days, which was associated with increased Hif1alpha gene expression (+30%). Dynamic histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that GDC-0449 also inhibited lamellar bone formation. Lamellar bone analysis of the loaded limb (directly adjacent to the woven bone callus) showed that GDC-0449 significantly decreased mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR/BS) (-17% and -20%, respectively). Lamellar BFR/BS in the non-loaded ulna was also significantly decreased (-37%), indicating that Hh signaling was required for normal bone modeling. In conclusion, Hh signaling plays an important role in post-natal osteogenesis in the setting of stress fracture healing, mediating its effects directly through regulation of bone formation and angiogenesis.

26466330|t|Thymosin beta 4 up-regulates miR-200a expression and induces differentiation and survival of rat brain progenitor cells.
26466330|a|Thymosin beta 4 (Tbeta4), a secreted 43 amino acid peptide, promotes oligodendrogenesis, and improves neurological outcome in rat models of neurologic injury. We demonstrated that exogenous Tbeta4 treatment up-regulated the expression of the miR-200a in vitro in rat brain progenitor cells and in vivo in the peri-infarct area of rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The up-regulation of miR-200a down-regulated the expression of the following targets in vitro and in vivo models: (i) growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), an adaptor protein involved in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Grb2/Ras/MEK/ERK1/c-Jun signaling pathway, which negatively regulates the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), a marker of mature oligodendrocyte; (ii) ERRFI-1/Mig-6, an endogenous potent kinase inhibitor of EGFR, which resulted in activation/phosphorylation of EGFR; (iii) friend of GATA 2, and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10 (PTEN), which are potent inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway, and resulted in marked activation of AKT; and (iv) transcription factor, p53, which induces pro-apoptotic genes, and possibly reduced apoptosis of the progenitor cells subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). Anti-miR-200a transfection reversed all the effects of Tbeta4 treatment in vitro. Thus, Tbeta4 up-regulated MBP synthesis, and inhibited OGD-induced apoptosis in a novel miR-200a dependent EGFR signaling pathway. Our findings of miR-200a-mediated protection of progenitor cells may provide a new therapeutic importance for the treatment of neurologic injury. Tbeta4-induced micro-RNA-200a (miR-200a) regulates EGFR signaling pathways for MBP synthesis and apoptosis: up-regulation of miR-200a after Tbeta4 treatment, increases MBP synthesis after targeting Grb2 and thereby inactivating c-Jun from inhibition of MBP synthesis; and also inhibits OGD-mediated apoptosis after targeting EGFR inhibitor (Mig-6), PI3K inhibitors (FOG2 and Pten) and an inducer (p53) of pro-apoptotic genes, for AKT activation and down-regulation of p53. These findings may contribute the therapeutic benefits for stroke and other neuronal diseases associated with demyelination disorders.

26466350|t|Dopamine D2-Receptor Antagonists Down-Regulate CYP1A1/2 and CYP1B1 in the Rat Liver.
26466350|a|Dopaminergic systems regulate the release of several hormones including growth hormone (GH), thyroid hormones, insulin, glucocorticoids and prolactin (PRL) that play significant roles in the regulation of various Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. The present study investigated the role of dopamine D2-receptor-linked pathways in the regulation of CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 that belong to a battery of genes controlled by the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) and play a crucial role in the metabolism and toxicity of numerous environmental toxicants. Inhibition of dopamine D2-receptors with sulpiride (SULP) significantly repressed the constitutive and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)-induced CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B expression in the rat liver. The expression of AhR, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) was suppressed by SULP in B[a]P-treated livers, whereas the AhRR expression was increased by the drug suggesting that the SULP-mediated repression of the CYP1 inducibility is due to inactivation of the AhR regulatory system. At signal transduction level, the D2-mediated down-regulation of constitutive CYP1A1/2 and CYP1B1 expression appears to be mediated by activation of the insulin/PI3K/AKT pathway. PRL-linked pathways exerting a negative control on various CYPs, and inactivation of the glucocorticoid-linked pathways that positively control the AhR-regulated CYP1 genes, may also participate in the SULP-mediated repression of both, the constitutive and induced CYP1 expression. The present findings indicate that drugs acting as D2-dopamine receptor antagonists can modify several hormone systems that regulate the expression of CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1, and may affect the toxicity and carcinogenicity outcome of numerous toxicants and pre-carcinogenic substances. Therefore, these drugs could be considered as a part of the strategy to reduce the risk of exposure to environmental pollutants and pre-carcinogens.

26516699|t|Changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression during pancreatic cancer development and progression in a genetically engineered KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre mouse (KC) model.
26516699|a|Differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been demonstrated in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PC). Due to the lack of tissue samples from early-stages of PC, the stage-specific alteration of miRNAs during PC initiation and progression is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the global miRNA expression profile and their processing machinery during PC progression using the KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre (KC) mouse model. At 25 weeks, the miRNA microarray analysis revealed significant downregulation of miR-150, miR-494, miR-138, miR-148a, miR-216a, and miR-217 and upregulation of miR-146b, miR-205, miR-31, miR-192, and miR-21 in KC mice compared to controls. Further, expression of miRNA biosynthetic machinery including Dicer, Exportin-5, TRKRA, and TARBP2 were downregulated, while DGCR8 and Ago2 were upregulated in KC mice. In addition, from 10 to 50 weeks of age, stage-specific expression profiling of miRNA in KC mice revealed downregulation of miR-216, miR-217, miR-100, miR-345, miR-141, miR-483-3p, miR-26b, miR-150, miR-195, Let-7b and Let-96 and upregulation of miR-21, miR-205, miR-146b, miR-34c, miR-1273, miR-223 and miR-195 compared to control mice. Interestingly, the differential expression of miRNA in mice also corroborated with the miRNA expression in human PC cell lines and tissue samples; ectopic expression of Let-7b in CD18/HPAF and Capan1 cells resulted in the downregulation of KRAS and MSST1 expression. Overall, the present study aids an understanding of miRNA expression patterns during PC pathogenesis and helps to facilitate the identification of promising and novel early diagnostic/prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.

26545401|t|Identification of Evening Complex Associated Proteins in Arabidopsis by Affinity Purification and Mass Spectrometry.
26545401|a|Many species possess an endogenous circadian clock to synchronize internal physiology with an oscillating external environment. In plants, the circadian clock coordinates growth, metabolism and development over daily and seasonal time scales. Many proteins in the circadian network form oscillating complexes that temporally regulate myriad processes, including signal transduction, transcription, protein degradation and post-translational modification. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a tripartite complex composed of EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4), EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), and LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX), named the evening complex, modulates daily rhythms in gene expression and growth through transcriptional regulation. However, little is known about the physical interactions that connect the circadian system to other pathways. We used affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS) methods to identify proteins that associate with the evening complex in A. thaliana. New connections within the circadian network as well as to light signaling pathways were identified, including linkages between the evening complex, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), TIME FOR COFFEE (TIC), all phytochromes and TANDEM ZINC KNUCKLE/PLUS3 (TZP). Coupling genetic mutation with affinity purifications tested the roles of phytochrome B (phyB), EARLY FLOWERING 4, and EARLY FLOWERING 3 as nodes connecting the evening complex to clock and light signaling pathways. These experiments establish a hierarchical association between pathways and indicate direct and indirect interactions. Specifically, the results suggested that EARLY FLOWERING 3 and phytochrome B act as hubs connecting the clock and red light signaling pathways. Finally, we characterized a clade of associated nuclear kinases that regulate circadian rhythms, growth, and flowering in A. thaliana. Coupling mass spectrometry and genetics is a powerful method to rapidly and directly identify novel components and connections within and between complex signaling pathways.

26556829|t|ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 mutations cause autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
26556829|a|Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a group of hereditary peripheral neuropathies that share clinical characteristics of progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, foot deformities, distal sensory loss, as well as diminished tendon reflexes. Hundreds of causative DNA changes have been found, but much of the genetic basis of the disease is still unexplained. Mutations in the ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 gene are a frequent cause of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum and peripheral axonal neuropathy, and account for ~ 40% of autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The overlap of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with both diseases, as well as the common autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of thin corpus callosum and axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in three related patients, prompted us to analyse the ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 gene in affected individuals with autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We investigated 28 unrelated families with autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease defined by clinical, electrophysiological, as well as pathological evaluation. Besides, we screened for all the known genes related to axonal autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2, CMT2B1/LMNA, CMT2B2/MED25, CMT2B5/NEFL, ARCMT2F/dHMN2B/HSPB1, CMT2K/GDAP1, CMT2P/LRSAM1, CMT2R/TRIM2, CMT2S/IGHMBP2, CMT2T/HSJ1, CMTRID/COX6A1, ARAN-NM/HINT and GAN/GAN), for the genes related to autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum and axonal peripheral neuropathy (SPG7/PGN, SPG15/ZFYVE26, SPG21/ACP33, SPG35/FA2H, SPG46/GBA2, SPG55/C12orf65 and SPG56/CYP2U1), as well as for the causative gene of peripheral neuropathy with or without agenesis of the corpus callosum (SLC12A6). Mitochondrial disorders related to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 were also excluded by sequencing POLG and TYMP genes. An additional locus for autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2H on chromosome 8q13-21.1 was excluded by linkage analysis. Pedigrees originated in Italy, Brazil, Canada, England, Iran, and Japan. Interestingly, we identified 15 ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 mutations in 12 families (two sequence variants were never reported before, p.Gln198* and p.Pro2212fs*5). No large deletions/duplications were detected in these patients. The novel mutations seemed to be pathogenic since they co-segregated with the disease in all pedigrees and were absent in 300 unrelated controls. Furthermore, in silico analysis predicted their pathogenic effect. Our results indicate that ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 is the causative gene of a wide spectrum of clinical features, including autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

26587585|t|Dendritic Cell-Specific Deletion of beta-Catenin Results in Fewer Regulatory T-Cells without Exacerbating Autoimmune Collagen-Induced Arthritis.
26587585|a|Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells that have the dual ability to stimulate immunity and maintain tolerance. However, the signalling pathways mediating tolerogenic DC function in vivo remain largely unknown. The beta-catenin pathway has been suggested to promote a regulatory DC phenotype. The aim of this study was to unravel the role of beta-catenin signalling to control DC function in the autoimmune collagen-induced arthritis model (CIA). Deletion of beta-catenin specifically in DCs was achieved by crossing conditional knockout mice with a CD11c-Cre transgenic mouse line. Bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) were generated and used to study the maturation profile of these cells in response to a TLR2 or TLR4 ligand stimulation. CIA was induced by intra-dermal immunization with 100 mug chicken type II collagen in complete Freund's adjuvant on days 0 and 21. CIA incidence and severity was monitored macroscopically and by histology. The T cell profile as well as their cytokine production were analysed by flow cytometry. Lack of beta-catenin specifically in DCs did not affect the spontaneous, TLR2- or TLR4-induced maturation and activation of BMDCs or their cytokine production. Moreover, no effect on the incidence and severity of CIA was observed in mice lacking beta-catenin in CD11c+ cells. A decreased frequency of splenic CD3+CD8+ T cells and of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (CD4+CD25highFoxP3+), but no changes in the frequency of splenic Th17 (CCR6+CXCR3-CCR4+), Th2 (CCR6-CXCR3-CCR4+) and Th1 (CCR6-CXCR3+CCR4-) cells were observed in these mice under CIA condition. Furthermore, the expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-4 or IFNgamma was also not affected. Our data indicate that ablation of beta-catenin expression in DCs did not alter the course and severity of CIA. We conclude that although deletion of beta-catenin resulted in a lower frequency of Tregs, this decrease was not sufficient to aggravate the onset and severity of CIA.

26684240|t|Identification of the BRAF V600E mutation in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
26684240|a|Genomic profiles of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are still insufficiently understood, and the genetic alterations associated with drug responses have not been studied. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center phase II study for pazopanib, and integrated our results with previously published results on pancreas (n = 12) and small intestine NETs (n = 50). The mean numbers of somatic mutations in each case varied widely from 20 to 4682. Among 12 GEP-NETs, eight showed mutations of more than one cancer-related gene, including TP53, CNBD1, RB1, APC, BCOR, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, EP300, ERBB3, KDM6A, KRAS, MGA, MLL3, PTEN, RASA1, SMARCB1, SPEN, TBC1D12, and VHL. TP53 was recurrently mutated in three cases, whereas CNBD1 and RB1 mutations were identified in two cases. Three GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutations demonstrated a durable response and one small intestinal grade (G) 1 NET patient with BRAF V600E mutation showed progression after pazopanib treatment. We found BRAF V600E (G1 NET from rectum and two G3 NETs from colon) and BRAF G593S (G2 NET from pancreas) missense mutations (9.1%) in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NETs from the rectum (n = 26), colon (n = 7), pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 3), stomach (n = 3) and appendix (n = 1) by Sanger sequencing. All tumor specimens were obtained before chemotherapy. In conclusion, BRAF V600E mutation is likely to result in resistance to pazopanib but may be a potentianally actionable mutation in metastatic GEP-NETs patients.

26743002|t|S. cerevisiae Mre11 recruits conjugated SUMO moieties to facilitate the assembly and function of the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex.
26743002|a|Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in chromosomes are the most challenging type of DNA damage. The yeast and mammalian Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 (MRX/N)-Sae2/Ctp1 complex catalyzes the resection of DSBs induced by secondary structures, chemical adducts or covalently-attached proteins. MRX/N also initiates two parallel DNA damage responses-checkpoint phosphorylation and global SUMOylation-to boost a cell's ability to repair DSBs. However, the molecular mechanism of this SUMO-mediated response is not completely known. In this study, we report that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mre11 can non-covalently recruit the conjugated SUMO moieties, particularly the poly-SUMO chain. Mre11 has two evolutionarily-conserved SUMO-interacting motifs, Mre11(SIM1) and Mre11(SIM2), which reside on the outermost surface of Mre11. Mre11(SIM1) is indispensable for MRX assembly. Mre11(SIM2) non-covalently links MRX with the SUMO enzymes (E2/Ubc9 and E3/Siz2) to promote global SUMOylation of DNA repair proteins. Mre11(SIM2) acts independently of checkpoint phosphorylation. During meiosis, the mre11(SIM2) mutant, as for mre11S, rad50S and sae2Delta, allows initiation but not processing of Spo11-induced DSBs. Using MRX and DSB repair as a model, our work reveals a general principle in which the conjugated SUMO moieties non-covalently facilitate the assembly and functions of multi-subunit protein complexes.

26811494|t|Genetic alterations and their clinical implications in gastric cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis revealed by whole-exome sequencing of malignant ascites.
26811494|a|Peritoneal carcinomatosis accompanied by malignant ascites is a major cause of death of advanced gastric cancer (GC). To comprehensively characterize the underlying genomic events involved in GC peritoneal carcinomatosis, we analyzed whole-exome sequences of normal gastric tissues, primary tumors, and malignant ascites from eight GC patients. We identified a unique mutational signature biased toward C-to-A substitutions in malignant ascites. In contrast, the patients who received treatment of adjuvant chemotherapy showed a high rate of C-to-T substitutions along with hypermutation in malignant ascites. Comparative analysis revealed several candidate mutations for GC peritoneal carcinomatosis: recurrent mutations in COL4A6, INTS2, and PTPN13; mutations in druggable genes including TEP1, PRKCD, BRAF, ERBB4, PIK3CA, HDAC9, FYN, FASN, BIRC2, FLT3, ROCK1, CD22, and PIK3C2B; and mutations in metastasis-associated genes including TNFSF12, L1CAM, DIAPH3, ROCK1, TGFBR1, MYO9B, NR4A1, and RHOA. Notably, gene ontology analysis revealed the significant enrichment of mutations in the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway-associated biological processes in malignant ascites. At least four of the eight patients acquired somatic mutations in the Rho-ROCK pathway components, suggesting the possible relevance of this pathway to GC peritoneal carcinomatosis. These results provide a genome-wide molecular understanding of GC peritoneal carcinomatosis and its clinical implications, thereby facilitating the development of effective therapeutics.

26845040|t|Adiponectin Upregulates MiR-133a in Cardiac Hypertrophy through AMPK Activation and Reduced ERK1/2 Phosphorylation.
26845040|a|Adiponectin and miR-133a are key regulators in cardiac hypertrophy. However, whether APN has a potential effect on miR-133a remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether APN could regulate miR-133a expression in Angiotensin II (Ang II) induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Lentiviral-mediated adiponectin treatment attenuated cardiac hypertrophy induced by Ang II infusion in male wistar rats as determined by reduced cell surface area and mRNA levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), also the reduced left ventricular end-diastolic posterior wall thickness (LVPWd) and end-diastolic interventricular septal thickness (IVSd). Meanwhile, APN elevated miR-133a level which was downregulated by Ang II. To further investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we treated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) with recombinant rat APN before Ang II stimulation. Pretreating cells with recombinant APN promoted AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and inhibited ERK activation. By using the inhibitor of AMPK or a lentiviral vector expressing AMPK short hairpin RNA (shRNA) cancelled the positive effect of APN on miR-133a. The ERK inhibitor PD98059 reversed the downregulation of miR-133a induced by Ang II. These results indicated that the AMPK activation and ERK inhibition were responsible for the positive effect of APN on miR-133a. Furthermore, adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) mRNA expression was inhibited by Ang II stimulation. The positive effects of APN on AMPK activation and miR-133a, and the inhibitory effect on ERK phosphorylation were inhibited in NRVMs transfected with lentiviral AdipoR1shRNA. In addition, APN depressed the elevated expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a direct target of miR-133a, through the AMPK pathway. Taken together, our data indicated that APN reversed miR-133a levels through AMPK activation, reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes stimulated with Ang II, revealing a previously undemonstrated and important link between APN and miR-133a.

26934121|t|Reactivation of epigenetically silenced miR-124 reverses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and inhibits invasion in endometrial cancer cells via the direct repression of IQGAP1 expression.
26934121|a|Overexpression of IQGAP1 and microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation are frequent in human tumors, but little is known about the role of IQGAP1 and its relationship to miRNA in endometrial carcinogenesis. We demonstrate that IQGAP1 activates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program and that miR-124 directly represses IQGAP1 expression in endometrial cancer (EC) cells. The overexpression of IQGAP1 stimulates EMT features and enhances migration, invasion and proliferation of EC cells, whereas knocking down IQGAP1 expression reverses EMT and inhibits these malignant properties. Using miRNA microarray profiling, we identified 29 miRNAs (let-7b, let-7f, miR-10b, miR-15b, miR-23a, miR-24, miR-25, miR-27a, miR-29b, miR-30a-5p, miR-34a, miR-124, miR-127, miR-130b, miR-148a, miR-155, miR-191*, miR-194, miR-224, miR-362, miR-409-3p, miR-422b, miR-424, miR-453, miR-497, miR-518d, miR-518f*, miR-526a and miR-656) that are significantly down-regulated in an in vitro-selected highly invasive derivative cell line (HEC-50-HI) relative to the parental HEC-50 cells. We further identified miR-124 as a direct regulator of IQGAP1 in EC cells. Enforced expression of miR-124 suppresses EC cell invasion and proliferation. The expression of IQGAP1 mRNA was significantly elevated in EC tissues, while the expression of miR-124 was decreased. The downregulation of miR-124 correlates with a poor survival outcome for patients with EC. Treating EC cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increased miR-124 expression and down-regulated IQGAP1 levels. Our data suggest that IQGAP1 promotes EMT, migration and invasion of EC cells. MiR-124, a novel tumor suppressor miRNA that is epigenetically silenced in EC, can reverse EMT and the invasive properties, by attenuating the expression of the IQGAP1 oncogene.

26969755|t|Bacterial DNA Protects Monocytic Cells against HIV-Vpr-Induced Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization.
26969755|a|Monocytes and macrophages are important HIV reservoirs, as they exhibit marked resistance to apoptosis upon infection. However, the mechanism underlying resistance to apoptosis in these cells is poorly understood. Using HIV-viral protein R-52-96 aa peptide (Vpr), we show that primary monocytes and THP-1 cells treated with Vpr are highly susceptible to mitochondrial depolarization, but develop resistance following stimulation with bacterial DNA or CpG oligodeoxynucleotide. We have shown that Vpr-induced mitochondrial depolarization is mediated by TNFR-associated factor-1 (TRAF-1) and TRAF-2 degradation and subsequent activation of caspase-8, Bid, and Bax. To provide the mechanism governing such resistance to mitochondrial depolarization, our results show that prior stimulation with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide or Escherichia coli DNA prevented: 1) TRAF-1/2 downregulation; 2) activation of caspase-8, Bid, and Bax; and 3) subsequent mitochondrial depolarization and release of apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochrome c Furthermore, this protection was mediated by upregulation of antiapoptotic protein (c-IAP-2) through calmodulin-dependent kinase-II activation. Thus, c-IAP-2 may prevent Vpr-mediated mitochondrial depolarization through stabilizing TRAF-1/2 expression and sequential inhibition of caspase-8, Bid, and Bax.

27050163|t|Knockdown of Carboxypeptidase A6 in Zebrafish Larvae Reduces Response to Seizure-Inducing Drugs and Causes Changes in the Level of mRNAs Encoding Signaling Molecules.
27050163|a|Carboxypeptidase A6 (CPA6) is an extracellular matrix metallocarboxypeptidase that modulates peptide and protein function by removal of hydrophobic C-terminal amino acids. Mutations in the human CPA6 gene that reduce enzymatic activity in the extracellular matrix are associated with febrile seizures, temporal lobe epilepsy, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The characterization of these human mutations suggests a dominant mode of inheritance by haploinsufficiency through loss of function mutations, however the total number of humans with pathologic mutations in CPA6 identified to date remains small. To better understand the relationship between CPA6 and seizures we investigated the effects of morpholino knockdown of cpa6 mRNA in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae. Knockdown of cpa6 mRNA resulted in resistance to the effect of seizure-inducing drugs pentylenetetrazole and pilocarpine on swimming behaviors. Knockdown of cpa6 mRNA also reduced the levels of mRNAs encoding neuropeptide precursors (bdnf, npy, chga, pcsk1nl, tac1, nts, edn1), a neuropeptide processing enzyme (cpe), transcription factor (c-fos), and molecules implicated in glutamatergic signaling (grin1a and slc1a2b). Treatment of zebrafish embryos with 60 mM pilocarpine for 1 hour led to reductions in levels of many of the same mRNAs when measured 1 day after pilocarpine exposure, except for c-fos which was elevated 1 day after pilocarpine treatment. Pilocarpine treatment, like cpa6 knockdown, led to a reduced sensitivity to pentylenetetrazole when tested 1 day after pilocarpine treatment. Taken together, these results add to mounting evidence that peptidergic systems participate in the biological effects of seizure-inducing drugs, and are the first in vivo demonstration of the molecular and behavioral consequences of cpa6 insufficiency.

27172902|t|Cisplatin induces tolerogenic dendritic cells in response to TLR agonists via the abundant production of IL-10, thereby promoting Th2- and Tr1-biased T-cell immunity.
27172902|a|Although many advantageous roles of cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II), CDDP) have been reported in cancer therapy, the immunomodulatory roles of cisplatin in the phenotypic and functional alterations of dendritic cells (DCs) are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of cisplatin on the functionality of DCs and the changes in signaling pathways activated upon toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Cisplatin-treated DCs down-regulated the expression of cell surface molecules (CD80, CD86, MHC class I and II) and up-regulated endocytic capacity in a dose-dependent manner. Upon stimulation with various TLR agonists, cisplatin-treated DCs showed markedly increased IL-10 production through activation of the p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways without altering the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-12p70, indicating the cisplatin-mediated induction of tolerogenic DCs. This effect was dependent on the production of IL-10 from DCs, as neither DCs isolated from IL-10-/- mice nor IL-10-neutralized DCs generated tolerogenic DCs. Interestingly, DCs that were co-treated with cisplatin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exhibited a decreased immunostimulatory capacity for inducing the proliferation of Th1- and Th17-type T cells; instead, these DCs contributed to Th2-type T cell immunity. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo investigations revealed a unique T cell population, IL-10-producing CD3+CD4+LAG-3+CD49b+CD25-Foxp3- Tr1 cells, that was significantly increased without altering the Foxp3+ regulatory T cell population. Taken together, our results suggest that cisplatin induces immune-suppressive tolerogenic DCs in TLR agonist-induced inflammatory conditions via abundant IL-10 production, thereby skewing Th cell differentiation towards Th2 and Tr1 cells. This relationship may provide cancer cells with an opportunity to evade the immune system.

27230238|t|RhBMP-2 Activates Hippo Signaling through RASSF1 in Esophageal Cancer Cells.
27230238|a|Despite that recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) has been reported as a stimulatory effecter of cancer cell growth because of its characteristic like morphogen, the biological functions of rhBMP-2 in human esophageal cancer cells are unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether rhBMP-2 has an inhibitory effect on the growth of human esophageal squamous carcinoma cells (ESCC). RhBMP-2 significantly inhibited proliferation of ESCC cells in a dose-dependent manner in the MTT assay. Cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase was induced 24 h after rhBMP2 treatment. RhBMP-2 also reduced cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK 6 activities, and stimulated p-Smad1/5/8, p53, and p21 levels at 12 h. In contrast, rhBMP-2 diminished poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein expression levels and activated cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-7, and cleaved-caspase 9 levels in ESCC cells. In addition, rhBMP-2 increased MST1, MOB1, and p-YAP protein levels and the RASSF1 binds Mst1 more upon treatment with rhBMP2. The induced p-YAP expression in TE-8 and TE-12 cells by rhBMP-2 was reversed by the RASSF1 knockdown. In vivo study, rhBMP-2 decreased tumor volume following subcutaneous implantation and showed higher radiologic score (less bony destruction) after femoral implantation compared to those in a control group. These results suggest that rhBMP-2 inhibits rather than activates proliferation of human esophageal cancer cells which is mediated through activating the hippo signaling pathway.

27464336|t|Decreased Whole-Body Fat Mass Produced by Chronic Alcohol Consumption is Associated with Activation of S6K1-Mediated Protein Synthesis and Increased Autophagy in Epididymal White Adipose Tissue.
27464336|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to a loss of white adipose tissue (WAT) but the underlying mechanisms for this lipodystrophy are not fully elucidated. This study tested the hypothesis that the reduction in WAT mass in chronic alcohol-fed mice is associated with a decreased protein synthesis specifically related to impaired function of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). METHODS: Adult male mice were provided an alcohol-containing liquid diet for 24 weeks or an isonitrogenous isocaloric control diet. In vivo protein synthesis was determined at this time and thereafter epididymal WAT (eWAT) was excised for analysis of signal transduction pathways central to controling protein synthesis and degradation. RESULTS: While chronic alcohol feeding decreased whole-body and eWAT mass, this was associated with a discordant increase in protein synthesis in eWAT. This increase was not associated with a change in mTOR, 4E-BP1, Akt, or PRAS40 phosphorylation. Instead, a selective increase in phosphorylation of S6K1 and its downstream substrates, S6 and eIF4B was detected in alcohol-fed mice. Alcohol also increased eEF2K phosphorylation and decreased eEF2 phosphorylation consistent with increased translation elongation. Alcohol increased Atg12-5, LC3B-I and -II, and ULK1 S555 phosphorylation, suggesting increased autophagy, while markers of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 and -9, and PARP) were unchanged. Lipolytic enzymes (ATGL and HSL phosphorylation) were increased and lipogenic regulators (PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha) were decreased in eWAT by alcohol. Although alcohol increased TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta mRNA, no change in key components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, ACS, and cleaved caspase-1) was detected suggesting alcohol did not increase pyroptosis. Plasma insulin did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the alcohol-induced decrease in whole-body fat mass resulted in part from activation of autophagy in eWAT as protein synthesis was increased and mediated by the specific increase in the activity of S6K1.

27470968|t|PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade Enhances T-cell Activity and Antitumor Efficacy of Imatinib in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors.
27470968|a|PURPOSE: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) but often are of transient benefit as resistance commonly develops. Immunotherapy, particularly blockade of the inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1) or the ligand programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), has shown effectiveness in a variety of cancers. The functional effects of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade are unknown in GISTs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed tumor and matched blood samples from 85 patients with GISTs and determined the expression of immune checkpoint molecules using flow cytometry. We investigated the combination of imatinib with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in KitV558Delta/+ mice that develop GISTs. RESULTS: The inhibitory receptors PD-1, lymphocyte activation gene 3, and T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 were upregulated on tumor-infiltrating T cells compared with T cells from matched blood. PD-1 expression on T cells was highest in imatinib-treated human GISTs. Meanwhile, intratumoral PD-L1 expression was variable. In human GIST cell lines, treatment with imatinib abrogated the IFNgamma-induced upregulation of PD-L1 via STAT1 inhibition. In KitV558Delta/+ mice, imatinib downregulated IFNgamma-related genes and reduced PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade in vivo each had no efficacy alone but enhanced the antitumor effects of imatinib by increasing T-cell effector function in the presence of KIT and IDO inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is a promising strategy to improve the effects of targeted therapy in GISTs. Collectively, our results provide the rationale to combine these agents in human GISTs.

27542238|t|A steroid like phytochemical Antcin M is an anti-aging reagent that eliminates hyperglycemia-accelerated premature senescence in dermal fibroblasts by direct activation of Nrf2 and SIRT-1.
27542238|a|The present study revealed the anti-aging properties of antcin M (ANM) and elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying the effects. We found that exposure of human normal dermal fibroblasts (HNDFs) to high-glucose (HG, 30 mM) for 3 days, accelerated G0/G1 phase arrest and senescence. Indeed, co-treatment with ANM (10 microM) significantly attenuated HG-induced growth arrest and promoted cell proliferation. Further molecular analysis revealed that ANM blocked the HG-induced reduction in G1-S transition regulatory proteins such as cyclin D, cyclin E, CDK4, CDK6, CDK2 and protein retinoblastoma (pRb). In addition, treatment with ANM eliminated HG-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the induction of anti-oxidant genes, HO-1 and NQO-1 via transcriptional activation of Nrf2. Moreover, treatment with ANM abolished HG-induced SIPS as evidenced by reduced senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activity. This effect was further confirmed by reduction in senescence-associated marker proteins including, p21CIP1, p16INK4A, and p53/FoxO1 acetylation. Also, the HG-induced decline in aging-related marker protein SMP30 was rescued by ANM. Furthermore, treatment with ANM increased SIRT-1 expression, and prevented SIRT-1 depletion. This protection was consistent with inhibition of SIRT-1 phosphorylation at Ser47 followed by blocking its upstream kinases, p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK. Further analysis revealed that ANM partially protected HG-induced senescence in SIRT-1 silenced cells. A similar effect was also observed in Nrf2 silenced cells. However, a complete loss of protection was observed in both Nrf2 and SIRT-1 knockdown cells suggesting that both induction of Nrf2-mediated anti-oxidant defense and SIRT-1-mediated deacetylation activity contribute to the anti-aging properties of ANM in vitro. Result of in vivo studies shows that ANM-treated C. elegens exhibits an increased survival rate during HG-induced oxidative stress insult. Furthermore, ANM significantly extended the life span of C. elegans. Taken together, our results suggest the potential application of ANM in age-related diseases or as a preventive reagent against aging process.

27640183|t|Erythropoietin does not activate erythropoietin receptor signaling or lipolytic pathways in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue in vivo.
27640183|a|BACKGROUND: Erythropoietin (Epo) exerts direct effects on white adipose tissue (WAT) in mice in addition to its erythropoietic effects, and in humans Epo increases resting energy expenditure and affect serum lipid levels, but direct effects of Epo in human WAT have not been documented. We therefore investigated the effects of acute and prolonged Epo exposure on human WAT in vivo. METHOD: Data were obtained from two clinical trials: 1) acute Epo exposure (rHuEpo, 400 IU/kg) followed by WAT biopsies after 1 h and 2) 10 weeks treatment with the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) Darbepoietin-alpha. Biopsies were analyzed by PCR for Epo receptor (Epo-R) mRNA. A new and highly specific antibody (A82, Amgen) was used to evaluate the presence of Epo-R by western blot analysis in addition to Epo-R signaling proteins (Akt, STAT5, p70s6k, LYN, and p38MAPK), activation of lipolytic pathways (ATGL, HSL, CGI-58, G0S2, Perilipin, Cidea, Cidec, AMPK, and ACC), and mitochondrial biogenesis (VDAC, HSP90, PDH, and SDHA). RESULTS: No evidence of in vivo activation of the Epo-R in WAT could be documented despite detectable levels of Epo-R mRNA. CONCLUSION: Thus, in contradiction to animal studies, Epo treatment within a physiological relevant range in humans does not exert direct effects in a subcutaneous WAT.

27930654|t|Whole-Organism Developmental Expression Profiling Identifies RAB-28 as a Novel Ciliary GTPase Associated with the BBSome and Intraflagellar Transport.
27930654|a|Primary cilia are specialised sensory and developmental signalling devices extending from the surface of most eukaryotic cells. Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders (ciliopathies) such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), frequently affecting many physiological and developmental processes across multiple organs. Cilium formation, maintenance and function depend on intracellular transport systems such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dynein motors and regulated by the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) cargo-adaptor protein complex, or BBSome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis when most sensory neurons differentiate. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161 (FAM161A orthologue), CCDC-104 (CCDC104), and RPI-1 (RP1/RP1L1), which we confirm are cilium-localised in worms. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we uncover orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analyses of C. elegans RAB-28, recently associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. Whereas inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localisation, GTP-bound (activated) RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses reveal that whilst cilium structure, sensory function and IFT are seemingly normal in a rab-28 null allele, overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB-28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function. Collectively, our findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins, and unveil RAB28, a GTPase most closely related to the BBS protein RABL4/IFT27, as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.

27974047|t|FGFR1 and NTRK3 actionable alterations in "Wild-Type" gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
27974047|a|BACKGROUND: About 10-15% of adult, and most pediatric, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) lack mutations in KIT, PDGFRA, SDHx, or RAS pathway components (KRAS, BRAF, NF1). The identification of additional mutated genes in this rare subset of tumors can have important clinical benefit to identify altered biological pathways and select targeted therapies. METHODS: We performed comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) for coding regions in more than 300 cancer-related genes of 186 GISTs to assess for their somatic alterations. RESULTS: We identified 24 GIST lacking alterations in the canonical KIT/PDGFRA/RAS pathways, including 12 without SDHx alterations. These 24 patients were mostly adults (96%). The tumors had a 46% rate of nodal metastases. These 24 GIST were more commonly mutated at 7 genes: ARID1B, ATR, FGFR1, LTK, SUFU, PARK2 and ZNF217. Two tumors harbored FGFR1 gene fusions (FGFR1-HOOK3, FGFR1-TACC1) and one harbored an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion that responded to TRK inhibition. In an independent sample set, we identified 5 GIST cases lacking alterations in the KIT/PDGFRA/SDHx/RAS pathways, including two additional cases with FGFR1-TACC1 and ETV6-NTRK3 fusions. CONCLUSIONS: Using patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and CGP, we show that GIST lacking alterations in canonical genes occur in younger patients, frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, and most contain deleterious genomic alterations, including gene fusions involving FGFR1 and NTRK3. If confirmed in larger series, routine testing for these translocations may be indicated for this subset of GIST. Moreover, these findings can be used to guide personalized treatments for patients with GIST. Trial registration NCT 02576431. Registered October 12, 2015.

28237856|t|Wogonin, a plant derived small molecule, exerts potent anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects through the activation of ROS/ERK/Nrf2 signaling pathways in human Osteoarthritis chondrocytes.
28237856|a|Osteoarthritis (OA), characterized by progressive destruction of articular cartilage, is the most common form of human arthritis. Here, we evaluated the potential chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of Wogonin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, in IL-1beta-stimulated human OA chondrocytes and cartilage explants. Wogonin completely suppressed the expression and production of inflammatory mediators including IL-6, COX-2, PGE2, iNOS and NO in IL-1beta-stimulated OA chondrocytes. Further, Wogonin exhibits potent chondroprotective potential by switching the signaling axis of matrix degradation from catabolic towards anabolic ends and inhibited the expression, production and activities of matrix degrading proteases including MMP-13, MMP-3, MMP-9, and ADAMTS-4 in OA chondrocytes, and blocked the release of s-GAG and COL2A1 in IL-1beta-stimulated OA cartilage explants. Wogonin also elevated the expression of cartilage anabolic factors COL2A1 and ACAN in chondrocytes and inhibited the IL-1beta-mediated depletion of COL2A1 and proteoglycan content in the matrix of cartilage explants. The suppressive effect of Wogonin was not mediated through the inhibition of MAPKs or NF-kappaB activation. Instead, Wogonin induced mild oxidative stress through the generation of ROS and depletion of cellular GSH, thereby modulating the cellular redox leading to the induction of Nrf2/ARE pathways through activation of ROS/ERK/Nrf2/HO-1-SOD2-NQO1-GCLC signaling axis in OA chondrocytes. Molecular docking studies revealed that Wogonin can disrupt KEAP-1/Nrf-2 interaction by directly blocking the binding site of Nrf-2 in the KEAP-1 protein. Genetic ablation of Nrf2 using specific siRNA, significantly abrogated the anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective potential of Wogonin in IL-1beta-stimulated OA chondrocytes. Our data indicates that Wogonin exerts chondroprotective effects through the suppression of molecular events involved in oxidative stress, inflammation and matrix degradation in OA chondrocytes and cartilage explants. The study provides novel insights into the development of Nrf2 as a promising candidate and Wogonin as a therapeutic agent for the management of OA.

28242692|t|LEM2 recruits CHMP7 for ESCRT-mediated nuclear envelope closure in fission yeast and human cells.
28242692|a|Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport III (ESCRT-III) proteins have been implicated in sealing the nuclear envelope in mammals, spindle pole body dynamics in fission yeast, and surveillance of defective nuclear pore complexes in budding yeast. Here, we report that Lem2p (LEM2), a member of the LEM (Lap2-Emerin-Man1) family of inner nuclear membrane proteins, and the ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein Cmp7p (CHMP7), work together to recruit additional ESCRT-III proteins to holes in the nuclear membrane. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, deletion of the ATPase vps4 leads to severe defects in nuclear morphology and integrity. These phenotypes are suppressed by loss-of-function mutations that arise spontaneously in lem2 or cmp7, implying that these proteins may function upstream in the same pathway. Building on these genetic interactions, we explored the role of LEM2 during nuclear envelope reformation in human cells. We found that CHMP7 and LEM2 enrich at the same region of the chromatin disk periphery during this window of cell division and that CHMP7 can bind directly to the C-terminal domain of LEM2 in vitro. We further found that, during nuclear envelope formation, recruitment of the ESCRT factors CHMP7, CHMP2A, and IST1/CHMP8 all depend on LEM2 in human cells. We conclude that Lem2p/LEM2 is a conserved nuclear site-specific adaptor that recruits Cmp7p/CHMP7 and downstream ESCRT factors to the nuclear envelope.

28255270|t|Activated ClC-2 Inhibits p-Akt to Repress Myelination in GDM Newborn Rats.
28255270|a|This study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of type 2 voltage-gated chloride channel (ClC-2) on myelin development of newborn rats' cerebral white matter with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In this study, GDM model was induced in late pregnant rat model. The alteration of ClC-2 expression in various developmental stages of cerebral white matter with/without being exposed to high glucose was analyzed using RT-PCR, active oxygen detection, TUNEL staining, Western Blot as well as immuno-histochemical staining. Our results showed that ClC-2 mRNA and protein expressions in GDM group were significantly increased in white matter of fetal rats after E18 stage, and elevated the level of TNF-alpha and iNOS in white matter at P0 and P3 stage of newborn rats. Meanwhile, In GDM group, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of the white matter at E18, P0, and P3 stage were significantly higher than control group. Furthermore, the expression level of myelin transcription factor Olig2 at P0 stage and CNPase at P3 stage were strikingly lower than that of the control group. In GDM group, ClC-2 expression in the corpus callosum (CC) and cingulate gyrus (CG) regains, and TUNEL positive cell number were increased at P0 and P3 stage. However, PDGFalpha positive cell number at P0 stage and CNPase expression at P3 stage were significantly decreased. Caspase-3 was also increased in those white matter regions in GDM group, but p-Akt expression was inhibited. While DIDS (a chloride channel blocker) can reverse these changes. In conclusion, ClC-2 and caspase-3 were induced by GDM, which resulted in apoptosis and myelination inhibition. The effect was caused by repressing PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Application of ClC-2 inhibitor DIDS showed protective effects on cerebral white matter damage stimulated by high glucose concentration.

28359799|t|Paxillin and embryonic PolyAdenylation Binding Protein (ePABP) engage to regulate androgen-dependent Xenopus laevis oocyte maturation - A model of kinase-dependent regulation of protein expression.
28359799|a|Steroid-triggered Xenopus laevis oocyte maturation is an elegant physiologic model of nongenomic steroid signaling, as it proceeds completely independent of transcription. We previously demonstrated that androgens are the main physiologic stimulator of oocyte maturation in Xenopus oocytes, and that the adaptor protein paxillin plays a crucial role in mediating this process through a positive feedback loop in which paxillin first enhances Mos protein translation, ensued by Erk2 activation and Erk-dependent phosphorylation of paxillin on serine residues. Phosphoserine-paxillin then further augments Mos protein translation and downstream Erk2 activation, resulting in meiotic progression. We hypothesized that paxillin enhances Mos translation by interacting with embryonic PolyAdenylation Binding Protein (ePABP) on polyadenylated Mos mRNA. Knockdown of ePABP phenocopied paxillin knockdown, with reduced Mos protein expression, Erk2 and Cdk1 activation, as well as oocyte maturation. In both Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells (HEK-293), paxillin and ePABP constitutively interacted. Testosterone (Xenopus) or EGF (HEK-293) augmented ePABP-paxillin binding, as well as ePABP binding to Mos mRNA (Xenopus), in an Erk-dependent fashion. Thus, ePABP and paxillin work together in an Erk-dependent fashion to enhance Mos protein translation and promote oocyte maturation.

28387445|t|Stimulation of oral fibroblast chemokine receptors identifies CCR3 and CCR4 as potential wound healing targets.
28387445|a|The focus of this study was to determine which chemokine receptors are present on oral fibroblasts and whether these receptors influence proliferation, migration, and/or the release of wound healing mediators. This information may provide insight into the superior wound healing characteristics of the oral mucosa. The gingiva fibroblasts expressed 12 different chemokine receptors (CCR3, CCR4, CCR6, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR4, CXCR5, CXCR7, CX3CR1, and XCR1), as analyzed by flow cytometry. Fourteen corresponding chemokines (CCL5, CCL15, CCL20, CCL22, CCL25, CCL27, CCL28, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL11, CXCL12, CXCL13, CX3CL1, and XCL1) were used to study the activation of these receptors on gingiva fibroblasts. Twelve of these fourteen chemokines stimulated gingiva fibroblast migration (all except for CXCL8 and CXCL12). Five of the chemokines stimulated proliferation (CCL5/CCR3, CCL15/CCR3, CCL22/CCR4, CCL28/CCR3/CCR10, and XCL1/XCR1). Furthermore, CCL28/CCR3/CCR10 and CCL22/CCR4 stimulation increased IL-6 secretion and CCL28/CCR3/CCR10 together with CCL27/CCR10 upregulated HGF secretion. Moreover, TIMP-1 secretion was reduced by CCL15/CCR3. In conclusion, this in-vitro study identifies chemokine receptor-ligand pairs which may be used in future targeted wound healing strategies. In particular, we identified the chemokine receptors CCR3 and CCR4, and the mucosa specific chemokine CCL28, as having an predominant role in oral wound healing by increasing human gingiva fibroblast proliferation, migration, and the secretion of IL-6 and HGF and reducing the secretion of TIMP-1.

28408751|t|MMP9 integrates multiple immunoregulatory pathways that discriminate high suppressive activity of human mesenchymal stem cells.
28408751|a|The mechanisms underlying mesenchymal stem cells' (MSC) suppressive potency are largely unknown. We here show that highly suppressive human adipose tissue-derived MSC (AdMSC) display and induce a differential immunologic profile, upon ongoing AdMSC suppressive activity, promoting: (i) early correlated inhibition of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production, along IL-10 increase, (ii) CD73+Foxp3+Treg subset expansion, and (iii) specific correlations between gene expression increases, such as: MMP9 correlated with CCL22, TNF, FASL, RUNX3, and SEMAD4 in AdMSC and, in T cells, MMP9 upregulation correlated with CCR4, IL4 and TBX21, among others, whereas MMP2 correlated with BCL2 and LRRC31. MMP9 emerged as an integrating molecule for both AdMSC and T cells in molecular networks built with our gene expression data, and we confirmed upregulation of MMP9 and MMP2 at the protein level, in AdMSC and T cells, respectively. MMP2/9 inhibition significantly decreased AdMSC suppressive effect, confirming their important role in suppressive acitivity. We conclude that MMP9 and 2 are robust new players involved in human MSC immunoregulatory mechanisms, and the higher suppressive activity correlates to their capacity to trigger a coordinated action of multiple specific molecules, mobilizing various immunoregulatory mechanisms.

28430985|t|Arabidopsis CP12 mutants have reduced levels of phosphoribulokinase and impaired function of the Calvin-Benson cycle.
28430985|a|CP12 is a small, redox-sensitive protein, the most detailed understanding of which is the thioredoxin-mediated regulation of the Calvin-Benson cycle, where it facilitates the formation of a complex between glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) in response to changes in light intensity. In most organisms, CP12 proteins are encoded by small multigene families, where the importance of each individual CP12 gene in vivo has not yet been reported. We used Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA mutants and RNAi transgenic lines with reduced levels of CP12 transcript to determine the relative importance of each of the CP12 genes. We found that single cp12-1, cp12-2, and cp12-3 mutants do not develop a severe photosynthetic or growth phenotype. In contrast, reductions of both CP12-1 and CP12-2 transcripts lead to reductions in photosynthetic capacity and to slower growth and reduced seed yield. No clear phenotype for CP12-3 was evident. Additionally, the levels of PRK protein are reduced in the cp12-1, cp12-1/2, and multiple mutants. Our results suggest that there is functional redundancy between CP12-1 and CP12-2 in Arabidopsis where these proteins have a role in determining the level of PRK in mature leaves and hence photosynthetic capacity.

28472177|t|Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1) is associated with stem-like cancer cell functions in pediatric high-grade glioma.
28472177|a|Pediatric high-grade gliomas represent 8-12% of all primary tumors of the nervous system in children. Five-year survival for these pediatric aggressive tumors is poor (15-35%) indicating the need to develop better treatments for pediatric high-grade gliomas. In this work we used SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cell lines to study the function of the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1), a deubiquitinase de-regulated in several cancers, in pediatric high-grade gliomas. UCHL1 depletion in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 glioma cells was associated with decreased cell proliferation and invasion, along with a reduced ability to grow in soft agar and to form spheres (i.e. self-renewal measure). A 70% reduction in Wnt signaling was also observed in the SF188 and SJ-GBM2 UCHL1 knockdowns (KDs) using a TCF-dependent TOPflash reporter assay. Transcriptome comparisons of UCHL1 KDs versus vector control identified a list of 306 differentially expressed genes (at least 2-fold change; p    <0.05) which included genes known to be involved in cancer like ACTA2, POSTN, LIF, FBXL7, FBXW11, GDF15, HEY2, but also potential novel genes such us IGLL5, ABCA4, AQP3, AQP4, CALB1, and ALK. Bioinformatics gene ontology (GO) analysis of these 306 genes revealed significant enrichment in "signal peptides", "extracellular matrix"and "secreted proteins" GO Terms. "Angiogenesis and blood vessel development", "neuron differentiation/development", cell adhesion", and "cell migration" also showed significant enrichment in our GO analysis. Top canonical pathways identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) included "Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis Signaling" (p = 5.14x10-4), "Virus Entry via Endocytic Pathways" (p = 6.15x 10-4), and "High Mobility Group-Box 1 (HMGB1) Signaling" (p = 6.15x10-4). While FGF2, IL1B, TNF and PDGFB were predicted as top upstream regulators (p    < 2x10-16) of the UCHL1 KD-associated transcriptome. Aberrant expression of UCHL1 in pediatric high-grade gliomas may promote cell invasion, transformation, and self-renewal properties, at least in part, by modulating Wnt/Beta catenin activity. UCHL1 might act as an oncogene in glioma within the gene network that imparts stem-like characteristics to these cancer cells.

28472949|t|Distinct gene expression profiles associated with Notch ligands Delta-like 4 and Jagged1 in plaque material from peripheral artery disease patients: a pilot study.
28472949|a|BACKGROUND: The lack of early diagnosis, progression markers and effective pharmacological treatment has dramatic unfavourable effects on clinical outcomes in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Addressing these issues will require dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. We sought to characterize the Notch signaling and atherosclerosis relevant markers in lesions from femoral arteries of symptomatic PAD patients. METHODS: Plaque material from the common femoral, superficial femoral or popliteal arteries of 20 patients was removed by directional atherectomy. RNA was obtained from 9 out of 20 samples and analysed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: We detected expression of Notch ligands Delta-like 4 (Dll4) and Jagged1 (Jag1), of Notch target genes Hes1, Hey1, Hey2, HeyL and of markers of plaque inflammation and stability such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), smooth muscle 22 (SM22), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), Bcl2, CD68 and miRNAs 21-5p, 125a-5p, 126-5p,146-5p, 155-5p, 424-5p. We found an "inflamed plaque" gene expression profile characterized by high Dll4 associated to medium/high CD68, COX2, VCAM1, Hes1, miR126-5p, miR146a-5p, miR155-5p, miR424-5p and low Jag1, SM22, Bcl2, Hey2, HeyL, miR125a-5p (2/9 patients) and a "stable plaque" profile characterized by high Jag1 associated to medium/high Hey2, HeyL, SM22, Bcl2, miR125a and low Dll4, CD68, COX2, VCAM1, miR126-5p, miR146a-5p, miR155-5p, miR424-5p (3/9 patients). The remaining patients (4/9) showed a plaque profile with intermediate characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the existence of a gene signature associated to Notch activation by specific ligands that could be predictive of PAD progression.

28512644|t|Analysis of Serum Cytokines and Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms of SOD1, SOD2, and CAT in Erysipelas Patients.
28512644|a|Increased free radical production had been documented in group A (beta-hemolytic) streptococcus infection cases. Comparing 71 erysipelas patients to 55 age-matched healthy individuals, we sought for CAT, SOD1, and SOD2 single polymorphism mutation (SNPs) interactions with erysipelas' predisposition and serum cytokine levels in the acute and recovery phases of erysipelas infection. Whereas female patients had a higher predisposition to erysipelas, male patients were prone to having a facial localization of the infection. The presence of SOD1 G7958, SOD2 T2734, and CAT C262 alleles was linked to erysipelas' predisposition. T and C alleles of SOD2 T2734C individually were linked to patients with bullous and erythematous erysipelas, respectively. G and A alleles of SOD1 G7958A individually were associated with lower limbs and higher body part localizations of the infection, respectively. Serum levels of IL-1beta, CCL11, IL-2Ralpha, CXCL9, TRAIL, PDGF-BB, and CCL4 were associated with symptoms accompanying the infection, while IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF, and VEGF were associated with predisposition and recurrence of erysipelas. While variations of IL-1beta, IL-7, IL-8, IL-17, CCL5, and HGF were associated with the SOD2 T2734C SNP, variations of PDFG-BB and CCL2 were associated with the CAT C262T SNP.

28518143|t|Calcium sensing receptor protects high glucose-induced energy metabolism disorder via blocking gp78-ubiquitin proteasome pathway.
28518143|a|Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major complication and fatal cause of the patients with diabetes. The calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor, which is involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis, regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, and so on. In our previous study, we found that CaSR expression, intracellular calcium levels and cardiac function were all significantly decreased in DCM rats; however, the exact mechanism are not clear yet. The present study revealed the protective role of CaSR in myocardial energy metabolism disorder induced by high glucose (HG) as well as the underlying mechanism. Here, we demonstrated that HG decreased the expression of CaSR, mitochondrial fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2), cell gap junction related proteins (Cx43, beta-catenin, N-cadherin), and intracellular ATP concentration. In contrast, HG increased extracellular ATP concentration, the expression of gp78, mitochondrial fission proteins (Fis1, Drp1), and the ubiquitination levels of Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43. Moreover, CaSR agonist and gp78-siRNA significantly reduced the above changes. Taken together, these results suggest that HG induces myocardial energy metabolism disorder via decrease of CaSR expression, and activation of gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system. In turn, these effects disrupt the structure and function of the mitochondria and the cell gap junction, result in the reduced ATP synthesis and the increased ATP leakage. Stimulation of CaSR significantly attenuates HG-induced abnormal myocardial energy metabolism, suggesting CaSR would be a promising potential therapeutic target for DCM.

28846666|t|Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha) Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), Inflammation and Metabolism in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Inner Mongolia.
28846666|a|BACKGROUND Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is common all over the world. GDM women are with inflammatory and metabolisms abnormalities. However, few studies have focused on the association of IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha -857C/T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), inflammatory biomarkers, and metabolic indexes in women with GDM, especially in the Inner Mongolia population. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha -857C/T SNPs, and inflammation and metabolic biomarkers in women with GDM pregnancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS Blood samples and placentas from 140 women with GDM and 140 women with healthy pregnancies were collected. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and MassARRAY-IPLEX were performed to analyze IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha -857C/T SNPs. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to analyze inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines. RESULTS Distribution frequency of TNF-alpha -857CT (OR=3.316, 95% CI=1.092-8.304, p=0.025) in women with GDM pregnancies were obviously higher than that in women with healthy pregnancies. Women with GDM were of older maternal age, had higher BMI, were more nulliparous, and had T2DM and GDM history, compared to women with healthy pregnancies (p   <0.05). Inflammatory biomarkers in serum (hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, IL-6/IL-10 ratio) and placental (NF-kappaB, IL-6, IL-8, IL-6/IL-10 ratio, IL-1b, TNF-alpha) were significantly different (p   <0.05) between women with GDM and women with healthy pregnancies. Differences were found for serum FBG, FINS, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-beta, and placental IRS-1, IRS-2, leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, RBP-4, chemerin, nesfatin-1, FATP-4, EL, LPL, FABP-1, FABP-3, FABP-4, and FABP-5. CONCLUSIONS TNF-alpha -857C/T SNP, hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-6/IL-10 were associated with GDM in women from Inner Mongolia, as was serious inflammation and disordered lipid and glucose metabolisms.

29136006|t|Lipopolysaccharide potentiates platelet responses via toll-like receptor 4-stimulated Akt-Erk-PLA2 signalling.
29136006|a|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a principal cause of the symptoms of sepsis. LPS has been reported to modulate the function of platelets although the underlying mechanisms of LPS action in these cells remain unclear. Platelets express the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) which serves as a receptor for LPS, although the potential role of TLR4 and associated cell signalling in controlling platelet responses to LPS has not been extensively explored. In this study, we therefore investigated the actions of LPS prepared from different strains of Escherichia coli on platelet function, the underlying signalling mechanisms, and the potential role of TLR4 in orchestrating these. We report that LPS increased the aggregation of washed platelets stimulated by thromboxane (U46619) or GPVI collagen receptor agonists, effects that were prevented by a TLR4 antagonist. Associated with this, LPS enhanced fibrinogen binding, P-selectin exposure and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release. Increase of ROS was found to be important for the actions of LPS on platelets, since these were inhibited in the presence of superoxide dismutase or catalase. The effects of LPS were associated with phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2 and PLA2 in stimulated platelets, and inhibitors of PI3-kinase, Akt and ERK1/2 reduced significantly LPS enhanced platelet function and associated ROS production. Furthermore, inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase or the thromboxane receptor, revealed an important role for thromboxane A2. We therefore conclude that LPS increases human platelet activation through a TLR4-PI3K-Akt-ERK1/2-PLA2 -dependent pathway that is dependent on ROS and TXA2 formation.

29845292|t|Regulation of TLR4 expression mediates the attenuating effect of erythropoietin on inflammation and myocardial fibrosis in rat heart.
29845292|a|The mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory or antifibrotic activity of erythropoietin (EPO) in myocardial fibrosis (MF) remains elusive. In the current study, abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) was performed on rats and EPO and/or Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 were overexpressed in rat hearts through intramyocardial administration of lentivirus expressing the EPO and TLR4 genes. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson's trichrome staining were performed on tissue sections from rat hearts for histopathological examination. ELISA was used to determine the levels of inflammatory mediators in serum. Gene expression levels were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and protein expression levels were determined by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. The results indicated that EPO overexpression improved MF in rat hearts, by inhibiting the release of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, IL-17A, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-2. Moreover, EPO overexpression suppressed the expression of TLR4, while promoting phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (Akt) expression levels. However, the beneficial effects of EPO were attenuated by overexpression of TLR4. In addition, inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling activity by treatment with LY294002 markedly reversed the protective effect of EPO on the AAC-induced MF. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that EPO may have a critical role against MF by activating PI3K/Akt signaling and by downregulating TLR4 expression, thereby inhibiting the release of TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-17A, MMP-9 and MMP-2. These findings suggest that the PI3K/Akt/TLR4 signaling pathway is associated with the anti-inflammatory effects of EPO and may play a role in attenuating AAC-induced MF.

30442153|t|Ca2+-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress correlation with astrogliosis involves upregulation of KCa3.1 and inhibition of AKT/mTOR signaling.
30442153|a|BACKGROUND: The intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3.1 was recently shown to control the phenotype switch of reactive astrogliosis (RA) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: KCa3.1 channels expression and cell localization in the brains of AD patients and APP/PS1 mice model were measured by immunoblotting and immunostaining. APP/PS1 mice and KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice were subjected to Morris water maze test to evaluate the spatial memory deficits. Glia activation and neuron loss was measured by immunostaining. Fluo-4AM was used to measure cytosolic Ca2+ level in beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced reactive astrocytes in vitro. RESULTS: KCa3.1 expression was markedly associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in both Abeta-stimulated primary astrocytes and brain lysates of AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mice. The KCa3.1 channel was shown to regulate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through an interaction with the Ca2+ channel Orai1 in primary astrocytes. Gene deletion or pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 protected against SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload and ER stress via the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in astrocytes. Importantly, gene deletion or blockade of KCa3.1 restored AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling both in vivo and in vitro. Consistent with these in vitro data, expression levels of the ER stress markers 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, as well as that of the RA marker glial fibrillary acidic protein were increased in APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Elimination of KCa3.1 in KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice corrected these abnormal responses. Moreover, glial activation and neuroinflammation were attenuated in the hippocampi of KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice, as compared with APP/PS1 mice. In addition, memory deficits and neuronal loss in APP/PS1 mice were reversed in KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that KCa3.1 is involved in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in astrocytes and attenuation of the UPR and ER stress, thus contributing to memory deficits and neuronal loss.

30562971|a|Galangin, a member of the flavonol compounds of the flavonoids, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in various cell types. It has been used for the treatment of arthritis, airway inflammation, stroke, and cognitive impairment. Thrombin, one of the regulators of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), has been known as a vital factor of physiological and pathological processes, including cell migration, the blood-brain barrier breakdown, brain edema formation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. MMP-9 especially may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effect of galangin in combating thrombin-induced MMP-9 expression is not well understood in neurons. Therefore, we attempted to explore the molecular mechanisms by which galangin inhibited MMP-9 expression and cell migration induced by thrombin in SK-N-SH cells (a human neuroblastoma cell line). Gelatin zymography, western blot, real-time PCR, and cell migration assay were used to elucidate the inhibitory effects of galangin on the thrmbin-mediated responses. The results showed that galangin markedly attenuated the thrombin-stimulated phosphorylation of proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (c-Src), proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), protein kinase C (PKC)alpha/beta/delta, protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK)1/2, p38 MAPK, forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), p65, and c-Jun and suppressed MMP-9 expression and cell migration in SK-N-SH cells. Our results concluded that galangin blocked the thrombin-induced MMP-9 expression in SK-N-SH cells via inhibiting c-Src, Pyk2, PKCalpha/betaII/delta, Akt, mTOR, p42/p44 MAPK, JNK1/2, p38 MAPK, FoxO1, c-Jun, and p65 phosphorylation and ultimately attenuated cell migration. Therefore, galangin may be a potential candidate for the management of brain inflammatory diseases.

30594253|t|Model based on GA and DNN for prediction of mRNA-Smad7 expression regulated by miRNAs in breast cancer.
30594253|a|BACKGROUND: The Smad7 protein is negative regulator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, which is upregulated in patients with breast cancer. miRNAs regulate proteins expressions by arresting or degrading the mRNAs. The purpose of this work is to identify a miRNAs profile that regulates the expression of the mRNA coding for Smad7 in breast cancer using the data from patients with breast cancer obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas Project. METHODS: We develop an automatic search method based on genetic algorithms to find a predictive model based on deep neural networks (DNN) which fit the set of biological data and apply the Olden algorithm to identify the relative importance of each miRNAs. RESULTS: A computational model of non-linear regression is shown, based on deep neural networks that predict the regulation given by the miRNA target transcripts mRNA coding for Smad7 protein in patients with breast cancer, with R2 of 0.99 is shown and MSE of 0.00001. In addition, the model is validated with the results in vivo and in vitro experiments reported in the literature. The set of miRNAs hsa-mir-146a, hsa-mir-93, hsa-mir-375, hsa-mir-205, hsa-mir-15a, hsa-mir-21, hsa-mir-20a, hsa-mir-503, hsa-mir-29c, hsa-mir-497, hsa-mir-107, hsa-mir-125a, hsa-mir-200c, hsa-mir-212, hsa-mir-429, hsa-mir-34a, hsa-let-7c, hsa-mir-92b, hsa-mir-33a, hsa-mir-15b, hsa-mir-224, hsa-mir-185 and hsa-mir-10b integrate a profile that critically regulates the expression of the mRNA coding for Smad7 in breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a genetic algorithm to select best features as DNN inputs (miRNAs). The genetic algorithm also builds the best DNN architecture by optimizing the parameters. Although the confirmation of the results by laboratory experiments has not occurred, the results allow suggesting that miRNAs profile could be used as biomarkers or targets in targeted therapies.

30730884|t|The Drosophila fussel gene is required for bitter gustatory neuron differentiation acting within an Rpd3 dependent chromatin modifying complex.
30730884|a|Members of the Ski/Sno protein family are classified as proto-oncogenes and act as negative regulators of the TGF-ss/BMP-pathways in vertebrates and invertebrates. A newly identified member of this protein family is fussel (fuss), the Drosophila homologue of the human functional Smad suppressing elements (fussel-15 and fussel-18). We and others have shown that Fuss interacts with SMAD4 and that overexpression leads to a strong inhibition of Dpp signaling. However, to be able to characterize the endogenous Fuss function in Drosophila melanogaster, we have generated a number of state of the art tools including anti-Fuss antibodies, specific fuss-Gal4 lines and fuss mutant fly lines via the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Fuss is a predominantly nuclear, postmitotic protein, mainly expressed in interneurons and fuss mutants are fully viable without any obvious developmental phenotype. To identify potential target genes or cells affected in fuss mutants, we conducted targeted DamID experiments in adult flies, which revealed the function of fuss in bitter gustatory neurons. We fully characterized fuss expression in the adult proboscis and by using food choice assays we were able to show that fuss mutants display defects in detecting bitter compounds. This correlated with a reduction of gustatory receptor gene expression (Gr33a, Gr66a, Gr93a) providing a molecular link to the behavioral phenotype. In addition, Fuss interacts with Rpd3, and downregulation of rpd3 in gustatory neurons phenocopies the loss of Fuss expression. Surprisingly, there is no colocalization of Fuss with phosphorylated Mad in the larval central nervous system, excluding a direct involvement of Fuss in Dpp/BMP signaling. Here we provide a first and exciting link of Fuss function in gustatory bitter neurons. Although gustatory receptors have been well characterized, little is known regarding the differentiation and maturation of gustatory neurons. This work therefore reveals Fuss as a pivotal element for the proper differentiation of bitter gustatory neurons acting within a chromatin modifying complex.
