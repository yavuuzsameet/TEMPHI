21062317|t|Dual Delta^1^3C/delta^1^8O response to water and nitrogen availability and its relationship with yield in field-grown durum wheat.
21062317|a|The combined use of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in plant matter is a tool of growing interest in cereal crop management and breeding, owing to its relevance for assessing the photosynthetic and transpirative performance under different growing conditions including water and N regimes. However, this method has not been applied to wheat grown under real field conditions. Here, plant growth, grain yield (GY) and the associated agronomic components, carbon isotope discrimination (Delta^1^3C) plus oxygen isotope composition (delta^1^8O) as well as leaf and canopy gas exchange were measured in field-grown wheat subjected to different water and N availabilities. Water limitation was the main factor affecting yield, leaf and canopy gas exchange and Delta^1^3C and delta^1^8O, whereas N had a smaller effect on such traits. The combination of Delta^1^3C and delta^1^8O gave a clear advantage compared with gas exchange measurements, as it provides information on the instantaneous and the long-term plant photosynthetic and transpirative performance and are less labour intensive than gas exchange measurements. In addition, the combination of plant Delta^1^3C and delta^1^8O predicted differences in GY and related agronomical parameters, providing agronomists and breeders with integrative traits for selecting crop management practices and/or genotypes with better performance under water-limiting and N-limiting conditions.

21131488|t|Bacillus anthracis sin locus and regulation of secreted proteases.
21131488|a|Bacillus anthracis shares many regulatory loci with the nonpathogenic Bacillus species Bacillus subtilis. One such locus is sinIR, which in B. subtilis controls sporulation, biofilm formation, motility, and competency. As B. anthracis is not known to be motile, to be naturally competent, or to readily form biofilms, we hypothesized that the B. anthracis sinIR regulon is distinct from that of B. subtilis. A genome-wide expression microarray analysis of B. anthracis parental and sinR mutant strains indicated limited convergence of the B. anthracis and B. subtilis SinR regulons. The B. anthracis regulon includes homologues of some B. subtilis SinR-regulated genes, including the signal peptidase gene sipW near the sinIR locus and the sporulation gene spoIIE. The B. anthracis SinR protein also negatively regulates transcription of genes adjacent to the sinIR locus that are unique to the Bacillus cereus group species. These include calY and inhA1, structural genes for the metalloproteases camelysin and immune inhibitor A1 (InhA1), which have been suggested to be associated with virulence in B. cereus and B. anthracis, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed direct binding of B. anthracis SinR to promoter DNA from strongly regulated genes, such as calY and sipW, but not to the weakly regulated inhA1 gene. Assessment of camelysin and InhA1 levels in culture supernates from sinR-, inhA1-, and calY-null mutants showed that the concentration of InhA1 in the culture supernatant is inversely proportional to the concentration of camelysin. Our data are consistent with a model in which InhA1 protease levels are controlled at the transcriptional level by SinR and at the posttranslational level by camelysin.

21074391|t|Diversity, distribution and biogeography of testate amoebae in China: implications for ecological studies in Asia.
21074391|a|Testate amoebae are a group of shelled protozoa that occur in high density populations in wet environments. More than 1900 testate amoebae species or subspecies have been reported in published literature over the last 200 years, from many regions of the world. Testate amoebae are classified as Lobosea or Filosea respectively, according to the presence of lobose or filiform pseudopodia. Testate amoebae have proved an interesting group of indicator organisms in palaeoenvironmental studies and have also been used as bioindicators of human impact on ecosystems. Until recently, the testate amoebae of China were unknown to most western scientists, but our knowledge has improved greatly over the past 20 years. This paper summarizes the testate amoebae research in China along with relevant data from other countries in Asia, and provides the necessary context for future research.

21349764|t|Interplay between the parasite Amoebophrya sp. (Alveolata) and the cyst formation of the red tide dinoflagellate Scrippsiella trochoidea.
21349764|a|Syndiniales (Alveolata) are marine parasites of a wide range of hosts, from unicellular organisms to Metazoa. Many Syndiniales obligatorily kill their hosts to accomplish their life cycle. This is the case for Amoebophrya spp. infecting dinoflagellates. However, several dinoflagellate species known to be infected by these parasites produce diploid resting cysts as part of their life history. These resting cysts may survive several seasons in the sediment before germinating. How these parasites survive during the dormancy of their host remained an open question. We successfully established infections by Amoebophrya sp. in the red tide dinoflagellate Scrippsiella trochoidea. This host strain was homothallic and able to continuously produce typical calcified cysts covered by calcareous spines. Presence of the parasite significantly speeded up the host cyst production, and cysts produced were the only cells to resist infections. However, some of them were clearly infected, probably earlier in their formation. After 10 months, cysts produced in presence of the parasite were able to germinate and new infective cycles of the parasite were rapidly observed. Thus, a very novel relationship for protists is demonstrated, one in which parasite and host simultaneously enter dormancy, emerging months later to propagate both species.

21109013|a|Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) are central components of the machinery mediating membrane fusion and key factors for vesicular trafficking in all eukaryotic cells. Taking advantage of the available whole genome sequence of the oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae, 35 genes encoding putative SNARE proteins were identified in the genome of this organism. PsYKT6, one of the most conserved SNARE proteins, was functionally characterized by homology-dependent gene silencing. The phenotype analysis showed that PsYKT6 is important for proper asexual development, sexual reproduction, and pathogenesis on host soybean cultivars.

21419234|t|Completing the purine utilisation pathway of Aspergillus nidulans.
21419234|a|We have previously identified by classical genetics and biochemistry, all the genes of Aspergillus nidulans predicted to be involved in purine utilisation, together with cognate regulatory genes and one gene encoding a novel xanthine hydroxylation activity. In this article we complete the description of the purine utilisation pathway with the identification of the two genes (uaX and uaW) encoding the enzymes catalysing the conversion of the product of urate oxidation by urate oxidase, 5-hydroxyisourate, to optically active allantoin. The identification of these additional genes confirms the complete absence of clustering of the genes involved in purine utilisation in A. nidulans.

20980510|t|Assembly and immunological properties of Newcastle disease virus-like particles containing the respiratory syncytial virus F and G proteins.
20980510|a|Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a serious respiratory pathogen in infants and young children as well as elderly and immunocompromised populations. However, no RSV vaccines are available. We have explored the potential of virus-like particles (VLPs) as an RSV vaccine candidate. VLPs composed entirely of RSV proteins were produced at levels inadequate for their preparation as immunogens. However, VLPs composed of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and chimera proteins containing the ectodomains of RSV F and G proteins fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of NDV F and HN proteins, respectively, were quantitatively prepared from avian cells. Immunization of mice with these VLPs, without adjuvant, stimulated robust, anti-RSV F and G protein antibody responses. IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were very high, suggesting predominantly T(H)1 responses. In contrast to infectious RSV immunization, neutralization antibody titers were robust and stable for 4 months. Immunization with a single dose of VLPs resulted in the complete protection of mice from RSV replication in lungs. Upon RSV intranasal challenge of VLP-immunized mice, no enhanced lung pathology was observed, in contrast to the pathology observed in mice immunized with formalin-inactivated RSV. These results suggest that these VLPs are effective RSV vaccines in mice, in contrast to other nonreplicating RSV vaccine candidates.

21401589|t|Comparing isotopic niche widths among and within communities: SIBER - Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R.
21401589|a|1. The use of stable isotope data to infer characteristics of community structure and niche width of community members has become increasingly common. Although these developments have provided ecologists with new perspectives, their full impact has been hampered by an inability to statistically compare individual communities using descriptive metrics. 2. We solve these issues by reformulating the metrics in a Bayesian framework. This reformulation takes account of uncertainty in the sampled data and naturally incorporates error arising from the sampling process, propagating it through to the derived metrics. 3. Furthermore, we develop novel multivariate ellipse-based metrics as an alternative to the currently employed Convex Hull methods when applied to single community members. We show that unlike Convex Hulls, the ellipses are unbiased with respect to sample size, and their estimation via Bayesian inference allows robust comparison to be made among data sets comprising different sample sizes. 4. These new metrics, which we call SIBER (Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R), open up more avenues for direct comparison of isotopic niches across communities. The computational code to calculate the new metrics is implemented in the free-to-download package Stable Isotope Analysis for the R statistical environment.

21073454|t|Ecological conditions in wintering and passage areas as determinants of timing of spring migration in trans-Saharan migratory birds.
21073454|a|1. Climate change has been associated with shifts in the timing of biological events, including the spring arrival of migratory birds. Early arrival at breeding sites is an important life-history trait, usually associated with higher breeding success and therefore, susceptible to selection and evolution in response to changing climatic conditions. 2. Here, we examine the effect of changes in the environmental conditions of wintering and passage areas on the mean passage time of 13 trans-Saharan passerines during their spring migration through the western Mediterranean over the 15 years from 1993 to 2007. 3. We found that most of the species studied have been advancing the timing of their passage in recent years. However, annual variation in the mean date of passage was positively correlated with vegetation growth (measured as the normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) both in the Sahel (the region of departure) and in northern Africa (the passage area). Thus, migration dates were delayed in years with high primary productivity in passage and wintering zones. All species seem to respond similarly to NDVI in the Sahel; however, late migrants were less affected by ecological conditions in northern Africa than those migrating earlier, suggesting differences based on species ecology. 4. Mean timing of passage was not related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), temperature or NDVI in the species-specific wintering areas (the overwintering region) when analysed in combination with the other covariates. 5. Our findings show that ecological conditions in the winter quarters (specifically the Sahel) and en route are relevant factors influencing trends in the passage dates of trans-Saharan migratory birds on the southern fringe of Europe. Possible long-term consequences for late arriving spring migrants are discussed.

22182619|t|Dispersion Models and Sampling of Cacao Mirid Bug Sahlbergella singularis (Hemiptera: Miridae) on Theobroma Cacao in Southern Cameroon.
22182619|a|The spatio-temporal distribution of Sahlbergella singularis Haglung, a major pest of cacao trees (Theobroma cacao) (Malvaceae), was studied for 2 yr in traditional cacao forest gardens in the humid forest area of southern Cameroon. The first objective was to analyze the dispersion of this insect on cacao trees. The second objective was to develop sampling plans based on fixed levels of precision for estimating S. singularis populations. The following models were used to analyze the data: Taylor's power law, Iwao's patchiness regression, the Nachman model, and the negative binomial distribution. Our results document that Taylor's power law was a better fit for the data than the Iwao and Nachman models. Taylor's b and Iwao's Beta were both significantly &gt;1, indicating that S. singularis aggregated on specific trees. This result was further supported by the calculated common k of 1.75444. Iwao's alpha was significantly &lt;0, indicating that the basic distribution component of S. singularis was the individual insect. Comparison of negative binomial (NBD) and Nachman models indicated that the NBD model was appropriate for studying S. singularis distribution. Optimal sample sizes for fixed precision levels of 0.10, 0.15, and 0.25 were estimated with Taylor's regression coefficients. Required sample sizes increased dramatically with increasing levels of precision. This is the first study on S. singularis dispersion in cacao plantations. Sampling plans, presented here, should be a tool for research on population dynamics and pest management decisions of mirid bugs on cacao.

21511198|t|The pharmacological treatment of epilepsy in adults.
21511198|a|Treatment decisions in epilepsy need to be individualised on the basis of careful analysis of the risk-benefit ratio of each available option. Key decision steps include the time at which antiepileptic drug treatment should be started, which drug should be chosen for first-line therapy, and which strategy is most appropriate for people who did not respond to the initially prescribed drug. With more than 20 antiepileptic drugs currently available to treat epilepsy in adults, opportunities to tailor drug therapy have never been greater, but optimum use of such a complex armamentarium is a challenge even for the epilepsy specialist. Antiepileptic drug choice is primarily based on evidence of efficacy and effectiveness for the individual's seizure type, but other patient-specific factors need to be considered, including age, sex, childbearing potential, comorbidities, and concomitant medications.

21062315|t|Cold stress contributes to aberrant cytokinesis during male meiosis I in a wheat thermosensitive genic male sterile line.
21062315|a|The male sterility of a wheat thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) line is strictly controlled by temperature. When the TGMS line BS366 was exposed to 10 ^0C from the pollen mother cell stage to the meiosis stage, a few pollen grains were formed and devoid of starch. We report here a large-scale transcriptomic study using the Affymetrix wheat GeneChip to follow gene expression in BS366 line anthers in response to cold stress. Notably, many cytoskeletal signaling components were gradually induced in response to cold stress in BS366 line anthers. However, the cytoskeleton-associated genes that play key roles in the dynamic organization of the cytoskeleton were dramatically repressed. Histological studies revealed that the separation of dyads occurred abnormally during male meiosis I, indicating defective male meiotic cytokinesis. Fluorescence labelling and subcellular histological observations revealed that the phragmoplast was defectively formed and the cell plate was abnormally assembled during meiosis I under cold stress. Based on the transcriptomic analysis and observations of characterized histological changes, our results suggest that cold stress repressed transcription of cytoskeleton dynamic factors and subsequently caused the defective cytokinesis during meiosis I. The results may explain the male sterility caused by low temperature in wheat TGMS lines.

21601645|t|Phr1p, a glycosylphosphatidylinsitol-anchored Beta(1,3)-glucanosyltransferase critical for hyphal wall formation, localizes to the apical growth sites and septa in Candida albicans.
21601645|a|Cell wall biogenesis is a dynamic process relying on the coordinated activity of several extracellular enzymes. PHR1 is a pH-regulated gene of Candida albicans encoding a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Beta(1,3)-glucanosyltransferase of family GH72 which acts as a cell wall remodelling enzyme and is crucial for morphogenesis and virulence. In order to explore the function of Phr1p, we obtained a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion to determine its localization. During induction of vegetative growth, Phr1p-GFP was concentrated in the plasma membrane of the growing bud, in the mother-bud neck, and in the septum. Phr1p-GFP was recovered in the detergent-resistant membranes indicating its association with the lipid rafts as the wild type Phr1p. Upon induction of hyphal growth, Phr1p-GFP highly concentrated at the apex of the germ tubes and progressively distributed along the lateral sides of the hyphae. Phr1p-GFP also labelled the hyphal septa, where it colocalized with chitin. Localization to the hyphal septa was perturbed in nocodazole-treated cells, whereas inhibition of actin polymerization hindered the apical localization. Electron Microscopy analysis of the hyphal wall ultrastructure of a PHR1 null mutant showed loss of compactness and irregular organization of the surface layer. These observations indicate that Phr1p plays a crucial role in hyphal wall formation, a highly regulated process on which morphogenesis and virulence rely.

20674491|t|Dependence between volumes of protoplast and lorica in lugol-fixed tintinnid ciliates.
20674491|a|The relationship between the volume of tintinnid loricae and protoplasts was studied on the basis of bulk data derived from samples collected in a range of temperate environments: riverine, lacustrine, estuarine, and marine. All organisms were fixed with acid Lugol solution (0.5-1.0%). The dependence was described with the allometric equation: VL=2.74xVP(1.03), where VL and VP are volumes [mum(3)] of loricae and protoplasts, respectively. The dependence was highly significant (p&lt;0.001, n=417, R(2)=0.85). On average, protoplasts occupied 31% of the lorica volume. One species, Helicostomella subulata,was omitted from the calculations and treated separately since this ciliate has a relatively large lorica. The relationship identified between lorica and protoplast volumes permits recalculating incomplete data if protoplasts are the only body part measured.

21029103|t|Phylloplane location of glucosinolates in Barbarea spp. (Brassicaceae) and misleading assessment of host suitability by a specialist herbivore.
21029103|a|Glucosinolates are plant secondary metabolites used in host plant recognition by insects specialized on Brassicaceae, such as the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella. Their perception as oviposition cues by females would seem to require their occurrence on the leaf surface, yet previous studies have reached opposite conclusions about whether glucosinolates are actually present on the surface of crucifer leaves. DBM oviposits extensively on Barbarea vulgaris, despite its larvae not being able to survive on this plant because of its content of feeding-deterrent saponins. Glucosinolates and saponins in plant tissue and mechanically removed surface waxes from leaves of Barbarea spp. were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Surface waxes from leaves of Barbarea spp. contained glucosinolates, but not feeding-deterrent saponins. Our research is the first to show that glucosinolates are present on the leaf surface of Barbarea spp., but not in other crucifers investigated, resolving some conflicting results from previous studies. Our research is also the first to quantify glucosinolates on the leaf surface of a crucifer, and to show that the concentrations of glucosinolates found on the leaf surface of Barbarea spp. are sufficient to be perceived by ovipositing DBM.

21115656|t|Novel members of the Cra regulon involved in carbon metabolism in Escherichia coli.
21115656|a|Cra (catabolite repressor activator) is a global regulator of the genes for carbon metabolism in Escherichia coli. To gain insights into the regulatory roles of Cra, attempts were made to identify the whole set of regulation targets using an improved genomic SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) system. Surprisingly, a total of 164 binding sites were identified for Cra, 144 (88%) of which were newly identified. The majority of known targets were included in the SELEX chip pattern. The promoters examined by the lacZ reporter assay in vivo were all regulated by Cra. These two lines of evidence indicate that a total of as many as 178 promoters are under the control of Cra. The majority of Cra targets are the genes coding for the enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism, covering all the genes for the enzymes involved in glycolysis and metabolism downstream of glycolysis, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and aerobic respiration. Taken together, we propose that Cra plays a key role in balancing the levels of the enzymes for carbon metabolism.

20955221|t|Comparison of seasonal variations in water-use efficiency calculated from the carbon isotope composition of tree rings and flux data in a temperate forest.
20955221|a|Tree-ring delta(13) C is often interpreted in terms of intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUE) using a carbon isotope discrimination model established at the leaf level. We examined whether intra-ring delta(13) C could be used to assess variations in intrinsic WUE (W(g), the ratio of carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance to water) and variations in ecosystem WUE (W(t) , the ratio of C assimilation and transpiration) at a seasonal scale. Intra-ring delta(13) C was measured in 30- to 60-mum-thick slices in eight oak trees (Quercus petraea). Canopy W(g) was simulated using a physiologically process-based model. High between-tree variability was observed in the seasonal variations of intra-ring delta(13) C. Six trees showed significant positive correlations between W(g) calculated from intra-ring delta(13) C and canopy W(g) averaged over several days during latewood formation. These results suggest that latewood is a seasonal recorder of W(g) trends, with a temporal lag corresponding to the mixing time of sugars in the phloem. These six trees also showed significant negative correlations between photosynthetic discrimination Delta calculated from intra-ring delta(13) C, and ecosystem W(t), during latewood formation. Despite the observed between-tree variability, these results indicate that intra-ring delta(13) C can be used to access seasonal variations in past W(t).

20980512|t|Serine-threonine ubiquitination mediates downregulation of BST-2/tetherin and relief of restricted virion release by HIV-1 Vpu.
20980512|a|The HIV-1 protein Vpu counteracts the antiviral activity of the innate restriction factor BST-2/tetherin by a mechanism that partly depends on its interaction with Beta-TrCP, a substrate adaptor for an SCF (Skp-Cullin 1-F box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This suggests that Vpu stimulates the ubiquitination of BST-2 and that this underlies the relief of restriction. Here, we show that Vpu stimulates ubiquitination of BST-2. Mutation of all potential ubiquitination sites in the cytoplasmic domain of BST-2, including lysines, cysteines, serines, and threonines, abrogates Vpu-mediated ubiquitination. However, a serine-threonine-serine sequence specifically mediates the downregulation of BST-2 from the cell surface and the optimal relief of restricted virion release.

20840611|t|Do quantitative vessel and pit characters account for ion-mediated changes in the hydraulic conductance of angiosperm xylem?
20840611|a|* The hydraulic conductance of angiosperm xylem has been suggested to vary with changes in sap solute concentrations because of intervessel pit properties. * The magnitude of the 'ionic effect' was linked with vessel and pit dimensions in 20 angiosperm species covering 13 families including six Lauraceae species. * A positive correlation was found between ionic effect and vessel grouping parameters, especially the portion of vessel walls in contact with neighbouring vessels. Species with intervessel contact fraction (F(C)) values &lt; 0.1 showed an ionic effect between 2% and 17%, while species with F(C) values > 0.1 exhibited a response between 10% and 32%. The ionic effect increased linearly with the mean fraction of the total vessel wall area occupied by intervessel pits as well as with the intervessel contact length. However, no significant correlation occurred between the ionic effect and total intervessel pit membrane area per vessel, vessel diameter, vessel length, vessel wall area, and intervessel pit membrane thickness. * Quantitative vessel and pit characters are suggested to contribute to interspecific variation of the ionic effect, whereas chemical properties of intervessel pit membranes are likely to play an additional role.

20980526|t|An in-depth analysis of original antigenic sin in dengue virus infection.
20980526|a|The evolution of dengue viruses has resulted in four antigenically similar yet distinct serotypes. Infection with one serotype likely elicits lifelong immunity to that serotype, but generally not against the other three. Secondary or sequential infections are common, as multiple viral serotypes frequently cocirculate. Dengue infection, although frequently mild, can lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) which can be life threatening. DHF is more common in secondary dengue infections, implying a role for the adaptive immune response in the disease. There is currently much effort toward the design and implementation of a dengue vaccine but these efforts are made more difficult by the challenge of inducing durable neutralizing immunity to all four viruses. Domain 3 of the dengue virus envelope protein (ED3) has been suggested as one such candidate because it contains neutralizing epitopes and it was originally thought that relatively few cross-reactive antibodies are directed to this domain. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of the anti-ED3 response in a cohort of patients suffering either primary or secondary dengue infections. The results show dramatic evidence of original antigenic sin in secondary infections both in terms of binding and enhancement activity. This has important implications for dengue vaccine design because heterologous boosting is likely to maintain the immunological footprint of the first vaccination. On the basis of these findings, we propose a simple in vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to diagnose the original dengue infection in secondary dengue cases.

21497073|t|Dynamic behaviour of stationary pronuclei during their positioning in Paramecium caudatum.
21497073|a|During conjugation of Paramecium caudatum, there are two well-known stages when nuclear migration occurs. What happens to the nuclei is closely related to their localisations in cells. The first of these stages is the entrance of one meiotic product into the paroral region. This nucleus survives, while the remaining three outside this area degenerate. The second stage is the antero-posterior localisation of eight synkaryon division products. Four posterior nuclei are differentiated into macronuclear anlagen, whereas four anterior nuclei remain as the presumptive micronuclei. In this experiment, the process of the third prezygotic division of P. caudatum was studied with the help of protargol staining. Here, a third nuclear migration was discovered. By two spindle turnings and two spindle elongations, stationary pronuclei were positioned near migratory pronuclei. This positioning of stationary pronuclei could shorten the distance for transferred migratory pronuclei to recognise and reach the stationary pronuclei. This fosters the synkaryon formation of P. caudatum.

21453780|t|Structure and evolution of the Fusarium mating type locus: new insights from the Gibberellafujikuroi complex.
21453780|a|Mating type genes are central to sexual reproduction and compatibility in Ascomycete fungi. However the &quot;MAT&quot; loci experience unique evolutionary pressures that can result in rapid divergence and enhanced inter-specific gene-flow (lateral gene transfer). In this study, molecular evolution of MAT loci was considered using the genus Fusarium (Teleomorph: Gibberella) as a model. Both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 &quot;idiomorphs&quot; from eleven species of the Gibberellafujikuroi species complex were sequenced. Molecular evolution of the MAT loci from these heterothallic (self-sterile) species was compared with that of the MAT loci from nine homothallic (self-fertile) species in the Fusariumgraminearum species complex. Although Fusarium has previously been thought to have the same complement of four MAT genes that are found in Neurospora, we found evidence of a novel gene, MAT1-2-3, that may be specific to the Hypocreales. All MAT genes share a similar set of cis-regulatory motifs, although homothallic species might have recruited novel regulatory elements, which could potentially facilitate alternate expression of MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1. FusariumMAT loci displayed evidence consistent with historical lateral gene-flow. Most notably, the MAT1-1 idiomorph of Fusariumsacchari appears to be unrelated to those of other species in the G.fujikuroi complex. In general, FusariumMAT genes are highly divergent. Both positive selection and relaxed selective constraint could account for this phenomenon. However, the extent of both recombination and inter-specific gene-flow in the MAT locus also appears to affect the rate of divergence.

21349119|t|Differentially expressed genes in silkworm cell cultures in response to infection by Wolbachia and Cardinium endosymbionts.
21349119|a|Wolbachia and Cardinium are bacterial endosymbionts that are widely distributed amongst arthropods. Both cause reproductive alterations, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis and feminization. Here we studied differentially expressed genes in Wolbachia- and Cardinium-infected Bm-aff3 silkworm cells using a silkworm microarray. Wolbachia infection did not alter gene expression or induce or suppress immune responses. In contrast, Cardinium infection induced many immune-related genes, including antimicrobial peptides, pattern recognition receptors and a serine protease. Host immune responses differed, possibly because of the different cell wall structures of Wolbachia and Cardinium because the former lacks genes encoding lipopolysaccharide components and two racemases for peptidoglycan formation. A few possibly non-immune-related genes were differentially expressed, but their involvement in host reproductive alteration was unclear.

21388371|t|Predation and patchiness in the tropical litter: do swarm-raiding army ants skim the cream or drain the bottle?
21388371|a|1. Swarm-raiding army ants have long been considered as episodic, catastrophic agents of disturbance in the tropical litter, but few quantitative data exist on their diets, preferences, and, critically, their ability to deplete prey. 2. Here, we provide such data for two common species of swarm raiders broadly sympatric throughout the Neotropics: the iconic Eciton burchellii and the more secretive, less studied Labidus praedator. In Ecuador, Costa Rica, Venezuela and Panama, patches of forest floor were sampled for litter invertebrates immediately before and after army ant raids. These invertebrates have been shown to regulate decomposition and vary 100-fold in local densities across the forest floor. 3. Contrary to Eciton's popular image, only Labidus consistently reduced the biomass of litter invertebrates and only then by an average of 25%. Eciton's impacts were concentrated on rich patches of invertebrates, while Labidus prey depletion showed no such density dependence. Labidus reduced the biomass of some invertebrates-isopods, larviforms and coleoptera-by up to 75%; Eciton showed no such prey preferences. 4. Our results suggest that Eciton specializes on high biomass patches, while Labidus feeds profitably from any litter patch. Combined, these swarm raiders sum to be chronic, but not catastrophic, predators of common litter invertebrates of the brown food web.

20854480|t|Expression of diverse midgut serine proteinases in the sericigenous Lepidoptera Antheraea assamensis (Helfer) is influenced by choice of host plant species.
20854480|a|Antheraea assamensis is reared on various species of the Lauraceae family from north-east India for its distinctive cocoon silk. We demonstrate differential expression of digestive trypsin and chymotrypsins in larvae feeding on a primary host, Persea bombycina Kosterm., in comparison to larvae feeding on Litsea monopetala Roxb. using in vitro proteolytic assays, zymogram analyses with proteinase inhibitors, restriction digestion of RNA-PCR amplicons and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Eight novel members of the serine proteinase gene family were identified, including an intron-spliced trypsin (AaPb4) and seven putative chymotrypsins (AaPb2, AaPb4, AaPb12, AaLm4, AaLm6, AaLm19 and AaLm29). Midgut transcript levels of the putative trypsin were higher in larvae fed P. bombycina whereas levels of transcripts encoding putative chymotrypsins were higher in larvae reared on L. monopetala. Complex, differential expression of sequence divergent midgut serine proteinases may reflect the ability of lepidopteran larvae to feed on different species of host plants. Possible implications of host plant choice on the digestive physiology of A. assamensis are discussed.

20955223|t|A new filter that accurately mimics the solar UV-B spectrum using standard UV lamps: the photochemical properties, stabilization and use of the urate anion liquid filter.
20955223|a|The physiological effects unique to solar ultraviolet (UV)-B exposure (280-315 nm) are difficult to accurately replicate in the laboratory. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the sodium urate anion in a liquid filter that yields a spectrum nearly indistinguishable from the solar UV-B spectrum while filtering the emissions of widely used UV-B lamps. The photochemical properties and stability of this filter are examined and weighed against a typical spectrum of ground-level solar UV-B radiation. To test the effectiveness of this filter, light-saturated photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates were measured following exposure to UV-B filtered either by this urate filter or the widely used cellulose acetate (CA) filter. The ubiquitous marine Chlorophyte alga Dunaliella tertiolecta was tested under identical UV-B flux densities coupled with ecologically realistic fluxes of UV-A and visible radiation for 6 and 12 h exposures. These results indicate that the urate-filtered UV-B radiation yields minor photosynthetic inhibition when compared with exposures lacking in UV-B. This is in agreement with published experiments using solar radiation. In sharp contrast, radiation filtered by CA filters produced large inhibition of photosynthesis.

21097616|t|A LytM domain dictates the localization of proteins to the mother cell-forespore interface during bacterial endospore formation.
21097616|a|A large number of proteins are known to reside at specific subcellular locations in bacterial cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which many of these proteins are anchored at these locations remains unclear. During endospore formation in Bacillus subtilis, several integral membrane proteins are located specifically at the interface of the two adjacent cells of the developing sporangium, the mother cell and forespore. The mother cell membrane protein SpoIIIAH recognizes the cell-cell interface through an interaction with the forespore membrane protein SpoIIQ, and then the other proteins are positioned there by the SpoIIIAH-SpoIIQ complex. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the SpoIIIAH-SpoIIQ complex. Using gel filtration chromatography and isothermal titration calorimetry, we measured the binding parameters that characterize the SpoIIIAH-SpoIIQ interaction in vitro. We also demonstrated that the interaction of SpoIIIAH and SpoIIQ is governed by their YscJ and degenerate LytM domains, respectively. Therefore, the LytM domain of SpoIIQ provides the positional cue that dictates the localization of mother cell membrane proteins to the mother cell-forespore interface.

21349120|t|Neuropeptide Y-like signalling and nutritionally mediated gene expression and behaviour in the honey bee.
21349120|a|Previous research has led to the idea that derived traits can arise through the evolution of novel roles for conserved genes. We explored whether neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like signalling, a conserved pathway that regulates food-related behaviour, is involved in a derived, nutritionally-related trait, the division of labour in worker honey bees. Transcripts encoding two NPY-like peptides were expressed in separate populations of brain neurosecretory cells, consistent with endocrine functions. NPY-related genes were upregulated in the brains of older foragers compared with younger bees performing brood care ('nurses'). A subset of these changes can be attributed to nutrition, but neuropeptide F peptide treatments did not influence sugar intake. These results contrast with recent reports of more robust associations between division of labour and the related insulin-signalling pathway and suggest that some elements of molecular pathways associated with feeding behaviour may be more evolutionarily labile than others.

21401592|t|Negotiating a noisy, information-rich environment in search of cryptic prey: olfactory predators need patchiness in prey cues.
21401592|a|1. Olfactory predator search processes differ fundamentally to those based on vision, particularly when odour cues are deposited rather than airborne or emanating from a point source. When searching for visually cryptic prey that may have moved some distance from a deposited odour cue, cue context and spatial variability are the most likely sources of information about prey location available to an olfactory predator. 2. We tested whether the house mouse (Mus domesticus), a model olfactory predator, would use cue context and spatial variability when searching for buried food items; specifically, we tested the effect of varying cue patchiness, odour strength, and cue-prey association on mouse foraging success. 3. Within mouse- and predator-proof enclosures, we created grids of 100 sand-filled Petri dishes and buried peanut pieces in a set number of these patches to represent visually cryptic 'prey'. By adding peanut oil to selected dishes, we varied the spatial distribution of prey odour relative to the distribution of prey patches in each grid, to reflect different levels of cue patchiness (Experiment 1), odour strength (Experiment 2) and cue-prey association (Experiment 3). We measured the overnight foraging success of individual mice (percentage of searched patches containing prey), as well as their foraging activity (percentage of patches searched), and prey survival (percentage of unsearched prey patches). 4. Mouse foraging success was highest where odour cues were patchy rather than uniform (Experiment 1), and where cues were tightly associated with prey location, rather than randomly or uniformly distributed (Experiment 3). However, when cues at prey patches were ten times stronger than a uniformly distributed weak background odour, mice did not improve their foraging success over that experienced when cues were of uniform strength and distribution (Experiment 2). 5. These results suggest that spatial variability and cue context are important means by which olfactory predators can use deposited odour cues to locate visually cryptic prey. They also indicate that chemical crypsis can disrupt these search processes as effectively as background matching in visually based predator-prey systems.

21272794|t|Emerging opportunistic yeast infections.
21272794|a|A growing population of immunosuppressed patients has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive fungal infections, including those caused by unusual yeasts. The incidence of non-albicans species of Candida is increasing compared with that of Candida albicans, and several species, such as Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, may be resistant to azole antifungal therapy. Trichosporon species are the second most common cause of fungaemia in patients with haematological malignant disease and are characterised by resistance to amphotericin and echinocandins and poor prognosis. Rhodotorula species belong to the family Cryptococcaceae, and are a cause of catheter-related fungaemia, sepsis, and invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients. An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive fungal infections by non-neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, especially for patients with advanced HIV infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant. Other uncommon yeasts that can cause invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients include Geotrichum, Hansenula, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive fungal infection a patient is at risk for. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies heavily on traditional cultures of blood and other sterile sites, although serum (1,3)-Beta-D-glucan testing might have an adjunctive role. Although rare yeasts are emerging as opportunistic human pathogens, diagnosis remains challenging and treatment suboptimal.

21295519|t|Novel cultured protists identify deep-branching environmental DNA clades of cercozoa: New Genera Tremula, Micrometopion, Minimassisteria, Nudifila, Peregrinia.
21295519|a|We describe three new orders of filosan Cercozoa, five new deep-branching genera, eight new species of Thaumatomonas, Reckertia, Spongomonas, Rhogostoma, Agitata, Neoheteromita and Paracercomonas, sequence their 18S rDNA, and construct 18S rDNA trees for 148 Cercozoa. Our phylogeny indicates that Filosa were ancestrally gliding flagellates; non-flagellate filose amoebae evolved from them five times independently. The new genera are more closely related to environmental DNA sequences than cultured organisms. Tremula longifila, a zooflagellate glider on both flagella (unlike other Cercozoa), is the most divergent filosan (Tremulida ord. n.). Micrometopion nutans is a eukaryote-eating gliding zooflagellate like Metopion and Metromonas. Minimassisteria diva is a widespread trimorphic marine amoeboflagellate granofilosan. Peregrinia clavideferens, a non-testate, scale-bearing, filose amoeba, branches deeply in Thaumatomonadida, which are probably sisters to Spongomonadida. Nudifila producta is a filose amoeboflagellate related to Clautriavia and Marimonadida (ord. n., e.g. Pseudopirsonia, Auranticordis). We substantially revise Imbricatea, now including Spongomonadida, and Thecofilosea to include Phaeodaria. Thecofilosea and Imbricatea and Thecofilosea are sisters, both arguably ancestrally rigid gliding flagellates with ventral pseudopod-emitting grooves. Scale-free Ovulinata parva is sister to Paulinella, so imbricate silica scales can be lost. Internal hollow silica skeletons evolved twice in Thecofilosea (Ebriida, Phaeodaria) or were multiply lost. Protaspa replaces preoccupied 'Protaspis'.

20933015|a|This study investigated the suitability of a two step real-time RT-PCR melting curve analysis as a tool for the detection and discrimination of nine species in the plant virus family Luteoviridae, being Soybean dwarf virus [SbDV], Bean leafroll virus [BLRV], Beet chlorosis virus [BChV], Beet mild yellowing virus [BMYV], Beet western yellows virus [BWYV], Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV [CYDV-RPV], Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus [CABYV], Potato leafroll virus [PLRV] and Turnip yellows virus [TuYV]. Melting temperature and shape of the melting peak were analysed for 68 bp and 148 bp coat protein gene amplicons using SYBR(R) GreenER(TM) fluorescent dye. Specific melting peaks with unique melting temperature were observed for the various species of the family Luteoviridae using the 68 bp amplicon, but not with the 148 bp amplicon. Due to the high variability of sequences for some members of this family, different melting temperatures were also observed between different isolates of the species CYDV-RPV and TuYV. Nevertheless, discrimination between species was achieved for SbDV, BLRV, BChV, BMYV, CABYV and either PLRV or BWYV. Melting curve analysis, in this study, is a faster and more discriminatory alternative to gel electrophoresis of end-point PCR products for the detection of Luteoviridae infection.

20884291|t|Symbiotic Chlorella vulgaris of the ciliate Paramecium bursaria plays an important role in maintaining perialgal vacuole membrane functions.
20884291|a|Treatment of symbiotic alga-bearing Paramecium bursaria cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, induces synchronous swelling of all perialgal vacuoles at about 24h after treatment under a constant light condition. Subsequently, the vacuoles detach from the host cell cortex. The algae in the vacuoles are digested by the host's lysosomal fusion to the vacuoles. To elucidate the timing of algal degeneration, P. bursaria cells were treated with cycloheximide under a constant light condition. Then the cells were observed using transmission electron microscopy. Results show that algal chloroplasts and nuclei degenerated within 9h after treatment, but before the synchronous swelling of the perialgal vacuole and appearance of acid phosphatase activity in the perialgal vacuole by lysosomal fusion. Treatment with cycloheximide under a constant dark condition and treatment with chloramphenicol under a constant light condition induced neither synchronous swelling of the vacuoles nor digestion of the algae inside the vacuoles. These results demonstrate that algal proteins synthesized during photosynthesis are necessary to maintain chloroplastic and nuclear structures, and that inhibition of protein synthesis induces rapid lysis of these organelles, after which synchronous swelling of the perialgal vacuole and fusion occur with the host lysosomes.

21570267|a|Three marine scuticociliates, Falcicyclidium fangi nov. gen., nov. spec., Falcicyclidium atractodes nov. spec., and Cristigera media Kahl, 1928 were investigated using live observation and silver impregnation methods. The genus Falcicyclidium is distinguished by the combination of: (i) dorsoventrally flattened body, (ii) hook-like (falciform) paroral membrane, (iii) anterior end of paroral membrane posterior to anterior end of membranelle 1, and (iv) multiple caudal cilia. Falcicyclidium fangi nov. spec., the type of the new genus, can be recognized by the combination of its large size, extremely dorsoventrally flattened (3:1) body, consistently 10 somatic kineties, and the broad, elongate buccal area occupying 60% of the body length. Falcicyclidium atractodes nov. spec. is mainly characterized by a unique spine projecting from both the anterior and posterior end.

21226710|t|Alternative community compositional and dynamical states: the dual consequences of assembly history.
21226710|a|1. Much work on ecological consequences of community assembly history has focused on the formation of history-induced alternative stable equilibria. We hypothesize that assembly history may affect not only community composition but also population dynamics, with assembled communities differing in species composition potentially residing in different dynamical states. 2. We provided an empirical test of the aforementioned hypothesis using a laboratory microcosm experiment that manipulated both the colonization order of three bacterivorous protist species in the presence of a protist predator and environmental productivity. 3. Both priority effects and random divergence emerged, resulting in two different community compositional states: one characterized by the dominance of one prey species and the other by the extinction of the same prey. While communities in the former state exhibited noncyclic dynamics, the majority of communities in the latter state exhibited cyclic dynamics driven by the interaction between another prey and the predator. 4. Temporal variability of total prey community biovolume consequently differed among communities with different histories. 5. Changing productivity altered priority effects on the structure and dynamics of communities experiencing only certain histories. 6. Our results support the dual (compositional and dynamical) consequences of assembly history and emphasize the importance of incorporating the dynamical view into the field of community assembly.

21429803|t|European guidelines on the clinical management of HIV-1 tropism testing.
21429803|a|Viral tropism is the ability of viruses to enter and infect specific host cells and is based on the ability of viruses to bind to receptors on those cells. Testing for HIV tropism is recommended before prescribing a chemokine receptor blocker. In most European countries, HIV tropism is identified with tropism phenotype testing. New data support genotype analysis of the HIV third hypervariable loop (V3) for the identification of tropism. The European Consensus Group on clinical management of tropism testing was established to make recommendations to clinicians and clinical virologists. The panel recommends HIV-tropism testing for the following groups: drug-naive patients in whom toxic effects are anticipated or for whom few treatment options are available; patients who have poor tolerability to or toxic effects from current treatment or who have CNS pathology; and patients for whom therapy has failed and a change in treatment is considered. In general, an enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay and V3 population genotyping are the recommended methods. Genotypic methods are anticipated to be used more frequently in the clinical setting because of their greater accessibility, lower cost, and faster turnaround time than other methods. For the interpretation of V3 loop genotyping, clinically validated systems should be used when possible. Laboratories doing HIV tropism tests should have adequate quality assurance measures. Similarly, close collaboration between HIV clinicians and virologists is needed to ensure adequate diagnostic and treatment decisions.

20601041|t|Surveys of non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide assembly lines in fungi and prospects for their analysis in vitro and in vivo.
20601041|a|With many bioactive non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides produced in fungi, studies of their biosyntheses are an active area of research. Practical limitations of working with mega-dalton synthetases including cell lysis and protein extraction to recombinant gene and pathway expression has slowed understanding of many secondary metabolic processes relative to bacterial counterparts. Recent advances in accessing fungal biosynthetic machinery are beginning to change this. Here we describe the successes of some studies of thiotemplate biosynthesis in fungal systems, along with very recent advances in chemical tagging and mass spectrometric strategies to selectively study biosynthetic conveyer belts in isolation, and within a few years, in endogenous fungal proteomes.

21376292|t|Breast-cancer early detection in low-income and middle-income countries: do what you can versus one size fits all.
21376292|a|In general, rates of breast cancer are lower in low-income and middle-income countries (LMCs) than they are in more industrialised countries of North America and Europe. This lower incidence means that screening programmes aimed at early detection in asymptomatic women would have a lower yield--ie, substantially more women would need to be examined to find a true case of breast cancer. Because the average age of breast cancer is generally younger in LMCs, it has been suggested that breast-cancer screening programmes begin at an earlier age in these settings. However, the younger average age of breast cancer is mainly driven by the age distribution of the population, and fewer older women with breast cancer, rather than by higher age-specific incidence rates in younger women. Resources in LMCs might be better used to raise awareness and encourage more women with palpable breast lumps to seek and receive treatment in a timely manner.

20962100|t|Dynamics of two separate but linked HIV-1 CRF01_AE outbreaks among injection drug users in Stockholm, Sweden, and Helsinki, Finland.
20962100|a|Detailed phylogenetic analyses were performed to characterize an HIV-1 outbreak among injection drug users (IDUs) in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2006. This study investigated the source and dynamics of HIV-1 spread during the outbreak as well as associated demographic and clinical factors. Seventy Swedish IDUs diagnosed during 2004 to 2007 were studied. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, and the V3 region of the HIV-1 envelope gene was sequenced to allow detailed phylogenetic analyses. The results showed that the Stockholm outbreak was caused by a CRF01_AE variant imported from Helsinki, Finland, around 2003, which was quiescent until the outbreak started in 2006. Local Swedish subtype B variants continued to spread at a lower rate. The number of new CRF01_AE cases over a rooted phylogenetic tree accurately reflected the transmission dynamics and showed a temporary increase, by a factor of 12, in HIV incidence during the outbreak. Virus levels were similar in CRF01_AE and subtype B infections, arguing against differences in contagiousness. Similarly, there were no major differences in other baseline characteristics. Instead, the outbreak in Stockholm (and Helsinki) was best explained by an introduction of HIV into a standing network of previously uninfected IDUs. The combination of phylogenetics and epidemiological data creates a powerful tool for investigating outbreaks of HIV and other infectious diseases that could improve surveillance and prevention.

21097633|t|Genome annotation and intraviral interactome for the Streptococcus pneumoniae virulent phage Dp-1.
21097633|a|Streptococcus pneumoniae causes several diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis. Phage Dp-1 is one of the very few isolated virulent S. pneumoniae bacteriophages, but only a partial characterization is currently available. Here, we confirmed that Dp-1 belongs to the family Siphoviridae. Then, we determined its complete genomic sequence of 56,506 bp. It encodes 72 open reading frames, of which 44 have been assigned a function. We have identified putative promoters, Rho-independent terminators, and several genomic clusters. We provide evidence that Dp-1 may be using a novel DNA replication system as well as redirecting host protein synthesis through queuosine-containing tRNAs. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of purified phage Dp-1 particles identified at least eight structural proteins. Finally, using comprehensive yeast two-hybrid screens, we identified 156 phage protein interactions, and this intraviral interactome was used to propose a structural model of Dp-1.

21323920|t|Patchy bed disturbance and fish predation independently influence the distribution of stream invertebrates and algae.
21323920|a|1. The identification of factors determining the patchy distribution of organisms in space and time is a central concern of ecology. Predation and abiotic disturbance are both well-known drivers of this patchiness, but their interplay is still poorly understood, especially for communities dominated by mobile organisms in frequently disturbed ecosystems. 2. We investigated the separate and interactive influences of bed disturbance by floods and predation by fish on the benthic community in a flood-prone stream. Electric fields excluded fish predators from half of 48 stream bed patches (area 0*49 m(2) ) with contrasting disturbance treatments. Three types of bed disturbance were created by either scouring or filling patches to a depth of 15-20 cm or by leaving the patches undisturbed, thus mimicking the mosaic of scour and fill caused by a moderate flood. Benthic invertebrates and algae were sampled repeatedly until 57 days after the disturbance. 3. Disturbance influenced all ten investigated biological response variables, whereas predation affected four variables. Averaged across time, invertebrate taxon richness and total abundance were highest in stable patches. Algal biomass and densities of five of the seven most common invertebrate taxa (most of which were highly mobile) were higher in fill than in scour patches, whereas two taxa were more abundant in scour and stable than in fill patches. Furthermore, two common invertebrate grazers were more abundant and algal biomass tended to be reduced in fish exclusion patches, suggesting a patch-scale trophic cascade from fish to algae. 4. Our results highlight the importance of patchy physical disturbance for the microdistribution of mobile stream organisms and indicate a notable, but less prevalent, influence of fish predation at the patch scale in this frequently disturbed environment. Disturbance and predation treatments interacted only once, suggesting that the observed predation effects were largely independent of local bed disturbance patterns.

21029749|t|Double-antigen sandwich ELISA for the detection of anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies.
21029749|a|A double-antigen sandwich ELISA was developed a detection of HCV antibodies by a recombinant multi-epitope HCV antigen and a biotin-streptavidin amplification system. Three plasma specimens from 1708 individuals who were suspected previously to be HCV-positive using an HCV antibody diagnostic kit (Chuangxin, Xiamen, China) displayed negative results when using the ELISA. These results were validated by a recombinant immunoblotting assay (two were negative, and one was indeterminate). Among 889 blood specimens donated for clinical evaluation, 246 were positive and 630 were negative using the ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 98.7% and 100%, respectively. In 43 donors and 14 patients with chronic hepatitis C, the detectable rates for HCV IgM by both ELISA and the HCV anti-IgM detection reagents (Huimin, Shenyang, China) were 100%, and the detectable rate for HCV IgG using an indirect HCV-antibody detection kit (GWK, Beijing, China) was 98.3%. Thus, the double-antigen sandwich ELISA exhibits strong specificity and sensitivity and has been approved by the China State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). The performance of the double-antigen sandwich ELISA was similar to the Ortho ELISA 3.0. It did not give false-negative results otherwise IgM was undetectable using an indirect HCV-antibody detection kit. This ELISA provides another method for the detection of HCV antibodies.

21521140|t|Characterization of nonjunctional hemichannels in caterpillar cells.
21521140|a|Recent studies have demonstrated that hemichannels, which form gap junctions when paired from apposing cells, may serve additional roles when unpaired including cell adhesion and paracrine communication. Hemichannels in mammals are formed by connexins or pannexins, while in insects they are formed by pannexin homologues termed innexins. The formation of functional gap junctions by insect innexins has been established, although their ability to form functional nonjunctional hemichannels has not been reported. Here the characteristics of nonjunctional hemichannels were examined in three lepidopteran cell types, two cell lines (High Five and Sf9) and explanted hemocytes from Heliothis virescens (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Selective fluorescent dye uptake by hemichannels was observed in a significant minority of cells, using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Carbenoxelone, an inhibitor of mammalian junctions, disrupted dye uptake, while flufenamic acid and mefloquine did not. The presence of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) in the media increased hemichannel activity. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide, a stimulator of immune activity in lepidopterans, decreased dye uptake. These results demonstrate for the first time the activity of nonjunctional hemichannels in insect cells, as well as pharmacological tools to manipulate them. These results will facilitate the further examination of the role of innexins and nonjunctional hemichannels in insect cell biology, including paracrine signaling, and comparative studies of mammalian pannexins and insect innexins.

20923689|t|Simultaneous virus-specific detection of the two cassava brown streak-associated viruses by RT-PCR reveals wide distribution in East Africa, mixed infections, and infections in Manihot glaziovii.
20923689|a|The expanding cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) epidemic in East Africa is caused by two ipomoviruses (genus Ipomovirus; Potyviridae), namely, Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV), and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV) that was described recently. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based diagnostic method was developed in this study for simultaneous virus-specific detection of the two viruses. Results showed that CBSV and UCBSV are distributed widely in the highlands (> 1000 m above the sea level) of the Lake Victoria zone in Uganda and Tanzania and also in the Indian Ocean costal lowlands of Tanzania. Isolates of UCBSV from the Lake Victoria zone were placed to two phylogenetic clusters in accordance with their origin in Uganda or Tanzania, respectively. Mixed infections with CBSV and UCBSV were detected in many cassava plants in the areas surveyed. CBSV was also detected in the perennial species Manihot glaziovii (DNA-barcoded in this study) in Tanzania, which revealed the first virus reservoir other than cassava. The method for detection of CBSV and UCBSV described in this study has important applications for plant quarantine, resistance breeding of cassava, and studies on epidemiology and control of CBSD in East Africa.

21114562|t|Improved accuracy of the transcriptional profiling method of age grading in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes under laboratory and semi-field cage conditions and in the presence of Wolbachia infection.
21114562|a|Transcriptional profiling is an effective method of predicting age in the mosquito Aedes aegypti in the laboratory, however, its effectiveness is limited to younger mosquitoes. To address this we used a microarray to identify new gene candidates that show significant expression changes in older mosquitoes. These genes were then used to create a revised model, which upon evaluation in both laboratory and semi-field conditions, proved to have improved accuracy overall and for older mosquitoes. In association with the development of symbiont-based control strategies for Ae. aegypti, we also tested the model's accuracy for Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and found no decline in performance. Our findings suggest that the new model is a robust and powerful tool for age determination in Australian Ae. aegypti populations.

20825576|t|Drought limitation of photosynthesis differs between C3and C4grass species in a comparative experiment.
20825576|a|Phylogenetic analyses show that C4 grasses typically occupy drier habitats than their C3 relatives, but recent experiments comparing the physiology of closely related C3 and C4 species have shown that advantages of C4 photosynthesis can be lost under drought. We tested the generality of these paradoxical findings in grass species representing the known evolutionary diversity of C4 NADP-me and C3 photosynthetic types. Our experiment investigated the effects of drought on leaf photosynthesis, water potential, nitrogen, chlorophyll content and mortality. C4 grasses in control treatments were characterized by higher CO2 assimilation rates and water potential, but lower stomatal conductance and nitrogen content. Under drought, stomatal conductance declined more dramatically in C3 than C4 species, and photosynthetic water-use and nitrogen-use efficiency advantages held by C4 species under control conditions were each diminished by 40%. Leaf mortality was slightly higher in C4 than C3 grasses, but leaf condition under drought otherwise showed no dependence on photosynthetic-type. This phylogenetically controlled experiment suggested that a drought-induced reduction in the photosynthetic performance advantages of C4 NADP-me relative to C3 grasses is a general phenomenon.

20971910|t|In vitro studies of peptidoglycan binding and hydrolysis by the Bacillus anthracis germination-specific lytic enzyme SleB.
20971910|a|The Bacillus anthracis endospore loses resistance properties during germination when its cortex peptidoglycan is degraded by germination-specific lytic enzymes (GSLEs). Although this event normally employs several GSLEs for complete cortex removal, the SleB protein alone can facilitate enough cortex hydrolysis to produce vulnerable spores. As a means to better understand its enzymatic function, SleB was overexpressed, purified, and tested in vitro for depolymerization of cortex by measurement of optical density loss and the solubilization of substrate. Its ability to bind peptidoglycan was also investigated. SleB functions independently as a lytic transglycosylase on both intact and fragmented cortex. Most of the muropeptide products that SleB generates are large and are potential substrates for other GSLEs present in the spore. Study of a truncated protein revealed that SleB has two domains. The N-terminal domain is required for stable peptidoglycan binding, while the C-terminal domain is the region of peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity. The C-terminal domain also exhibits dependence on cortex containing muramic-delta-lactam in order to carry out hydrolysis. As the conditions and limitations for SleB activity are further elucidated, they will enable the development of treatments that stimulate premature germination of B. anthracis spores, greatly simplifying decontamination measures.

20139283|a|Six strains of anaerobic, pleomorphic Gram-positive bacilli, isolated from the human oral cavity and an infected arm wound, were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolates were most closely related to Scardovia inopinata CCUG 35729(T) (94.8-94.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The isolates were saccharolytic and produced acetic and lactic acids as end products of fermentation. The major fatty acids were C(16 : 0) (49.8 %) and C(18 : 1)omega9c (35.8 %). Polar lipid analysis revealed a variety of glycolipids, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified phosphoglycolipid. No respiratory quinones were detected. The peptidoglycan was of the type A4alpha L-Lys-Thr-Glu, with L-lysine partially replaced by L-ornithine. The DNA G+C content of one of the strains, C1A_55(T)(,) was 55 mol%. A novel species, Scardovia wiggsiae sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate the six isolates, with the type strain C1A_55(T) (=DSM 22547(T)=CCUG 58090(T)).

20713166|t|Characterization of the Aspergillus nidulans biotin biosynthetic gene cluster and use of the bioDA gene as a new transformation marker.
20713166|a|The genes involved in the biosynthesis of biotin were identified in the hyphal fungus Aspergillus nidulans through homology searches and complementation of Escherichia coli biotin-auxotrophic mutants. Whereas the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase and dethiobiotin synthetase are encoded by distinct genes in bacteria and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both activities are performed in A. nidulans by a single enzyme, encoded by the bifunctional gene bioDA. Such a bifunctional bioDA gene is a genetic feature common to numerous members of the ascomycete filamentous fungi and basidiomycetes, as well as in plants and oomycota. However, unlike in other eukaryota, the three bio genes contributing to the four enzymatic steps from pimeloyl-CoA to biotin are organized in a gene cluster in pezizomycotina. The A. nidulans auxotrophic mutants biA1, biA2 and biA3 were all found to have mutations in the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase domain of the bioDA gene. Although biotin auxotrophy is an inconvenient marker in classical genetic manipulations due to cross-feeding of biotin, transformation of the biA1 mutant with the bioDA gene from either A. nidulans or Aspergillus fumigatus led to the recovery of well-defined biotin-prototrophic colonies. The usefulness of bioDA gene as a novel and robust transformation marker was demonstrated in co-transformation experiments with a green fluorescent protein reporter, and in the efficient deletion of the laccase (yA) gene via homologous recombination in a mutant lacking non-homologous end-joining activity.

21435061|t|Social immunity in honeybees (Apis mellifera): transcriptome analysis of varroa-hygienic behaviour.
21435061|a|Honeybees have evolved a social immunity consisting of the cooperation of individuals to decrease disease in the hive. We identified a set of genes involved in this social immunity by analysing the brain transcriptome of highly varroa-hygienic bees, who efficiently detect and remove brood infected with the Varroa destructor mite. The function of these candidate genes does not seem to support a higher olfactory sensitivity in hygienic bees, as previously hypothesized. However, comparing their genomic profile with those from other behaviours suggests a link with brood care and the highly varroa-hygienic Africanized honeybees. These results represent a first step toward the identification of genes involved in social immunity and thus provide first insights into the evolution of social immunity.

20154331|a|A novel acidiphilic, hydrogenotrophic methanogen, designated strain 6A8(T), was isolated from an acidic (pH 4.0-4.5) and ombrotrophic (rain-fed) bog located near Ithaca, NY, USA. Cultures were dimorphic, containing thin rods (0.2-0.3 mum in diameter and 0.8-3.0 mum long) and irregular cocci (0.2-0.8 mum in diameter). The culture utilized H(2)/CO(2) to produce methane but did not utilize formate, acetate, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, butanol or trimethylamine. Optimal growth conditions were near pH 5.1 and 35 ^0C. The culture grew in basal medium containing as little as 0.43 mM Na(+) and growth was inhibited completely by 50 mM NaCl. To our knowledge, strain 6A8(T) is one of the most acidiphilic (lowest pH optimum) and salt-sensitive methanogens in pure culture.

20880024|t|Adult predation risk drives shifts in parental care strategies: a long-term study.
20880024|a|1. Grouping provides antipredatory benefits, and therefore aggregation tendencies increase under heightened predation risk. In socially breeding groups, however, conflicts over reproductive shares or safety tend to disintegrate groups. Group formation thereby involves a balance between the antipredatory benefits of aggregation and the destabilizing effect of reproductive conflict. 2. We study the grouping behaviour of a facultatively social precocial sea duck with uniparental female care, the eider (Somateria mollissima Linnaeus). Females tend their young solitarily or in groups of 2-5 females. Here, we focus on the effect predation on adults has on group-formation decisions of brood-caring females. 3. By modifying an existing bidding game over care, we model the effects of predation risk on the width of the window of selfishness, which delimits the reproductive sharing allowing cooperation within brood-rearing coalitions, and generate predictions about the relative frequencies of solitary versus cooperative parental care modes. Furthermore, we model the dilution effect as a function of female group size and predation risk. 4. The window of selfishness widens with increasing predation risk, and the dilution of predation risk increases with both female group size and increasing predation risk, yielding the following predictions: (i) cooperative brood care becomes more prevalent and, conversely, solitary brood care less prevalent under heightened predation risk and (ii) group sizes increase concomitantly. 5. We tested these predictions using 13 years of data on female grouping decisions and annual predation rates, while controlling for the potentially confounding effect of female body condition. 6. Our data supported both predictions, where heightened predation risk of nesting females, but not changes in their condition, increased the relative frequency of cooperative brood care. Increased female nesting mortality also resulted in larger groups of cooperative females. 7. The predation risk of incubating females has long-term implications for later parental care decisions. We discuss the potential consequences of predation-induced shifts in group size on per capita fitness and population-wide productivity.

21269677|t|The rise of chronic non-communicable diseases in southeast Asia: time for action.
21269677|a|Southeast Asia faces an epidemic of chronic non-communicable diseases, now responsible for 60% of deaths in the region. The problem stems from environmental factors that promote tobacco use, unhealthy diet, and inadequate physical activity. Disadvantaged populations are the hardest hit, with death rates inversely proportional to a country's gross national income. Families shoulder the financial burden, but entire economies suffer as well. Although attempts to control non-communicable diseases are increasing, more needs to be done. Health-care systems need to be redesigned to deliver chronic care that is founded on existing primary health-care facilities, but supported by good referral systems. Surveillance of key modifiable risk factors is needed to monitor the magnitude of the problem and to study the effects of interventions. All branches of government and all sectors of society have to get involved in establishing environments that are conducive to healthy living. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is in a unique position to make a united stand against chronic non-communicable diseases in the region. Inaction will affect millions of lives-often, the lives of those who have the least.

21418209|t|Does variation in movement tactics and trophic interactions among American alligators create habitat linkages?
21418209|a|1. Highly mobile top predators are hypothesized to spatially and/or temporally link disparate habitats through the combination of their movement and feeding patterns, but recent studies suggest that individual specialization in habitat use and feeding could keep habitats compartmentalized. 2. We used passive acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analysis to investigate whether specialization in movement and feeding patterns of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in an oligotrophic subtropical estuary created habitat linkages between marine and estuarine/freshwater food webs. 3. Individual alligators adopted one of the three relatively distinct movement tactics that were linked to variation in diets. Fifty-six per cent of alligators regularly travelled from the upstream (freshwater/mid-estuary) areas into the downstream (marine-influenced) areas where salinities exceed those typically tolerated by alligators. Thirty-one per cent of the alligators made regular trips from the mid-estuarine habitat into the upstream habitat; 13% remained in the mid-estuary zone year-round. 4. Stable isotopic analysis indicated that, unlike individuals remaining in the mid-estuary and upstream zones, alligators that used the downstream zone fed at least partially from marine food webs and likely moved to access higher prey abundance at the expense of salt stress. Therefore, 'commuting' alligators may link marine food webs with those of the estuary and marshes in the coastal Everglades and create an upstream vector for allochthonous nutrient inputs into the estuary. 5. This study lends further support to the hypothesis that large-bodied highly mobile predators faced with trade-offs are likely to exhibit individual specialization leading to habitat linkages, rather than compartmentalization. However, the conditions under which this scenario occurs require further investigation.

21276754|t|Management of uncommon chemotherapy-induced emergencies.
21276754|a|Chemotherapy can induce various clinical emergencies. Prompt recognition and management of these adverse events are important for avoiding further morbidity and mortality. Some events such as hypersensitivity and extravasation are quite common, whereas emergencies such as neutropenic typhlitis, pancreatitis, and acute haemolysis are very rare. Little information exists on the management of rare chemotherapy-induced emergencies that affect fewer than 1% of patients. We review these uncommon chemotherapy-induced life-threatening emergencies, their pathogenesis and management, and recommendations for rechallenge with the offending chemotherapy.

21047958|t|Stepwise loss of fluorescent core protein V from human adenovirus during entry into cells.
21047958|a|Human adenoviruses (Ads) replicate and assemble particles in the nucleus. They organize a linear double-strand DNA genome into a condensed core with about 180 nucleosomes, by the viral proteins VII (pVII), pX, and pV attaching the DNA to the capsid. Using reverse genetics, we generated a novel, nonconditionally replicating Ad reporter by inserting green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the amino terminus of pV. Purified Ad2-GFP-pV virions had an oversized complete genome and incorporated about 38 GFP-pV molecules per virion, which is about 25% of the pV levels in Ad2. GFP-pV cofractionated with the DNA core, like pV, and newly synthesized GFP-pV had a subcellular localization indistinguishable from that of pV, indicating that GFP-pV is a valid reporter for pV. Ad2-GFP-pV completed the replication cycle, although at lower yields than Ad2. Incoming GFP-pV (or pV) was not imported into the nucleus. Virions lost GFP-pV at two points during the infection process: at entry into the cytosol and at the nuclear pore complex, where capsids disassemble. Disassembled capsids, positive for the conformation-specific antihexon antibody R70, were devoid of GFP-pV. The loss of GFP-pV was reduced by the macrolide antibiotic leptomycin B (LMB), which blocks nuclear export and adenovirus attachment to the nuclear pore complex. LMB inhibited the appearance of R70 epitopes on Ad2 and Ad2-GFP-pV, indicating that the loss of GFP-pV from Ad2-GFP-pV is an authentic step in the adenovirus uncoating program. Ad2-GFP-pV is genetically complete and hence enables detailed analyses of infection and spreading dynamics in cells and model organisms or assessment of oncolytic adenoviral potential.

21521143|t|Post-egression host tissue feeding is another strategy of host regulation by the Koinobiont wasp, Toxoneuron nigriceps.
21521143|a|Koinobiont wasps start their lives as hemolymph feeders inside the host body, but before they egress from the host many become tissue predators. One species, the endoparasitoid Toxoneuron nigriceps Viereck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), exhibits the unusual behavior of egressing before initiating tissue predation. After egression from the host, it reinserts its head into the host body to begin tissue feeding. These third instar T. nigriceps larvae show a significant increase in body size and mass after post-egression feeding. Through this project the importance of post-egression feeding in the development of T. nigriceps in its host the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), has been evaluated. The study was conducted by preventing the egressed third instar T. nigriceps larvae from feeding on host tissue and observing whether they could undergo further development. Though some of the larvae that were prevented from post-egression feeding did undergo cocoon formation, pupation, and adult emergence they were inferior in terms of size, body mass, and survival to those that developed from larvae allowed to feeding after egression. Hence, it is concluded that post-egression host tissue feeding is essential for the normal development of T. nigriceps, as the prevention of feeding resulted in significantly lighter and smaller larvae, cocoons, and adults as well as deformed adults and reduced adult survival. Post-egression feeding as a host regulatory strategy is discussed.

20173002|t|Litoreibacter albidus gen. nov., sp. nov. and Litoreibacter janthinus sp. nov., members of the class Alphaproteobacteria isolated from the seashore.
20173002|a|Two Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile bacteria designated strains KMM 3851(T) and KMM 3842(T) were respectively isolated from a marine snail specimen (Umbonium costatum) and from surrounding sediments collected simultaneously from the shore of the Sea of Japan. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains KMM 3851(T) and KMM 3842(T) were affiliated with the Roseobacter lineage of the class Alphaproteobacteria as a separate phylogenetic line adjacent to the members of the genus Thalassobacter. These novel isolates shared 98.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and 15 % DNA-DNA relatedness. The major isoprenoid quinone of both strains was Q-10 and polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and aminophospholipids. In addition, strain KMM 3851(T) contained two unknown lipids, whereas strain KMM 3842(T) contained diphosphatidylglycerol. Fatty acid analysis revealed C(18 : 1)omega7c and C(16 : 0) as major components and small amounts of C(18 : 2). The DNA G+C contents were 60.4 mol% (KMM 3851(T)) and 58.5 mol% (KMM 3842(T)). Based on distinctive phenotypic characteristics, DNA-DNA hybridization data and phylogenetic distance, strains KMM 3851(T) and KMM 3842(T) should be classified as representatives of two novel species in a new genus, Litoreibacter gen. nov., with the type species Litoreibacter albidus sp. nov. (type strain KMM 3851(T) =NRIC 0773(T) =JCM 16493(T)) and a second species Litoreibacter janthinus sp. nov. (type strain KMM 3842(T) =NRIC 0772(T) =JCM 16492(T)).

22008745|t|Identification and characterization of a putative basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in the early stage of conidiophore development in Aspergillus oryzae.
22008745|a|The helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of transcriptional factors is a key player in a wide range of developmental processes. HLH proteins form homo- and/or heterodimers with other HLH proteins and bind to E-box motifs. The regulation and functions of these proteins can be complex due to their bifunctional roles as activators and repressors of gene transcription. In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel predicted bHLH protein-encoding gene, AO090023000902, designated ecdR (early conidiophore development regulator), in Aspergillus oryzae. The ecdR gene disruptant produced very few conidia. Conversely, the overexpression of ecdR resulted in the formation of a large number of conidia at an early stage, suggesting that the EcdR protein is required for early asexual development. Additionally, when serially diluted conidia were spread-cultivated onto malt agar medium, we found that conidial number of the control strain depended on the cultivated conidium density, while the ecdR-overexpressing strain showed no significant change in conidiation. These phenotypes of ecdR-disruptant and ecdR-overexpressing strains are partially similar to those of the sclR-overexpressing strain and sclR-disruptant, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid assays and sclR, ecdR-double deletion experiment indicated that EcdR plays a major role in conidiation, and SclR represses this function by competitively interacting with EcdR in A. oryzae.

20154329|t|Streptomyces hyderabadensis sp. nov., an actinomycete isolated from soil.
20154329|a|A novel actinomycete, designated strain OU-40(T), was isolated from farm soil collected from the Hyderabad region of Andhra Pradesh, southern India. The strain was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of species of the genus Streptomyces. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain OU-40(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces, and was related most closely to Streptomyces pactum NBRC 13433(T) (99.0 % sequence similarity), Streptomyces olivaceus NBRC 12805(T) (99.0 %) and Streptomyces parvulus NBRC 13193(T) (98.8 %). Strain OU-40(T) could be distinguished from the type strains of its closest phylogenetic relatives based on levels of DNA-DNA relatedness and comparison of morphological and phenotypic data. It is therefore concluded that strain OU-40(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces hyderabadensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is OU-40(T) (=CCTCC AA 209024(T) =PCM 2692(T)).

21256455|t|Mechanisms of epileptogenesis and potential treatment targets.
21256455|a|Prevention of epileptogenesis after brain trauma is an unmet medical challenge. Recent molecular profiling studies have provided an insight into molecular changes that contribute to formation of ictogenic neuronal networks, including genes regulating synaptic or neuronal plasticity, cell death, proliferation, and inflammatory or immune responses. These mechanisms have been targeted to prevent epileptogenesis in animal models. Favourable effects have been obtained using immunosuppressants, antibodies blocking adhesion of leucocytes to endothelial cells, gene therapy driving expression of neurotrophic factors, pharmacological neurostimulation, or even with conventional antiepileptic drugs by administering them before the appearance of genetic epilepsy. Further studies are needed to clarify the optimum time window and aetiological specificity of treatments. Questions related to adverse events also need further consideration. Encouragingly, the recent experimental studies emphasise that the complicated process of epileptogenesis can be favourably modified, and that antiepileptogenesis as a treatment indication might not be an impossible mission.

21492929|t|Serotype replacement in disease after pneumococcal vaccination.
21492929|a|Vaccination with heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has significantly reduced the burden of pneumococcal disease and has had an important public health benefit. Because this vaccine targets only seven of the more than 92 pneumococcal serotypes, concerns have been raised that non-vaccine serotypes (NVTs) could increase in prevalence and reduce the benefits of vaccination. Indeed, among asymptomatic carriers, the prevalence of NVTs has increased substantially, and consequently, there has been little or no net change in the bacterial carriage prevalence. In many populations, pneumococcal disease caused by NVT has increased, but in most cases this increase has been less than the increase in NVT carriage. We review the evidence for serotype replacement in carriage and disease, and address the surveillance biases that might affect these findings. We then discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between near-complete replacement in carriage and partial replacement for disease, including differences in invasiveness between vaccine serotypes. We contend that the magnitude of serotype replacement in disease can be attributed, in part, to a combination of lower invasiveness of the replacing serotypes, biases in the pre-vaccine carriage data (unmasking), and biases in the disease surveillance systems that could underestimate the true amount of replacement. We conclude by discussing the future potential for serotype replacement in disease and the need for continuing surveillance.

21198588|t|Spatio-temporal variation in territory quality and oxidative status: a natural experiment in the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis).
21198588|a|1. Fluctuations in the quality of the habitat in which an animal lives can have major consequences for its behaviour and physiological state. In poor-quality habitat with low food availability, metabolically intensive foraging activity is likely to result in increased generation of reactive oxygen species, while scarcity of food can lead to a weakening of exogenously derived antioxidant defences. The consequent oxidant/antioxidant imbalance may lead to elevated oxidative stress. 2. Although the link between food availability and oxidative stress has been studied in the laboratory, very little is known about this relationship in the wild. Here, we investigate the association between territory quality (measured through food availability) and oxidative stress in the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis). 3. Seychelles warblers are insectivorous birds that inhabit a fixed feeding territory year round. Individuals experience profound and rapid local fluctuations in territory quality within these territories, owing to changing patterns of vegetation defoliation resulting from seasonal changes in prevailing wind direction and wind-borne salt spray. 4. As expected, oxidant generation (measured as reactive oxygen metabolites; ROMs) was higher when territory quality was low, but there was no correlation between territory quality and antioxidant capacity (OXY). The negative correlation between territory quality and ROMs was significant between individuals and approached significance within individuals, indicating that the pattern resulted from individual responses to environmental variation. 5. ROMs and OXY levels within individuals were positively correlated, but the relationship between territory quality and ROMs persisted after including OXY as a covariate, implying that oxidative stress occurs in low territory quality conditions. 6. Our results indicate that the oxidative stress balance of an individual is sensitive to relatively short-term changes in territory quality, which may have consequences for the birds' fitness.

20863856|t|Expression of the C-terminal ORF2 protein of duck astrovirus for application in a serological test.
20863856|a|Duck astrovirus (DAstV) is an important pathogen causing duck viral hepatitis (DVH), a highly contagious and fatal disease in young ducklings. To provide an antigen for a diagnostic serum test, the C-terminus of DAstV ORF2 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. Four positive and 30 negative sera were used to validate the purified ORF2 protein by developing an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No cross-reactions were found against other duck pathogens, including duck hepatitis A virus, duck plague herpesvirus, duck reovirus, Newcastle disease virus, and Riemerella anatipestifer 12/19 (63.2%) and 26/51 (51%) sera samples from two flocks of ducks that survived DAstV infections in commercial duck farms were positive for DAstV by this method, respectively. Interestingly, DAstV-specific antibodies were also detected in 12 (28.6%) of 42 sera samples from a different flock without DVH, indicating a wide distribution of subclinical infections caused by DAstV.

21097613|t|Primosomal proteins DnaD and DnaB are recruited to chromosomal regions bound by DnaA in Bacillus subtilis.
21097613|a|The initiation of DNA replication requires the binding of the initiator protein, DnaA, to specific binding sites in the chromosomal origin of replication, oriC. DnaA also binds to many sites around the chromosome, outside oriC, and acts as a transcription factor at several of these. In low-G+C Gram-positive bacteria, the primosomal proteins DnaD and DnaB, in conjunction with loader ATPase DnaI, load the replicative helicase at oriC, and this depends on DnaA. DnaD and DnaB also are required to load the replicative helicase outside oriC during replication restart, independently of DnaA. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that DnaD and DnaB, but not the replicative helicase, are associated with many of the chromosomal regions bound by DnaA in Bacillus subtilis. This association was dependent on DnaA, and the order of recruitment was the same as that at oriC, but it was independent of a functional oriC and suggests that DnaD and DnaB do not require open complex formation for the stable association with DNA. These secondary binding regions for DnaA could be serving as a reservoir for excess DnaA, DnaD, and DnaB to help properly regulate replication initiation and perhaps are analogous to the proposed function of the datA locus in Escherichia coli. Alternatively, DnaD and DnaB might modulate the activity of DnaA at the secondary binding regions. All three of these proteins are widely conserved and likely have similar functions in a range of organisms.

21148731|a|The periplasmic protein ApbE was identified through the analysis of several mutants defective in thiamine biosynthesis and was implicated as having a role in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis or repair. While mutations in apbE cause decreased activity of several iron-sulfur enzymes in vivo, the specific role of ApbE remains unknown. Members of the AbpE family include NosX and RnfF, which have been implicated in oxidation-reduction associated with nitrous oxide and nitrogen metabolism, respectively. In this work, we show that ApbE binds one FAD molecule per monomeric unit. The structure of ApbE in the presence of bound FAD reveals a new FAD-binding motif. Protein variants that are nonfunctional in vivo were generated by random and targeted mutagenesis. Each variant was substituted in the environment of the FAD and analyzed for FAD binding after reconstitution. The variant that altered a key tyrosine residue involved in FAD binding prevented reconstitution of the protein.

21037011|a|Here, we report on the first completely annotated genome sequence of a Bifidobacterium bifidum strain. B. bifidum S17, isolated from feces of a breast-fed infant, was shown to strongly adhere to intestinal epithelial cells and has potent anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo. The genome sequence will provide new insights into the biology of this potential probiotic organism and allow for the characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying its beneficial properties.

20962094|t|Yeast-elicited cross-reactive antibodies to HIV Env glycans efficiently neutralize virions expressing exclusively high-mannose N-linked glycans.
20962094|a|The HIV envelope (Env) protein uses a dense coat of glycans to mask conserved domains and evade host humoral immune responses. The broadly neutralizing antibody 2G12, which binds a specific cluster of high-mannose glycans on HIV Env, shows that the glycan shield can also serve as a target for neutralizing antibodies. We have described a triple mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that expresses high-mannose glycoproteins that bind to 2G12. When used to immunize rabbits, this yeast elicits antibodies that bind to gp120-associated glycans but fail to neutralize virus. Here we sought to determine the reason for these discordant results. Affinity purification of sera over columns conjugated with three 2G12-reactive yeast glycoproteins showed that these proteins could adsorb 80% of the antibodies that bind to gp120 glycans. Despite binding to monomeric gp120, these mannose-specific antibodies failed to bind cell surface-expressed trimeric Env. However, when Env was expressed in the presence of the mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine to force retention of high-mannose glycans at all sites, the purified antibodies gained the abilities to bind trimeric Env and to strongly and broadly neutralize viruses produced under these conditions. Combined, these data show that the triple mutant yeast strain elicits antibodies that bind to high-mannose glycans presented on the HIV envelope, but only when they are displayed in a manner not found on native Env trimers. This implies that the underlying structure of the protein scaffold used to present the high-mannose glycans may be critical to allow elicitation of antibodies that recognize trimeric Env and neutralize virus.

20825578|t|Drought increases freezing tolerance of both leaves and xylem of Larrea tridentata.
20825578|a|Drought and freezing are both known to limit desert plant distributions, but the interaction of these stressors is poorly understood. Drought may increase freezing tolerance in leaves while decreasing it in the xylem, potentially creating a mismatch between water supply and demand. To test this hypothesis, we subjected Larrea tridentata juveniles grown in a greenhouse under well-watered or drought conditions to minimum temperatures ranging from -8 to -24 ^0C. We measured survival, leaf retention, gas exchange, cell death, freezing point depression and leaf-specific xylem hydraulic conductance (k1). Drought-exposed plants exhibited smaller decreases in gas exchange after exposure to -8 ^0C compared to well-watered plants. Drought also conferred a significant positive effect on leaf, xylem and whole-plant function following exposure to -15 ^0C; drought-exposed plants exhibited less cell death, greater leaf retention, higher k1 and higher rates of gas exchange than well-watered plants. Both drought-exposed and well-watered plants experienced 100% mortality following exposure to -24 ^0C. By documenting the combined effects of drought and freezing stress, our data provide insight into the mechanisms determining plant survival and performance following freezing and the potential for shifts in L. tridentata abundance and range in the face of changing temperature and precipitation regimes.

21526926|t|Nesting biology and fungiculture of the fungus-growing ant, Mycetagroicus cerradensis: new light on the origin of higher attine agriculture.
21526926|a|The genus Mycetagroicus is perhaps the least known of all fungus-growing ant genera, having been first described in 2001 from museum specimens. A recent molecular phylogenetic analysis of the fungus-growing ants demonstrated that Mycetagroicus is the sister to all higher attine ants (Trachymyrmex, Sericomyrmex, Acromyrmex, Pseudoatta, and Atta), making it of extreme importance for understanding the transition between lower and higher attine agriculture. Four nests of Mycetagroicus cerradensis near Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil were excavated, and fungus chambers for one were located at a depth of 3.5 meters. Based on its lack of gongylidia (hyphal-tip swellings typical of higher attine cultivars), and a phylogenetic analysis of the ITS rDNA gene region, M. cerradensis cultivates a lower attine fungus in Clade 2 of lower attine (G3) fungi. This finding refines a previous estimate for the origin of higher attine agriculture, an event that can now be dated at approximately 21-25 mya in the ancestor of extant species of Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex.

20840608|t|Rarity, life history and scaling of the dynamics in time and space of British birds.
20840608|a|1. Many patterns in macroecology are closely related to the total abundance of a species in a region. Here we show that interspecific differences in the pattern of population fluctuations of British bird species can be predicted from knowledge of their overall abundance and some basic life-history characteristics. 2. We identify a rarity syndrome that arises through an increased stochastic influence on population fluctuations with decreasing population size, mainly resulting from an inverse density-dependent effect of demographic stochasticity. This syndrome involves an increase in the annual changes in population size with increasing rarity in the United Kingdom. 3. The relationship between the magnitude of temporal variation and local mean population size differs between species dependent on their life history, i.e. species with larger clutch size and lower survival tended to have larger annual changes in population size than low-reproducing long-lived species. 4. The probability of local disappearance from a study plot depended on the population size and was hence closely related to the overall abundance of the species in UK. For a given population size, this probability was also related to species-specific life-history characteristics, being higher in species with larger clutch sizes and smaller survival rates. 5. Rareness results in a spatial decoupling of the temporal variation in population size. 6. These patterns show that once a species has become rare, e.g. due to human activities, key population dynamical characteristics will change because of density-dependent stochastic effects, which in turn are dependent on species-specific life-history characteristics.

20946420|t|Association between nonsynonymous mutations of starch synthase IIa and starch quality in rice (Oryza sativa).
20946420|a|Starch quality is one of the most important agronomic traits in Asian rice, Oryza sativa. Starch synthase IIa (SsIIa) is a major candidate gene for starch quality variation. Within SsIIa, three nonsynonymous mutations in exon 8 have been shown to affect enzyme activity when expressed in Escherichia coli. To search for the variation in SsIIa that is responsible for starch quality variation in rice, we sequenced the SsIIa exon 8 region and measured starch quality as starch disintegration in alkali for 289 accessions of cultivated rice and 57 accessions of its wild ancestor, Oryza rufipogon. A general linear model and nested clade analysis were used to identify the associations between the three nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and starch quality. Among the three nonsynonymous SNPs, we found strong evidence of association at one nucleotide site ('SNP 3'), corresponding to a Leu/Phe replacement at codon 781. A second SNP, corresponding to a Val/Met replacement at codon 737, could potentially show an association with increased sample sizes. Variation in SsIIa enzyme activity is associated with the cohesiveness of rice grains when cooked, and our findings are consistent with selection for more cohesive grains during the domestication of tropical japonica rice.

20971905|t|The nodulation of alfalfa by the acid-tolerant Rhizobium sp. strain LPU83 does not require sulfated forms of lipochitooligosaccharide nodulation signals.
20971905|a|The induction of root nodules by the majority of rhizobia has a strict requirement for the secretion of symbiosis-specific lipochitooligosaccharides (nodulation factors [NFs]). The nature of the chemical substitution on the NFs depends on the particular rhizobium and contributes to the host specificity imparted by the NFs. We present here a description of the genetic organization of the nod gene cluster and the characterization of the chemical structure of the NFs associated with the broad-host-range Rhizobium sp. strain LPU83, a bacterium capable of nodulating at least alfalfa, bean, and Leucena leucocephala. The nod gene cluster was located on the plasmid pLPU83b. The organization of the cluster showed synteny with those of the alfalfa-nodulating rhizobia, Sinorhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium medicae. Interestingly, the strongest sequence similarity observed was between the partial nod sequences of Rhizobium mongolense USDA 1844 and the corresponding LPU83 nod genes sequences. The phylogenetic analysis of the intergenic region nodEG positions strain LPU83 and the type strain R. mongolense 1844 in the same branch, which indicates that Rhizobium sp. strain LPU83 might represent an early alfalfa-nodulating genotype. The NF chemical structures obtained for the wild-type strain consist of a trimeric, tetrameric, and pentameric chitin backbone that shares some substitutions with both alfalfa- and bean-nodulating rhizobia. Remarkably, while in strain LPU83 most of the NFs were sulfated in their reducing terminal residue, none of the NFs isolated from the nodH mutant LPU83-H were sulfated. The evidence obtained supports the notion that the sulfate decoration of NFs in LPU83 is not necessary for alfalfa nodulation.

21600845|t|Physiological and molecular evidence that environmental changes elicit morphological interconversion in the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.
21600845|a|Over the last decades Phaeodactylum tricornutum has become a model to study diatom biology at the molecular level. Cells have the peculiarity to be pleiomorphic and it is thought that this character is triggered by culture conditions, although few quantitative studies have been performed and nothing is known at the molecular level. Our aim was to quantify the effect of growth conditions on cell morphology of different P. tricornutum strains by quantitative microscopy, cellular imaging, and non-targeted transcriptomics. We show that morphotype changes can be regulated by changing culture conditions, depending on the strain, and show a common trend of increased oval cell abundance as a response to stress. Examination of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from triradiate cells infers the importance of osmoregulation in the maintenance of this morphotype, whereas ESTs derived from oval cells grown in hyposaline and low temperature conditions show a predominance of genes encoding typical components of stress pathways, especially in signaling, cell homeostasis and lipid metabolism. This work contributes to better understand the importance of the unique capability of morphotype conversion in P. tricornutum and its relevance in acclimation to changing environmental conditions.

20971912|t|The Rcs signal transduction pathway is triggered by enterobacterial common antigen structure alterations in Serratia marcescens.
20971912|a|The enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) is a highly conserved exopolysaccharide in Gram-negative bacteria whose role remains largely uncharacterized. In a previous work, we have demonstrated that disrupting the integrity of the ECA biosynthetic pathway imposed severe deficiencies to the Serratia marcescens motile (swimming and swarming) capacity. In this work, we show that alterations in the ECA structure activate the Rcs phosphorelay, which results in the repression of the flagellar biogenesis regulatory cascade. In addition, a detailed analysis of wec cluster mutant strains, which provoke the disruption of the ECA biosynthesis at different levels of the pathway, suggests that the absence of the periplasmic ECA cyclic structure could constitute a potential signal detected by the RcsF-RcsCDB phosphorelay. We also identify SMA1167 as a member of the S. marcescens Rcs regulon and show that high osmolarity induces Rcs activity in this bacterium. These results provide a new perspective from which to understand the phylogenetic conservation of ECA among enterobacteria and the basis for the virulence attenuation detected in wec mutant strains in other pathogenic bacteria.

21073455|t|Effects of early horn growth on reproduction and hunting mortality in female chamois.
21073455|a|1. Environmental conditions during early development can affect the growth patterns of vertebrates, influencing future survival and reproduction. In long-lived mammals, females that experience poor environmental conditions early in life may delay primiparity. In female bovids, annual horn growth increments may provide a record of age-specific reproduction and body growth. Horn length, however, may also be a criterion used by hunters in selecting animals to harvest, possibly leading to artificial selection. 2. We studied three populations of chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) in the western Alps to explore the relationships between female horn length and early growth, age of primiparity and age-specific reproduction. We also compared the risk of harvest to reproductive status and horn length. 3. Early horn growth was positively correlated with body mass in pre-reproductive females and with reproduction in very young and senescent adults. Females with strong early horn growth attained primiparity at an earlier age than those with weak early growth. Horn length did not affect hunter selection, but we found a strong hunter preference for nonlactating females. 4. Our research highlights the persistent effects of early development on reproductive performance in mammals. Moderate sport harvests are unlikely to affect the evolution of phenotypic traits and reproductive strategies in female chamois. A policy of penalizing hunters that harvest lactating females, however, may increase the harvest of 2-year-old females, which have high reproductive potential.

21784165|t|Functions of the mitotic B-type cyclins CLB1, CLB2, and CLB3 at mitotic exit antagonized by the CDC14 phosphatase.
21784165|a|In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell cycle progression and cytokinesis at mitotic exit are proposed to be linked by CDC14 phosphatase antagonizing the function of mitotic B-type cyclin (CLBs). We have isolated a temperature-sensitive mutant, cdc14(A280V), with a mutation in the conserved phosphatase domain. Prolonged arrest in the cdc14(A280V) mutant partially uncoupled cell cycle progression from the completion of cytokinesis as measured by bud re-emergence, in the form of elongated apical projections, and DNA re-replication. In contrast to previous mitotic exit mutants, cdc14(A280V) mutants displayed a strong bias for the first apical projection to form in the mother cell body. Using cdc14(A280V) mutant phenotypes, the functions of the B-type cyclins at mitotic exit were investigated. The preference in mother-daughter apical projection formation was observed to be independent of any individual CLB function. However, cdc14(A280V)clb1Delta cells displayed a pronounced increase in apical projections, while cdc14(A280V)clb3Delta cells were observed to form round cellular chains. While cdc14(A280V) cells arrested at mitotic exit, both cdc14(A280V)clb1Delta and cdc14(A280V)clb3Delta cells completed cytokinesis, but failed cell separation. cdc14(A280V)clb2Delta cells displayed a defect in actin ring assembly. These observations differentiate the functions of CLB1, CLB2, and CLB3 at mitotic exit, and are consistent with the hypothesis that CLB activities are antagonized by the CDC14 phosphatase in order to couple cell cycle progression with cytokinesis at mitotic exit.

21188839|t|Breathing some air into the single-species vacuum: multi-species responses to environmental change.
21188839|a|Studies of ecological responses to climate change have often analysed species independently of each other, yet interactions between species are fundamental aspects of ecology. Mutshinda, O'Hara &amp; Woiwod (2011) used light-trapping data for Lepidoptera (moths) to examine population responses to intraspecific effects and effects of winter rainfall and temperature. They show how Bayesian hierarchical models can analyse residual correlations among species' responses, illustrating an approach to account for and measure dependencies that are not fully explained by the candidate explanatory variables. A key result is that the responses of the different moth species did not appear to have strong residual correlation (Mutshinda, O'Hara &amp; Woiwod 2011). These analyses provide an approach for synthesising across species and can better inform ecological responses to environmental change.

21929695|t|Overexpression of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, CYP6ER1, is associated with resistance to imidacloprid in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens.
21929695|a|The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, is an economically significant pest of rice throughout Asia and has evolved resistance to many insecticides including the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. The resistance of field populations of N. lugens to imidacloprid has been attributed to enhanced detoxification by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), although, to date, the causative P450(s) has (have) not been identified. In the present study, biochemical assays using the model substrate 7-ethoxycoumarin showed enhanced P450 activity in several resistant N. lugens field strains when compared with a susceptible reference strain. Thirty three cDNA sequences encoding tentative unique P450s were identified from two recent sequencing projects and by degenerate PCR. The mRNA expression level of 32 of these was examined in susceptible, moderately resistant and highly resistant N. lugens strains using quantitative real-time PCR. A single P450 gene (CYP6ER1) was highly overexpressed in all resistant strains (up to 40-fold) and the level of expression observed in the different N. lugens strains was significantly correlated with the resistance phenotype. These results provide strong evidence for a role of CYP6ER1 in the resistance of N. lugens to imidacloprid.

20880203|t|Generation of Se-fortified broccoli as functional food: impact of Se fertilization on S metabolism.
20880203|a|Selenium (Se)-fortified broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) has been proposed as a functional food for cancer prevention, based on its high glucosinolate (GSL) content and capacity for Se accumulation. However, as selenate and sulphate share the initial assimilation route, Se fertilization could interfere with sulphur metabolism and plant growth. Consequently, GSL accumulation could be compromised. To evaluate these potentially adverse effects of Se fertilization, we performed a comprehensive study on sand-grown young broccoli plants (weekly selenate applications of 0.8 mumol plant(-1) via the root) and field-grown adult broccoli plants during head formation (single foliar selenate application: 25.3 or 253 mumol plant(-1) ). The results show that under these conditions, Se application does not affect plant growth, contents of cysteine, glutathione, total GSL, glucoraphanin (major aliphatic GSL) or the expression of BoMYB28 (encoding a functionally confirmed master regulator for aliphatic GSL biosynthesis). Conversely, due to the changed expression of sulphate transporters (BoSULTR1;1, 1;2, 2;1, and 2;2), sulphate and total S contents increased in the shoot of young plants while decreasing in the root. We conclude that broccoli can be fertilized with Se without reduction in GSL content, even with Se accumulation exceeding the level recommended for human consumption.

20796205|t|Analysis of spatial niche structure in coexisting tidepool fishes: null models based on multi-scale experiments.
20796205|a|1. Fundamental and realized spatial niches were investigated through a combination of laboratory and mesocosm experiments, field observations and null model analysis in three intertidal gobiid species (Bathygobius fuscus, Chaenogobius annularis and C. gulosus). Null models based on the results of single-species experiments were used to assess interspecific spatial use and coexistence on two different scales: (i) microhabitats within a tidepool ('microhabitat' scale); and (ii) distribution among a set of tidepools ('habitat-wide' scale). 2. Patterns of microhabitat use varied from single to paired treatments, depending on paired species. Realized overlap of microhabitat use was smaller than would be expected from single-individual situations for intraspecific combinations, but not for interspecific ones. 3. Patterns of tidepool occupancy (a measure of spatial niche breadth) in the mesocosm were influenced by interspecific interactions. Two Chaenogobius species, but not B. fuscus, decreased tidepool occupancy in the hetero-specific treatments compared with the mono-specific ones. For all interspecific combinations, spatial overlap (habitat-wide scale) was significantly lower than the values expected from mono-specific situations. The results also indicated a possible trade-off between competitiveness and growth efficiency in these fishes. 4. Interspecific spatial overlap in the field was similar to that in the mesocosm experiment and the pattern of coexistence of gobiids can be explained by the results of our experiments. 5. This study demonstrates that niches of intertidal fishes may experience modifications under the influence of species interactions and that null models based on controlled experiments can greatly facilitate the deciphering of such changes in niche structure.

22182616|t|The ability of selected pupal parasitoids (hymenoptera: pteromalidae) to locate stable fly hosts in a soiled equine bedding substrate.
22182616|a|The ability of Spalangia cameroni Perkins, Spalangia endius Walker, and Muscidifurax raptorellus Kogan and Legner to locate and attack stable fly hosts was evaluated under laboratory conditions. Postfeeding third-instar stable fly larvae were released and allowed to pupate in two arena types: large 4.8 liter chambers containing a field-collected, soiled equine bedding substrate; or 120-ml plastic cups containing wood chips. At the time of fly pupariation, parasitoids were released and permitted 72 h to locate and attack hosts. On average, parasitism rates of freely accessible stable fly pupae in cups were not significantly different between parasitoid species. However, parasitism rates in chambers containing either Spalangia spp. were =50-fold more than M. raptorellus. Additional intraspecies analysis revealed that parasitism rates both by S. cameroni and S. endius were not significantly different when pupae were freely accessible or within bedding, whereas M. raptorellus attacked significantly more pupae in cups than in the larger chambers where hosts were distributed within bedding. These results suggest that Spalangia spp. are more suited to successfully locate and attack hosts in habitats created by equine husbandry in Florida. Therefore, commercially available parasitoid mixtures containing Muscidifurax spp. may be ineffective if used as a control measure at Florida equine facilities.

20962093|t|Human pluripotent stem cells produce natural killer cells that mediate anti-HIV-1 activity by utilizing diverse cellular mechanisms.
20962093|a|Cell-based therapies against HIV/AIDS have been gaining increased interest. Natural killer (NK) cells are a key component of the innate immune system with the ability to kill diverse tumor cells and virus-infected cells. While NK cells have been shown to play an important role in the control of HIV-1 replication, their functional activities are often compromised in HIV-1-infected individuals. We have previously demonstrated the derivation of NK cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with the ability to potently kill multiple types of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. We now demonstrate the derivation of functional NK cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). More importantly, both hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells are able to inhibit HIV-1 NL4-3 infection of CEM-GFP cells. Additional studies using HIV-1-infected human primary CD4(+) T cells illustrated that hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells suppress HIV-1 infection by at least three distinct cellular mechanisms: killing of infected targets through direct lysis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and production of chemokines and cytokines. Our results establish the potential to utilize hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells to better understand anti-HIV-1 immunity and provide a novel cellular immunotherapeutic approach to treat HIV/AIDS.

20980500|t|Differential regulation of human papillomavirus type 8 by interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7.
20980500|a|The genus Beta human papillomavirus (HPV) type 8 is associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, and evidence for its protumorigenic potential in the general population increases. To date, strategies to suppress genus Beta HPV infections are limited. Interferon regulatory factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 play key roles in the activation of the innate immune response to viral infections. In this study, we show for the first time that both IRF-3 and IRF-7 regulate transcription of a papillomavirus, but with opposing effects. IRF-7, expressed in the suprabasal layers of human epidermis, increased HPV8 late promoter activity via direct binding to viral DNA. UV-B light-induced activation of the HPV8 promoter involved IRF-7 as a downstream effector. In contrast, IRF-3, expressed in all layers of human epidermis, induced strong HPV8 suppression in primary keratinocytes. IRF-3-mediated suppression prevailed over IRF-7-induced HPV8 transcription. Unlike the E6 oncoprotein of the mucosal high-risk HPV16, the HPV8 E6 protein did not bind to IRF-3 and only weakly antagonized its activity. Strong antiviral activity was also observed, when keratinocytes were treated with potent IRF-3 activators, poly(I:C) or RNA bearing 5' phosphates. In conclusion, we show that IRF-3 activation induces a state of cell-autonomous immunity against HPV in primary human keratinocytes. Our study suggests that local application of IRF-3-activating compounds might constitute an attractive novel therapeutic strategy against HPV8-associated diseases, particularly in epidermodysplasia verruciformis patients.

20962101|t|Hepatitis C virus NS2 protein serves as a scaffold for virus assembly by interacting with both structural and nonstructural proteins.
20962101|a|Many aspects of the assembly of hepatitis C virus (HCV) remain incompletely understood. To characterize the role of NS2 in the production of infectious virus, we determined NS2 interaction partners among other HCV proteins during productive infection. Pulldown assays showed that NS2 forms complexes with both structural and nonstructural proteins, including E1, E2, p7, NS3, and NS5A. Confocal microscopy also demonstrated that NS2 colocalizes with E1, E2, and NS5A in dot-like structures near lipid droplets. However, NS5A did not coprecipitate with E2 and interacted only weakly with NS3 in pulldown assays. Also, there was no demonstrable interaction between p7 and E2 or NS3 in such assays. Therefore, NS2 is uniquely capable of interacting with both structural and nonstructural proteins. Among mutations in p7, NS2, and NS3 that prevent production of infectious virus, only p7 mutations significantly reduced NS2-mediated protein interactions. These p7 mutations altered the intracellular distribution of NS2 and E2 and appeared to modulate the membrane topology of the C-terminal domain of NS2. These results suggest that NS2 acts to coordinate virus assembly by mediating interactions between envelope proteins and NS3 and NS5A within replication complexes adjacent to lipid droplets, where virus particle assembly is thought to occur. p7 may play an accessory role by regulating NS2 membrane topology, which is important for NS2-mediated protein interactions and therefore NS2 function.

21070858|t|Activation and localization of protein kinase C in Neurospora crassa.
21070858|a|The Neurosporacrassa protein kinase C (NPKC) is reported to be a regulator of light responsive genes. It phosphorylates the light receptor WC-1 and regulates the levels of the circadian clock protein FRQ and transcription of the light-induced albino-2 gene. In mammals, the conventional and novel isoforms of PKC are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG), which induces PKC translocation from the cytoplasm to membranes. To investigate the interaction of NPKC and DAG in Neurospora, we constructed a strain that expresses a PKC-GFP fusion protein. We found that NPKC localizes to growing tips and sub-apical plasma membrane in actively growing hyphae, and actively participates in septum development. NPKC is activated by exogenous DAG and phorbol esters, and translocates to the plasma membrane from the cytoplasm. We have previously reported that choline depletion of the chol-1 mutant of Neurospora increases DAG levels and lengthens the period of the circadian rhythm of conidiation. We have found that the activity of NPKC is rhythmic, and that NPKC levels are increased on choline depletion. However, over-expression of NPKC did not lengthen the conidiation period, indicating that PKC in Neurospora may not be responsible for the lengthened period in low choline cultures.

20971898|t|Nucleotide parasitism by Simkania negevensis (Chlamydiae).
20971898|a|Intracellular bacteria live in an environment rich in most essential metabolites but need special mechanisms to access these substrates. Nucleotide transport proteins (NTTs) catalyze the import of ATP and other nucleotides from the eukaryotic host into the bacterial cell and render de novo synthesis of these compounds dispensable. The draft genome sequence of Simkania negevensis strain Z, a chlamydial organism considered a newly emerging pathogen, revealed four genes encoding putative nucleotide transport proteins (SnNTT1 to SnNTT4), all of which are transcribed during growth of S. negevensis in Acanthamoeba host cells, as confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR. Using heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, we could show that SnNTT1 functions as an ATP/ADP antiporter, SnNTT2 as a guanine nucleotide/ATP/H(+) symporter driven by the membrane potential, and SnNTT3 as a nucleotide triphosphate antiporter. In addition, SnNTT3 is able to transport dCTP, which has not been shown for a prokaryotic transport protein before. No substrate could be identified for SnNTT4. Taking these data together, S. negevensis employs a set of nucleotide transport proteins to efficiently tap its host's energy and nucleotide pools. Although similar to other chlamydiae, these transporters show distinct and unique adaptations with respect to substrate specificities and mode of transport.

19667393|t|Methanoregula formicica sp. nov., a methane-producing archaeon isolated from methanogenic sludge.
19667393|a|A novel methane-producing archaeon, strain SMSP(T), was isolated from an anaerobic, propionate-degrading enrichment culture that was originally obtained from granular sludge in a mesophilic upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor used to treat a beer brewery effluent. Cells were non-motile, blunt-ended, straight rods, 1.0-2.6 mum long by 0.5 mum wide; cells were sometimes up to 7 mum long. Asymmetrical cell division was observed in rod-shaped cells. Coccoid cells (0.5-1.0 mum in diameter) were also observed in mid- to late-exponential phase cultures. Growth was observed between 10 and 40 ^0C (optimum, 30-33 ^0C) and pH 7.0 and 7.6 (optimum, pH 7.4). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.2 mol%. The strain utilized formate and hydrogen for growth and methane production. Based on comparative sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA and mcrA (encoding the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, a key enzyme in the methane-producing pathway) genes, strain SMSP(T) was affiliated with group E1/E2 within the order Methanomicrobiales. The closest relative based on both 16S rRNA and mcrA gene sequences was Methanoregula boonei 6A8(T) (96.3 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 85.4 % deduced McrA amino acid sequence similarity). The percentage of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity indicates that strain SMSP(T) and Methanoregula boonei 6A8(T) represent different species within the same genus. This is supported by our findings of shared phenotypic properties, including cell morphology and growth temperature range, and phenotypic differences in substrate usage and pH range. Based on these genetic and phenotypic properties, we propose that strain SMSP(T) represents a novel species of the genus Methanoregula, for which we propose the name Methanoregula formicica sp. nov., with the type strain SMSP(T) (=NBRC 105244(T) =DSM 22288(T)).

21377422|t|Compartmentalization of a glycolytic enzyme in Diplonema, a non-kinetoplastid euglenozoan.
21377422|a|Glycosomes are peroxisome-related organelles containing glycolytic enzymes that have been found only in kinetoplastids. We show here that a glycolytic enzyme is compartmentalized in diplonemids, the sister group of kinetoplastids. We found that, similar to kinetoplastid aldolases, the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase of Diplonema papillatum possesses a type 2-peroxisomal targeting signal. Western blotting showed that this aldolase was present predominantly in the membrane/organellar fraction. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that this aldolase had a scattered distribution in the cytosol, suggesting its compartmentalization. In contrast, orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase, a non-glycolytic glycosomal enzyme in kinetoplastids, was shown to be a cytosolic enzyme in D. papillatum. Since euglenoids, the earliest diverging branch of Euglenozoa, do not possess glycolytic compartments, these findings suggest that the routing of glycolytic enzymes into peroxisomes may have occurred in a common ancestor of diplonemids and kinetoplastids, followed by diversification of these newly established organelles in each of these euglenozoan lineages.

21029117|t|Dynamic changes of canopy-scale mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion of flower as affected by CO2 concentration and abscisic acid.
21029117|a|Leaf-level measurements have shown that mesophyll conductance (g(m)) can vary rapidly in response to CO2 and other environmental factors, but similar studies at the canopy-scale are missing. Here, we report the effect of short-term variation of CO2 concentration on canopy-scale g(m) and other CO2 exchange parameters of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) stands in the presence and absence of abscisic acid (ABA) in their nutrient solution. g(m) was estimated from gas exchange and on-line carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(obs)) in a ^1^3CO2/^1^2CO2) gas exchange mesocosm. The isotopic contribution of (photo)respiration to stand-scale Delta(obs) was determined with the experimental approach of Tcherkez et al. Without ABA, short-term exposures to different CO2 concentrations (C(a) 100 to 900 mumol mol-^1) had little effect on canopy-scale g(m) . But, addition of ABA strongly altered the CO2-response: g(m) was high (approx. 0.5 mol CO2 m-^2 s-^1) at C(a) &lt;200 mumol mol-^1 and decreased to &lt;0.1 mol CO2 m-^2 s-^1 at C(a) >400 mumol mol-^1. In the absence of ABA, the contribution of (photo)respiration to stand-scale Delta(obs) was high at low C(a) (7.2 %) and decreased to &lt;2 % at C(a) > 400 mumol mol-^1. Treatment with ABA halved this effect at all C(a) .

20980497|t|A vaccinia virus deletion mutant reveals the presence of additional inhibitors of NF-kappaB.
20980497|a|The classical nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway is an important regulator of inflammation and innate immunity that is activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including virus infection, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 1Beta (IL-1Beta). Poxviruses, including vaccinia virus (VV) and ectromelia virus, encode multiple proteins that function in immune evasion. Recently, a growing number of genes encoded by poxviruses have been shown to target and disrupt the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. To determine if additional gene products that interfere with NF-kappaB signaling existed, we used a vaccinia virus deletion mutant, VV811, which is missing 55 open reading frames lacking all known inhibitors of TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation. Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells treated with TNF-alpha and IL-1Beta revealed that NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus was inhibited in VV811-infected cells. This was further confirmed through Western blotting of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts for NF-kappaB. Additionally, VV811 infection inhibited TNF-alpha-induced IkappaBalpha degradation. In contrast to vaccinia virus strain Copenhagen (VVCop)-infected cells, VV811 infection resulted in the dramatic accumulation of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha. Correspondingly, coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the NF-kappaB-inhibitory IkappaBalpha-p65-p50 complex was intact in VV811-infected cells. Significantly, cells treated with 1-Beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, an inhibitor of poxvirus late gene expression, demonstrated that an additional vaccinia virus late gene was involved in the stabilization of IkappaBalpha. Overall, this work indicates that unidentified inhibitors of NF-kappaB exist in vaccinia virus. The complex inhibition of NF-kappaB by vaccinia virus illustrates the importance of NF-kappaB activation in the antiviral response.

21148729|t|Mapping functional domains of colicin M.
21148729|a|Colicin M (Cma) lyses Escherichia coli cells by inhibiting murein biosynthesis through hydrolysis of the phosphate ester between C(55)-polyisoprenol and N-acetylmuramyl (MurNAc)-pentapeptide-GlcNAc in the periplasm. To identify Cma functional domains, we isolated 54 point mutants and small deletion mutants and examined their cytotoxicity levels. Activity and uptake mutants were distinguished by osmotic shock, which transfers Cma into the periplasm independent of the specific FhuA receptor and the Ton system. Deletion of the hydrophobic helix alpha1, which extends from the compact Cma structure, abolished interference with the antibiotic albomycin, which is transported across the outer membrane by the same system as Cma, thereby identifying alpha1 as the Cma site that binds to FhuA. Deletion of the C-terminal Lys-Arg strongly reduced Cma translocation across the outer membrane after binding to FhuA. Conversion of Asp226 to Glu, Asn, or Ala inactivated Cma. Asp226 is exposed at the Cma surface and is surrounded by Asp225, Asp229, His235, Tyr228, and Arg236; replacement of each with alanine inactivated Cma. We propose that Asp226 directly participates in phosphate ester hydrolysis and that the surrounding residues contribute to the active site. These residues are strongly conserved in Cma-like proteins of other species. Replacement of other conserved residues with alanine inactivated Cma; these mutations probably altered the Cma structure, as particularly apparent for mutants in the unique open Beta-barrel of Cma, which were isolated in lower yields. Our results identify regions in Cma responsible for uptake and activity and support the concept of a three-domain arrangement of Cma.

21354373|t|International Cognition and Cancer Task Force recommendations to harmonise studies of cognitive function in patients with cancer.
21354373|a|It has become increasingly apparent that cytotoxic drugs given systemically for non-CNS tumours might have cognitive side-effects, but many fundamental questions require further elucidation, and large samples from several institutions are needed. Two working groups brought together by the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force (ICCTF) developed recommendations for a core set of neuropsychological tests, common criterion for defining cognitive impairment and cognitive changes, and common approaches to improve the homogeneity of study methods. These recommendations will improve research design and facilitate study combinations, between-study comparisons, and meta-analyses, which will allow more accurate estimates of incidence, severity, individual risk factors, and causes of cognitive problems associated with chemotherapy for non-CNS tumours.

21453873|t|Visceral leishmaniasis: elimination with existing interventions.
21453873|a|The world's burden of infectious diseases can be substantially reduced by more-effective use of existing interventions. Advances in case detection, diagnosis, and treatment strategies have made it possible to consider the elimination of visceral leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent. The priority must now be to effectively implement existing interventions at the community level by actively finding cases in endemic villages and treating them with single-dose liposomal amphotericin B at primary-health-care centres. Once the elimination target of one case per 10,000 population has been reached, combination therapies involving miltefosine and paromomycin can be introduced to ensure long-term availability of several drugs for visceral leishmaniasis and to protect against resistance.

21526927|t|Wolbachia wSinvictaA infections in natural populations of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta: testing for phenotypic effects.
21526927|a|Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria that commonly infect many arthropods and some nematodes. In arthropods, these maternally transmitted bacteria often induce a variety of phenotypic effects to enhance their own spread within host populations. Wolbachia phenotypic effects generally either provide benefits to infected host females (cytoplasmic incompatibility, positive fitness effects) or bias host sex ratio in favor of females (male-killing, parthenogenesis, feminization), all of which increase the relative production of infected females in host populations. Wolbachia surveys have found infections to be exceedingly common in ants, but little is known at this juncture as to what phenotypic effects, if any, they induce in this group. Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals from native populations of the invasive fire ant Solenopsis invicta commonly harbor one or more of three Wolbachia variants. One of the variants, wSinvictaA, typically occurs at low prevalence in S. invicta populations, appears to have been transmitted horizontally into S. invicta three or more times, and has been lost repeatedly from host lineages over time. In order to determine the phenotypic effects and likely population dynamics of wSinvictaA infections in these ants, brood production patterns of newly mated fire ant queens were studied during simulated claustral founding and measured wSinvictaA transmission fidelity within mature single-queen families. No clear evidence was found for Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility, significant fitness effects, or male-killing. Maternal transmission was perfect to both virgin queens and males. Possible mechanisms for how this variant could be maintained in host populations are discussed.

21147038|t|Disrupted energy metabolism and neuronal circuit dysfunction in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
21147038|a|Epidemiological, neuropathological, and functional neuroimaging evidence implicates global and regional disruptions in brain metabolism and energetics in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Nerve cell microcircuits are modified by excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity and neurotrophic factors. Ageing and Alzheimer's disease cause perturbations in cellular energy metabolism, level of excitation or inhibition, and neurotrophic factor release, which overwhelm compensatory mechanisms and result in dysfunction of neuronal microcircuits and brain networks. A prolonged positive energy balance impairs the ability of neurons to adapt to oxidative and metabolic stress. Results from experimental studies in animals show how disruptions caused by chronic positive energy balance, such as diabetes, lead to accelerated cognitive ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic interventions to allay cognitive dysfunction that target energy metabolism and adaptive stress responses (such as neurotrophin signalling) have been effective in animal models and in preliminary studies in humans.

21115657|t|The three vibrio cholerae chromosome II-encoded ParE toxins degrade chromosome I following loss of chromosome II.
21115657|a|Three homologues of the plasmid RK2 ParDE toxin-antitoxin system are present in the Vibrio cholerae genome within the superintegron on chromosome II. Here we found that these three loci-two of which have identical open reading frames and regulatory sequences-encode functional toxin-antitoxin systems. The ParE toxins inhibit bacterial division and reduce viability, presumably due to their capacity to damage DNA. The in vivo effects of ParE1/3 mimic those of ParE2, which we have previously demonstrated to be a DNA gyrase inhibitor in vitro, suggesting that ParE1/3 is likewise a gyrase inhibitor, despite its relatively low degree of sequence identity. ParE-mediated DNA damage activates the V. cholerae SOS response, which in turn likely accounts for ParE's inhibition of cell division. Each toxin's effects can be prevented by the expression of its cognate ParD antitoxin, which acts in a toxin-specific fashion both to block toxicity and to repress the expression of its parDE operon. Derepression of ParE activity in DeltaparAB2 mutant V. cholerae cells that have lost chromosome II contributes to the prominent DNA degradation that accompanies the death of these cells. Overall, our findings suggest that the ParE toxins lead to the postsegregational killing of cells missing chromosome II in a manner that closely mimics postsegregational killing mediated by plasmid-encoded homologs. Thus, the parDE loci aid in the maintenance of the integrity of the V. cholerae superintegron and in ensuring the inheritance of chromosome II.

21371657|t|Population biological principles of drug-resistance evolution in infectious diseases.
21371657|a|The emergence of resistant pathogens in response to selection pressure by drugs and their possible disappearance when drug use is discontinued are evolutionary processes common to many pathogens. Population biological models have been used to study the dynamics of resistance in viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic microparasites both at the level of the individual treated host and of the treated host population. Despite the existence of generic features that underlie such evolutionary dynamics, different conclusions have been reached about the key factors affecting the rate of resistance evolution and how to best use drugs to minimise the risk of generating high levels of resistance. Improved understanding of generic versus specific population biological aspects will help to translate results between different studies, and allow development of a more rational basis for sustainable drug use than exists at present.

22182620|t|Influence of Sticky Trap Color and Height Above Ground on Capture of Alate Elatobium abietinum (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in Sitka Spruce Plantations.
22182620|a|A series of field trials were used to assess the practicality of using sticky traps to monitor populations of green spruce aphid, Elatobium abietinum (Walker), in plantations of Sitka spruce. The highest numbers of alate E. abietinum were caught on sticky traps placed in the upper third of the live canopy at 9-17 m above the ground, whereas low numbers of aphids were caught just below the live canopy or at 2 m above the ground. Trials in 2005 with sticky traps of different colors showed that significantly more alate E. abietinum were caught on yellow, red, and green sticky traps than on white, blue, and black traps. A repeat trial in 2007 resulted in significantly more alate aphids being caught on red sticky traps than on traps of any other color except for green. Attraction to red is unusual among aphids, as aphids are thought not to possess a red-sensitive photoreceptor. The attraction of E. abietinum to red-colored sticky traps suggests that conifer-feeding aphids might have a fundamentally different color response compared with aphids that live on cereals, grasses, or herbaceous plants. Alternatively, the attraction to red might be a physiological artifact related to the presence of red-screening pigments in the aphid's compound eye.

20580606|t|Treatment non-adherence in teenage and young adult patients with cancer.
20580606|a|Adhering to treatment can be a significant issue for many patients diagnosed with chronic health conditions and this has been reported to be greater during the adolescent years. However, little is known about treatment adherence in teenage and young adult (TYA) patients with cancer. To increase awareness of the adherence challenges faced by these patients, we have reviewed the published work. The available evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of TYA patients with cancer do have difficulties, with reports that up to 63% of patients do not adhere to their treatment regimens. However, with inconsistent findings across studies, the true extent of non-adherence for these young patients is still unclear. Furthermore, it is apparent that there are many components of the cancer treatment regimen that have yet to be assessed in relation to patient adherence. Factors that have been shown to affect treatment adherence in TYA patients include patient emotional functioning (depression and self-esteem), patient health beliefs (perceived illness severity and vulnerability), and family environment (parental support and parent-child concordance). Strategies that foster greater patient adherence are also identified. These strategies are multifactorial, targeting not only the patient, but the health professional, family, and treatment regimen. This review highlights the lack of interventional studies addressing treatment adherence in TYA patients with cancer, with only one such intervention being identified: a video game intervention focusing on behavioural issues related to cancer treatment and care. Methodological issues in measuring adherence are addressed and suggestions for improving the design of future adherence studies highlighted, of which there is a great need.

21256454|t|Treatment of patients with essential tremor.
21256454|a|Essential tremor is a common movement disorder. Tremor severity and handicap vary widely, but most patients with essential tremor do not receive a diagnosis and hence are never treated. Furthermore, many patients abandon treatment because of side-effects or poor efficacy. A newly developed algorithm, based on the logarithmic relation between tremor amplitude and clinical tremor ratings, can be used to compare the magnitude of effect of available treatments. Drugs with established efficacy (propranolol and primidone) produce a mean tremor reduction of about 50%. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the thalamic nucleus ventrointermedius or neighbouring subthalamic structures reduces tremor by about 90%. However, no controlled trials of DBS have been done, and the best target is still uncertain. Better drugs are needed, and controlled trials are required to determine the safety and efficacy of DBS in the nucleus ventrointermedius and neighbouring subthalamic structures.

21521141|t|First description of the early stage biology of the genus Mygona: the natural history of the satyrine butterfly, Mygona irmina in eastern Ecuador.
21521141|a|The immature stages and natural history of Mygona irmina Doubleday (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Satyrinae: Pronophilina) from northeastern Ecuadorian cloud forests are described based on 17 rearings. The dwarf bamboo, Chusquea c.f. scandens Kunth (Poaceae, Bambusoidea) is the larval food plant. Eggs are laid singly on the bottom side of mature host plant leaves. Larvae take 102-109 days to mature from egg to adult. Adults are encountered most frequently on sunny days, flying rapidly over areas dominated by their food plant or feeding on the ground at mammal feces. Males are often encountered inside large forest gaps near patches of bamboo guarding perches in the mid-canopy.

20708435|t|Barcoding Tetrahymena: discriminating species and identifying unknowns using the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox-1) barcode.
20708435|a|DNA barcoding using the mitochondrial cytochromecoxidase subunit I (cox-1) gene has recently gained popularity as a tool for species identification of a variety of taxa. The primary objective of our research was to explore the efficacy of using cox-1 barcoding for species identification within the genus Tetrahymena. We first increased intraspecific sampling for Tetrahymena canadensis, Tetrahymena hegewischi, Tetrahymena pyriformis, Tetrahymena rostrata, Tetrahymena thermophila, and Tetrahymena tropicalis. Increased sampling efforts show that intraspecific sequence divergence is typically less than 1%, though it may be more in some species. The barcoding also showed that some strains might be misidentified or mislabeled. We also used cox-1 barcodes to provide species identifications for 51 unidentified environmental isolates, with a success rate of 98%. Thus, cox-1 barcoding is an invaluable tool for protistologists, especially when used in conjunction with morphological studies.

21115655|t|Citrate uptake in exchange with intermediates in the citrate metabolic pathway in Lactococcus lactis IL1403.
21115655|a|Carbohydrate/citrate cometabolism in Lactococcus lactis results in the formation of the flavor compound acetoin. Resting cells of strain IL1403(pFL3) rapidly consumed citrate while producing acetoin when substoichiometric concentrations of glucose or l-lactate were present. A proton motive force was generated by electrogenic exchange of citrate and lactate catalyzed by the citrate transporter CitP and proton consumption in decarboxylation reactions in the pathway. In the absence of glucose or l-lactate, citrate consumption was biphasic. During the first phase, hardly any citrate was consumed. In the second phase, citrate was converted rapidly, but without the formation of acetoin. Instead, significant amounts of the intermediates pyruvate and alpha-acetolactate, and the end product acetate, were excreted from the cells. It is shown that the intermediates and acetate are excreted in exchange with the uptake of citrate catalyzed by CitP. The availability of exchangeable substrates in the cytoplasm determines both the rate of citrate consumption and the end product profile. It follows that citrate metabolism in L. lactis IL1403(pFL3) splits up in two routes after the formation of pyruvate, one the well-characterized route yielding acetoin and the other a new route yielding acetate. The flux distribution between the two branches changes from 85:15 in the presence of l-lactate to 30:70 in the presence of pyruvate. The proton motive force generated was greatest in the presence of l-lactate and zero in the presence of pyruvate, suggesting that the pathway to acetate does not generate proton motive force.

21276719|t|Protist-like inclusions in amber, as evidenced by Charentes amber.
21276719|a|The mid-Cretaceous amber of France contains thousands of protist-like inclusions similar in shape to some ciliates, flagellates and amoebae. The sheer abundance of these inclusions and their size variation within a single amber piece are not concordant with true fossil protists. French amber is coniferous in origin, which generally does not preserve well protists without cell walls. Thus, it would be surprising if French Cretaceous amber had preserved millions of protists. Here, we present a survey of the protist-like inclusions from French amber and attempt to elucidate their origins. Diverse Cretaceous ambers (from Spain, Germany and Lebanon), also derived from conifer resins, contain thousands of protist-like inclusions. In contrast, Tertiary ambers and modern resins are poor in protist-like fossils. This suggests these inclusions originated from early Cretaceous plant resins, probably secreted with the resin by trees that did not survive after the Cretaceous (such as the Cheirolepidiaceae). A review of the recent literature on amber microfossils indicates several protist-like inclusions that are unlikely to have a biological origin have already been described as real fossil protists. This is problematic in that it will bias our understanding of protist evolution.

21497131|t|Complete sructure of nuclear rDNA of the obligate plant parasite Plasmodiophora brassicae: intraspecific polymorphisms in the exon and group I intron of the large subunit rDNA.
21497131|a|Plasmodiophora brassicae is a soil-borne obligate intracellular parasite in the phylum Cercozoa of the Rhizaria that causes clubroot disease of crucifer crops. To control the disease, understanding the distribution and infection routes of the pathogen is essential, and thus development of reliable molecular markers to discriminate geographic populations is required. In this study, the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) repeat unit of P. brassicae was determined, with particular emphasis on the structure of large subunit (LSU) rDNA, in which polymorphic regions were expected to be present. The complete rDNA complex was 9513bp long, which included the small subunit, 5.8S and LSU rDNAs as well as the internal transcribed spacer and intergenic spacer regions. Among eight field populations collected from throughout Honshu Island, Japan, a 1.1 kbp region of the LSU rDNA, including the divergent 8 domain, exhibited intraspecific polymorphisms that reflected geographic isolation of the populations. Two new group I introns were found in this region in six out of the eight populations, and the sequences also reflected their geographic isolation. The polymorphic region found in this study may have potential for the development of molecular markers for discrimination of field populations/isolates of this organism.

21349440|t|Neuroinflammation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: role of glial activation in motor neuron disease.
21349440|a|Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are characterised by the appearance of reactive microglial and astroglial cells, a process referred to as neuroinflammation. In transgenic mouse models of mutant SOD1-associated familial ALS, reactive microglial cells and astrocytes actively contribute to the death of motor neurons. The biological processes that drive this glial reaction are complex and have both beneficial and deleterious effects on motor neurons. Therapeutic interventions targeting these cells are being explored. An improved understanding of the biological processes that cause neuroinflammation will help to define its medical importance and to identify the therapeutic potential of interfering with this reaction.

21398102|t|Genetic diversity and phylogenetic position of the subclass Astomatia (Ciliophora) based on a sampling of six genera from West African oligochaetes (Glossoscolecidae, Megascolecidae), including description of the new genus Paraclausilocola n. gen.
21398102|a|To more confidently assess phylogenetic relationships among astome ciliates, we obtained small subunit (SSU) rRNA sequences from nine species distributed in six genera and three families: Almophrya bivacuolata, Eudrilophrya complanata, Metaracoelophrya sp. 1, Metaracoelophrya sp. 2, Metaracoelophrya intermedia, Metaradiophrya sp., Njinella prolifera, Paraclausilocola constricta n. gen., n. sp., and Paraclausilocola elongata n. sp. The two new species in the proposed new clausilocolid genus Paraclausilocola n. gen. are astomes with no attachment apparatus, two files of contractile vacuoles, and an arc-like anterior suture that has differentiations of thigmotactic ciliature on the anterior ends of the left kineties of the upper surface. Phylogenetic analyses were undertaken using neighbor-joining, Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony. The nine species of astomes formed a strongly supported clade, showing the subclass Astomatia to be monophyletic and a weakly supported sister clade to the scuticociliates. There were two strongly supported clades within the astomes. However, genera assigned to the same family were found in different clades, and genera assigned to the same order were found in both clades. Thus, astome taxa appear to be paraphyletic when morphology is used to assign species to genera.

21296615|t|Definition and classification of cancer cachexia: an international consensus.
21296615|a|To develop a framework for the definition and classification of cancer cachexia a panel of experts participated in a formal consensus process, including focus groups and two Delphi rounds. Cancer cachexia was defined as a multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment. Its pathophysiology is characterised by a negative protein and energy balance driven by a variable combination of reduced food intake and abnormal metabolism. The agreed diagnostic criterion for cachexia was weight loss greater than 5%, or weight loss greater than 2% in individuals already showing depletion according to current bodyweight and height (body-mass index [BMI] &lt;20 kg/m(2)) or skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia). An agreement was made that the cachexia syndrome can develop progressively through various stages--precachexia to cachexia to refractory cachexia. Severity can be classified according to degree of depletion of energy stores and body protein (BMI) in combination with degree of ongoing weight loss. Assessment for classification and clinical management should include the following domains: anorexia or reduced food intake, catabolic drive, muscle mass and strength, functional and psychosocial impairment. Consensus exists on a framework for the definition and classification of cancer cachexia. After validation, this should aid clinical trial design, development of practice guidelines, and, eventually, routine clinical management.

21338353|t|Intentional genetic introgression influences survival of adults and subadults in a small, inbred felid population.
21338353|a|1. Inbreeding and low genetic diversity can cause reductions in individual fitness and increase extinction risk in animal populations. Intentional introgression, achieved by releasing genetically diverse individuals into inbred populations, has been used as a conservation tool to improve demographic performance in endangered populations. 2. By the 1980s, Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) had been reduced to a small, inbred population that appeared to be on the brink of extinction. In 1995, female pumas from Texas (P. c. stanleyana) were released in occupied panther range as part of an intentional introgression programme to restore genetic variability and improve demographic performance of panthers. 3. We used 25 years (1981-2006) of continuous radiotelemetry and genetic data to estimate and model subadult and adult panther survival and cause-specific mortality to provide rigorous sex and age class-specific survival estimates and evaluate the effect of the introgression programme on these parameters. 4. Genetic ancestry influenced annual survival of subadults and adults after introgression, as F(1) generation admixed panthers ( = 0*98) survived better than pre-introgression type panthers ( = 0*77) and other admixed individuals ( = 0*82). Furthermore, heterozygosity was higher for admixed panthers relative to pre-introgression type panthers and positively influenced survival. 5. Our results are consistent with hybrid vigour; however, extrinsic factors such as low density of males in some areas of panther range may also have contributed to higher survival of F(1) panthers. Regardless, improved survival of F(1) subadults and adults likely contributed to the numerical increase in panthers following introgression, and our results indicate that intentional admixture, achieved here by releasing individuals from another population, appears to have been successful in improving demographic performance in this highly endangered population.

21034776|t|A versatile vector for the production of pseudotyped viruses expressing gp120 antigens from different clades of primary HIV-1 isolates.
21034776|a|A novel HIV-1 Env expression vector (SF162-Z) was developed by introducing two new cloning sites on the backbone of an existing vector that produces a full length Env from HIV-1 SF162 isolate. These sites facilitate the swapping of the gp120 portion of the SF162 Env with matching gp120 antigens from HIV-1 isolates of different genetic clades. Final production of functional pseudotyped viruses will express chimeric Env antigens, including gp41 of the parental SF162 and gp120 from other primary isolates. This system is useful for testing the neutralizing sensitivity of partial env gene products frequently identified in viral quasi species in patients infected with HIV or when only partial gp120 gene products are available.

20946532|t|Functional characterization of pheromone receptors in the tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens.
20946532|a|Functional analyses of candidate Heliothis virescens pheromone odorant receptors (HvORs) were conducted using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. HvOR6 was found to be highly tuned to Z9-14:Ald, while HvOR13, HvOR14 and HvOR16 showed specificity for Z11-16:Ald, Z11-16:OAc and Z11-16:OH, respectively. HvOR15, which had been considered a candidate receptor for Z9-14:Ald did not respond to any of the pheromone compounds tested, nor to 50 other general odorants. Thus, while HvOR15 is specifically expressed in H. virescens male antennae, its role in pheromone reception remains unknown. Based on our results and previous research we can now assign pheromone receptors in H. virescens males to each of the critical H. virescens agonistic pheromone compounds and two antagonistic compounds produced by heterospecific females.

21511199|t|Stroke and the immune system: from pathophysiology to new therapeutic strategies.
21511199|a|Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide and a major cause of acquired disability in adults. Despite tremendous progress in understanding the pathophysiology of stroke, translation of this knowledge into effective therapies has largely failed, with the exception of thrombolysis, which only benefits a small proportion of patients. Systemic and local immune responses have important roles in causing stroke and are implicated in the primary and secondary progression of ischaemic lesions, as well as in repair, recovery, and overall outcome after a stroke. However, potential therapeutic targets in the immune system and inflammatory responses have not been well characterised. Development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies for stroke will require further investigation of these pathways in terms of their temporal profile (before, during, and after stroke) and risk-to-benefit therapeutic ratio of modulating them.

20884290|t|The novel marine gliding zooflagellate genus Mantamonas (Mantamonadida ord. n.: Apusozoa).
20884290|a|Mantamonas is a novel genus of marine gliding zooflagellates probably related to apusomonad and planomonad Apusozoa. Using phase and differential interference contrast microscopy we describe the type species Mantamonas plastica sp. n. from coastal sediment in Cumbria, England. Cells are -5mum long, -5mum wide, asymmetric, flattened, biciliate, and somewhat plastic. The posterior cilium, on which they glide smoothly over the substratum, is long and highly acronematic. The much thinner, shorter, and almost immobile anterior cilium points forward to the cell's left. These morphological and behavioural traits suggest that Mantamonas is a member of the protozoan phylum Apusozoa. Analyses of 18S and 28S rRNA gene sequences of Mantamonas plastica and a second genetically very different marine species from coastal sediment in Tanzania show Mantamonas as a robustly monophyletic clade, that is very divergent from all other eukaryotes. 18S rRNA trees mostly place Mantamonas within unikonts (opisthokonts, Apusozoa, and Amoebozoa) but its precise position varies with phylogenetic algorithm and/or taxon and nucleotide position sampling; it may group equally weakly as sister to Planomonadida, Apusomonadida or Breviata. On 28S rRNA and joint 18/28S rRNA phylogenies (including 11 other newly obtained apusozoan/amoebozoan 28S rRNA sequences) it consistently strongly groups with Apusomonadida (Apusozoa).

20650683|t|Stress-induced pseudocyst formation--a newly identified mechanism of protection against organic solvents in acanthamoebae of the T4 genotype.
20650683|a|Differentiation into highly resistant double-walled cysts is a major mechanism allowing amphizoic acanthamoebae to survive under long-lasting, unfavourable environmental conditions. We found that relatively low concentrations of methanol, acetone or DMSO stimulate prompt Acanthamoeba differentiation into a rounded cyst-like stage with a single envelope. To address whether this rapid response differs from the encystment, time-dependent changes in cell surface characteristics and cyst-specific gene expression were monitored in encystating cells and cells differentiating under methanol treatment using microscopic, lectin-binding, PCR and resistance studies. In contrast to the encystment: (1) a single-layered amorphous mannose/glucose coat was the only envelope assembled on the surface of the solvent-treated cells, (2) the cyst-specific protein (CSP21) was not expressed, (3) the coat did not protect cells against acidic pH and (4) in solvent-free encystment medium, the coated cells did not assemble the double-layered wall, thus indicating that these cells were not immature cysts. These findings lead us to specify a terminal stage of rapid Acanthamoeba differentiation elicited by acute organic solvent stress as &quot;pseudocyst&quot;, and to suggest that encystation and pseudocyst formation are distinct stress responses. Moreover, the possibility exists that pseudocysts might form in response to certain contact lens solutions thus increasing resistance of acanthamoebae to disinfecting agents.

21247806|t|Neurological complications of acute ischaemic stroke.
21247806|a|Complications after ischaemic stroke, including both neurological and medical complications, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Neurological complications, such as brain oedema or haemorrhagic transformation, occur earlier than do medical complications and can affect outcomes with potential serious short-term and long-term consequences. Some of these complications could be prevented or, when this is not possible, early detection and proper management could be effective in reducing the adverse effects. However, there is little evidence-based data to guide the management of these neurological complications. There is a clear need for improved surveillance and specific interventions for the prevention, early diagnosis, and proper management of neurological complications during the acute phase of stroke to reduce stroke morbidity and mortality.

21039561|t|Ecological trade-offs between jasmonic acid-dependent direct and indirect plant defences in tritrophic interactions.
21039561|a|Recent studies on plants genetically modified in jasmonic acid (JA) signalling support the hypothesis that the jasmonate family of oxylipins plays an important role in mediating direct and indirect plant defences. However, the interaction of two modes of defence in tritrophic systems is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the preference and performance of a herbivorous leafminer (Liriomyza huidobrensis) and its parasitic wasp (Opius dissitus) on three tomato genotypes: a wild-type (WT) plant, a JA biosynthesis (spr2) mutant, and a JA-overexpression 35S::prosys plant. Their proteinase inhibitor production and volatile emission were used as direct and indirect defence factors to evaluate the responses of leafminers and parasitoids. Here, we show that although spr2 mutant plants are compromised in direct defence against the larval leafminers and in attracting parasitoids, they are less attractive to adult flies compared with WT plants. Moreover, in comparison to other genotypes, the 35S::prosys plant displays greater direct and constitutive indirect defences, but reduced success of parasitism by parasitoids. Taken together, these results suggest that there are distinguished ecological trade-offs between JA-dependent direct and indirect defences in genetically modified plants whose fitness should be assessed in tritrophic systems and under natural conditions.

21272792|t|Effective management in clusters of pneumococcal disease: a systematic review.
21272792|a|Outbreaks of serious pneumococcal disease can occur with high attack rates in certain settings. We systematically reviewed studies of interventions implemented in pneumococcal clusters and those reporting the effect of antibiotics on carriage reduction to assess the effectiveness of interventions. Evidence was graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network system. Of 28 identified cluster reports, one showed that administration of antibiotics to close contacts reduced risk of pneumococcal disease. In three of four clusters where rifampicin chemoprophylaxis was used and in four of five clusters where penicillin was used no further cases were seen after intervention. In clusters where pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was used, subsequent cases occurred, all within around 2 weeks of vaccination, which suggests delayed benefit with this approach (evidence grade D). Use of infection control measures alone was reported in eight clusters, with no further cases being reported in seven (grade D). From 21 selected carriage studies, large carriage reductions were observed consistently with use of penicillin and azithromycin, with median values being 90% and 73%, respectively (grade C). The findings were presented to a working group for pneumococcal cluster guidelines and used to develop key recommendations on the management of clusters that supported prompt use of amoxicillin or azithromycin chemoprophylaxis, pneumococcal vaccination for close contacts, and implementation of infection control measures.

21251017|t|A bicistronic, Ubiquitin-10 promoter-based vector cassette for transient transformation and functional analysis of membrane transport demonstrates the utility of quantitative voltage clamp studies on intact Arabidopsis root epidermis.
21251017|a|To date the use of fluorescent reporter constructs in analysing membrane transport has been limited primarily to cell lines expressing stably either the tagged transporter protein(s) or markers to identify lineages of interest. Strategies for transient expression have yet to be exploited in transport analysis, despite their wide application in cellular imaging studies. Here we describe a Gateway-compatible, bicistronic vector, incorporating the constitutive Ubiqutin-10 gene promoter of Arabidopsis that gives prolonged expression after transient transformation and enables fluorescence marking of cells without a fusion construct. We show that Arabidopsis root epidermal cells are readily transformed by co-cultivation with Agrobacterium and are tractable for quantitative electrophysiological analysis. As a proof of principle, we transiently transformed Arabidopsis with the bicistronic vector carrying GFP as the fluorescent marker and, separately, the integral plasma membrane protein SYP121 essential for the inward K+ channel current. We demonstrate that transient expression of SYP121 in syp121 mutant plants is sufficient to rescue the K+ current in vivo. The combination of transient expression and use of the bicistronic vector promises significant advantages for studies of membrane transport and nutrient acquisition in roots.

21632222|t|Carnivorous planktonic Difflugia (Protista, Amoebina Testacea) and their predators.
21632222|a|Four planktonic species of Difflugia co-occurring in a south Chinese reservoir were found to be carnivorous, but the diet was widest in the largest species (D. tuberspinifera) and narrowest in the smallest (D. hydrostatica). It included rotifers, ciliates, dinoflagellates, floating eggs, and small particles associated with organic debris. Scavenging and cannibalism were also observed. Species with a collared test (D. biwae, D. mulanensis) showed a form of suction-feeding, while species with teeth on the pseudostome used these, together with their pseudopods, as &quot;inverted crown corks&quot;, providing leverage for opening the lorica of their (rotifer) prey. Predators of Difflugia included cyclopoid copepods. In addition, the rotifers Asplanchna priodonta, Ploesoma hudsoni and, occasionally, big ciliates (Stentor sp.) all ingested their prey as a whole.

21420357|t|The ultrastructure of Ancyromonas, a eukaryote without supergroup affinities.
21420357|a|The small heterotrophic flagellate Ancyromonas (=Planomonas) lacks close relatives in most molecular phylogenies, and it is suspected that it does not belong to any of the recognized eukaryote 'supergroups', making it an organism of great evolutionary interest. Proposed relatives include apusomonads and excavates, but limited understanding of the ancyromonad cytoskeleton has precluded identification of candidate structural homologies. We present a detailed analysis of the ultrastructure of Ancyromonas through computer-based reconstruction of serial sections. We confirm or extend previous observations of its major organelles (mitochondria, Golgi body, extrusomes, etc.) and pellicle, and distinguish a system of stacked endomembranes that may be developmentally connected to the glycocalyx. Ancyromonas has two basal bodies, each with its own flagellar pocket. The anterior basal body associates with two microtubular elements: a doublet root that runs from between the basal bodies to support the cell's rostrum, and a short singlet root. The posterior basal body is associated with two multi-microtubular structures and a singlet root. One multi-microtubular structure, L1, is a conventional microtubular root. The other structure appears as a curved ribbon of -8 microtubules near the basal body, but then flares out into two multi-microtubular elements, L2 and L3, plus two single microtubules. The posterior singlet root originates independently near this second complex. L1, the singlet, L2, and L3 all support the posterior flagellar pocket and channel. We also identified several groups of peripheral microtubules. Possible homologies with the flagellar apparatus of both apusomonads and excavates include a splitting root on the right side of the posterior basal body and a singlet root, both supporting a longitudinal channel or groove associated with the posterior flagellum. The anterior flagellar apparatus in each includes a root supporting structures to the left of the anterior flagellum. Given the probable deep divergences of Ancyromonas, apusomonads and excavates within eukaryotes, it is possible that the eukaryotic cenancestor also possessed these features.

20980503|t|Adenovirus membrane penetration activates the NLRP3 inflammasome.
20980503|a|Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) infection of macrophages results in rapid secretion of interleukin-1Beta (IL-1Beta) and is dependent on the inflammasome components NLRP3 and ASC and the catalytic activity of caspase-1. Using lentivirus-expressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and competitive inhibitors, we show that Ad-induced IL-1Beta release is dependent upon Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) sensing of the Ad5 double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome in human cell lines and primary monocyte-derived macrophages but not in mouse macrophages. Additionally, a temperature-sensitive mutant of Ad5 unable to penetrate endosomal membranes, ts1, is unable to induce IL-1Beta release in TLR2-primed THP-1 cells, suggesting that penetration of endosomal membranes is required for IL-1Beta release. Disruption of lysosomal membranes and the release of cathepsin B into the cytoplasm are required for Ad-induced NLRP3 activation. Ad5 cell entry also induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inhibitors of ROS prevent Ad-induced IL-1Beta release. Ad5 activation of NLRP3 also induces necrotic cell death, resulting in the release of the proinflammatory molecule HMGB1. This work further defines the mechanisms of virally induced inflammasome activation.

21388373|t|What determines variation in home range size across spatiotemporal scales in a large browsing herbivore?
21388373|a|1. Most studies of intraspecific variation in home range size have investigated only a single or a few factors and often at one specific scale. However, considering multiple spatial and temporal scales when defining a home range is important as mechanisms that affect variation in home range size may differ depending on the scale under investigation. 2. We aim to quantify the relative effect of various individual, forage and climatic determinants of variation in home range size across multiple spatiotemporal scales in a large browsing herbivore, the moose (Alces alces), living at the southern limit of its distribution in Norway. 3. Total home range size and core home range areas were estimated for daily to monthly scales in summer and winter using both local convex hull (LoCoH) and fixed kernel home range methods. Variance in home range size was analysed using linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements. 4. Reproductive status was the most influential individual-level factor explaining variance in moose home range size, with females accompanied by a calf having smaller summer ranges across all scales. Variation in home range size was strongly correlated with spatiotemporal changes in quantity and quality of natural food resources. Home range size decreased with increasing browse density at daily scales, but the relationship changed to positive at longer temporal scales. In contrast, browse quality was consistently negatively correlated with home range size except at the monthly scale during winter when depletion of high-quality forage occurs. Local climate affected total home range size more than core areas. Temperature, precipitation and snow depth influenced home range size directly at short temporal scales. 5. The relative effects of intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of variation in home range size differed with spatiotemporal scale, providing clear evidence that home range size is scale dependent in this large browser. Insight into the behavioural responses of populations to climatic stochasticity and forage variability is essential in view of current and future climate change, especially for populations with thermoregulatory restrictions living at the southern limit of their distribution.

21083871|t|Demographic consequences of adult sex ratio in a reintroduced hihi population.
21083871|a|1. Male-biased adult sex ratios are frequently observed in free-ranging populations and are known to cause changes in mating behaviours including increased male harassment of females, which can cause injury to females and/or alter female behaviour during breeding. 2. Although we can explain why such behaviours may evolve and have studied their impacts on individuals when it does, we know very little about the demographic consequences of harassment caused by changes in adult sex ratio. 3. Using a 12-year longitudinal data set of a free-living and endangered New Zealand passerine, the hihi (Notiomystis cincta), we show that a changing adult sex ratio has little or no effect on adult female survival or the number of fledglings produced per female. This is despite clear evidence of male harassment of breeding females when the sex ratio was male biased (up to three males per female). 4. The length of the study and major fluctuations in sex ratio observed made it possible to obtain narrow confidence or credible intervals for effect sizes, showing that any effect of sex ratio on demographic rates were small. 5. Our results provide rare empirical evidence for the demographic consequences of biased adult sex ratios in the wild and particularly in a conservation context.

21163702|t|The ribonucleotide reductase large subunit (RRM1) as a predictive factor in patients with cancer.
21163702|a|The large subunit of human ribonucleotide reductase, RRM1, is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell migration, tumour and metastasis development, and the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis. It is also a cellular target for the chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine. RRM1 has been studied in a large number of patients with different types of cancer, such as non-small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and biliary tract cancer, to establish its prognostic or predictive value when patients were treated with gemcitabine, and mRNA expression and genetic variants as determined by genotyping have in some cases been associated with clinical outcome of patients with cancer. Here, we review preclinical and clinical studies of RRM1 assessment and discuss the further steps in the development of this clinically pertinent biomarker.

20946588|t|Glycinebetaine protects plants against abiotic stress: mechanisms and biotechnological applications.
20946588|a|Various compatible solutes enable plants to tolerate abiotic stress, and glycinebetaine (GB) is one of the most-studied among such solutes. Early research on GB focused on the maintenance of cellular osmotic potential in plant cells. Subsequent genetically engineered synthesis of GB-biosynthetic enzymes and studies of transgenic plants demonstrated that accumulation of GB increases tolerance of plants to various abiotic stresses at all stages of their life cycle. Such GB-accumulating plants exhibit various advantageous traits, such as enlarged fruits and flowers and/or increased seed number under non-stress conditions. However, levels of GB in transgenic GB-accumulating plants are relatively low being, generally, in the millimolar range. Nonetheless, these low levels of GB confer considerable tolerance to various stresses, without necessarily contributing significantly to cellular osmotic potential. Moreover, low levels of GB, applied exogenously or generated by transgenes for GB biosynthesis, can induce the expression of certain stress-responsive genes, including those for enzymes that scavenge reactive oxygen species. Thus, transgenic approaches that increase tolerance to abiotic stress have enhanced our understanding of mechanisms that protect plants against such stress.

20980498|t|Template recognition mechanisms by replicase proteins differ between bipartite positive-strand genomic RNAs of a plant virus.
20980498|a|Recognition of RNA templates by viral replicase proteins is one of the key steps in the replication process of all RNA viruses. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, including primary RNA elements that are recognized by the viral replicase proteins, are not well understood. Here, we used aptamer pulldown assays with membrane fractionation and protein-RNA coimmunoprecipitation in a cell-free viral translation/replication system to investigate how viral replicase proteins recognize the bipartite genomic RNAs of the Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV). RCNMV replicase proteins bound specifically to a Y-shaped RNA element (YRE) located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of RNA2, which also interacted with the 480-kDa replicase complexes that contain viral and host proteins. The replicase-YRE interaction recruited RNA2 to the membrane fraction. Conversely, RNA1 fragments failed to interact with the replicase proteins supplied in trans. The results of protein-RNA coimmunoprecipitation assays suggest that RNA1 interacts with the replicase proteins coupled with their translation. Thus, the initial template recognition mechanisms employed by the replicase differ between RCNMV bipartite genomic RNAs and RNA elements are primary determinants of the differential replication mechanism.

21250991|t|Are numbers enough? Colonizer phenotype and abundance interact to affect population dynamics.
21250991|a|1. Ecologists have long recognized that the number of colonizers entering a population can be a major driver of population dynamics, but still struggle to explain why the importance of colonizer supply varies so dramatically. While there are indications that differences in the phenotype among dispersing individuals could also be important to populations, the role of phenotypic variation relative to the number of individuals, and the extent to which they interact, remains unknown. 2. We simultaneously manipulated the phenotype (dispersal duration) and abundance of settlers of a marine bryozoan and measured subsequent population structure in the field. 3. Increases in the number of colonizing individuals increased the subsequent recruitment and biomass of populations, regardless of colonizer phenotype. However, the relationship between colonizer abundance and the subsequent reproductive yield of the population was strongly reduced in populations containing individuals that had long dispersal durations. 4. The interactive effects of colonizer phenotype and abundance on the reproductive yield of populations occurred because longer dispersal durations decreased the proportion of individuals that reproduced. In fact, populations established from a few individuals with short dispersal durations had similar reproductive yield to populations c. 30 times larger established from individuals with long dispersal durations. 5. Interactions between colonizer phenotype and abundance have important implications for predicting population dynamics beyond those previously provided by numerical abundance or recruit phenotype alone.

20619737|t|Fertility-sparing surgery in patients with cervical cancer.
20619737|a|There are several types of fertility saving procedures that can be done in patients with cervical cancer, which differ in terms of surgical approach and extent of paracervical resection. This review assesses oncological and pregnancy results after different procedures. The oncological results of vaginal radical trachelectomies (VRT) and abdominal radical trachelectomies (ART) are similar for tumours less than 2 cm in size, and are now considered safe surgical procedures. Oncological outcomes of VRT and ART in tumours larger than 2 cm are also identical, but the results cannot be considered satisfactory. Preliminary findings of less radical procedures (ie, deep cone and simple trachelectomy) in patients with tumours less than 2 cm, and negative sentinel and other pelvic lymph nodes, are comparable with the results of VRT and ART. Downstaging tumours larger than 2 cm by neoadjuvant chemotherapy is still an experimental procedure and will need multicentre cooperation to verify its oncological safety. Pregnancy results vary statistically with the different methods.

21039557|t|Bud set in poplar--genetic dissection of a complex trait in natural and hybrid populations.
21039557|a|* The seasonal timing of growth events is crucial to tree distribution and conservation. The seasonal growth cycle is strongly adapted to the local climate that is changing because of global warming. We studied bud set as one cornerstone of the seasonal growth cycle in an integrative approach. * Bud set was dissected at the phenotypic level into several components, and phenotypic components with most genetic variation were identified. While phenotypic variation resided in the timing of growth cessation, and even so more in the duration from growth cessation to bud set, the timing of growth cessation had a stronger genetic component in both natural and hybrid populations. * Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for the most discriminative phenotypic bud-set components across four poplar pedigrees. The QTL from different pedigrees were recurrently detected in six regions of the poplar genome. * These regions of 1.83-4.25 Mbp in size, containing between 202 and 394 genes, form the basis for further molecular-genetic dissection of bud set.

22182610|t|Interactions Between Extrafloral Nectaries, Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and Other Natural Enemies Affect Biological Control of Grapholita molesta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) on Peach (Rosales: Rosaceae).
22182610|a|Extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are reported to benefit some plants when ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) use their secretions and fend off herbivores, but in some cases resulting competitive interactions may reduce biological control of specific herbivores. This research examined the interactions between ants and other natural enemies associated with the EFNs of peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batcsh] and the implications for biological control of a key pest, the oriental fruit moth [Grapholita molesta (Busck)]. Studies using sentinel G. molesta placed on peach trees ('Lovell' cultivar) with EFNs present and absent revealed that several natural enemy groups associated with the EFNs contribute to reductions in G. molesta eggs, larvae, and pupae in peach orchards. Ants on trees with EFNs antagonized the G. molesta egg parasitoid Trichogramma minutum (Riley), but the ants were crucial in reducing G. molesta in both the larval and pupal stages. Overall, individual trees with EFNs experienced higher ant and other (nonant) natural enemy densities and subsequent pest reductions, as compared with trees without EFNs. However, the implications of EFN-natural enemy-pest interactions to orchard-level biological control will likely depend on local G. molesta population dynamics.

21349439|t|Apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.
21349439|a|Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a 299-aminoacid protein encoded by the APOE gene. Three common polymorphisms in the APOE gene, epsilo2, epsilo3, and epsilo4, result in a single aminoacid change in the APOE protein. APOE epsilo2, epsilo3, and epsilo4 alleles strongly alter, in a dose-dependent manner, the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In particular, APOE epsilo4 is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease whereas APOE epsilo2 is associated with decreased risk. The effects of APOE genotype on risk of these diseases are likely to be mediated by differential effects of APOE on amyloid-Beta accumulation in the brain and its vasculature. Response to treatment for Alzheimer's disease might differ according to APOE genotype. Because convincing evidence ties the APOE genotype to risk of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, APOE has been studied in other neurological diseases. APOE epsilo4 is associated with poor outcome after traumatic brain injury and brain haemorrhage, although the mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear. The possibility that APOE has a role in these and other neurological diseases has been of great interest, but convincing associations have not yet emerged.

20980522|t|RNA aptamers directed to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag polyprotein bind to the matrix and nucleocapsid domains and inhibit virus production.
20980522|a|Gag orchestrates the assembly and release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles. We explored here the potential of anti-Gag RNA aptamers to inhibit HIV-1 replication. In vitro, RNA aptamers raised against an HIV-1 Gag protein, lacking the N-terminal myristate and the C-terminal p6 (DP6-Gag), could bind to matrix protein (MA), nucleocapsid protein (NC), or entire DP6-Gag protein. Upon cotransfection with pNL4-3.Luc molecular clone into 293T cells, six of the aptamers caused mild inhibition (2- to 3-fold) in the extracellular capsid levels, and one aptamer displayed 20-fold inhibition. The reduction was not due to a release defect but reflected Gag mRNA levels. We hypothesized that the aptamers influence genomic RNA levels via perturbation of specific Gag-genomic RNA interactions. Binding studies revealed that the &quot;NC-binders&quot; specifically compete with the packaging signal (psi) of HIV-1 for binding to DP6-Gag. Therefore, we tested the ability of two NC-binders to inhibit viruses containing psi-region deletions (DeltaSL1 or DeltaSL3) and found that the NC-binders were no longer able to inhibit Gag synthesis. The inability of these aptamers to inhibit psi-deleted viruses correlated with the absence of competition with the corresponding psi transcripts lacking SL1 or SL3 for binding DP6-Gag in vitro. These results indicate that the NC-binding aptamers disrupt Gag-genomic RNA interaction and negatively affect genomic RNA transcription, processing, or stability. Our results reveal an essential interaction between HIV-1 Gag and the psi-region that may be distinct from that which occurs during the encapsidation of genomic RNA. Thus, anti-Gag aptamers can be an effective tool to perturb Gag-genomic RNA interactions.

21807108|t|Fluorescent protein fusions in Candida guilliermondii.
21807108|a|Candida guilliermondii is an emerging fungal agent of candidiasis often associated with oncology patients. This yeast also remains a promising biotechnological model for the industrial production of value-added metabolites. In the present study, we developed a recipient strain as well as a set of plasmids for construction of fluorescent protein (FP) fusions in this species. We demonstrated that C. guilliermondii phosphoglycerate kinase transcription-regulating sequences allow a constitutive expression of codon-optimized green, cyan, yellow and mCherry FP genes in C. guilliermondii cells and the fluorescence signal could be directly observed at the colony and blastospore level by epifluorescence microcopy. To illustrate differential targeting of the FPs into specified cellular compartments, we studied and validated the expected subcellular localization of various C. guilliermondii predicted proteins fused to FPs. Furthermore, co-expression experiments of various couples of FP-tagged C. guilliermondii predicted proteins in the same cell showed that the fluorescence of each FP could be detected independently, providing firm evidences that YFP/CFP and GFP/mCherry pairs can be used for dual labeling in C. guilliermondii cells. This technical advance will facilitate future studies of protein co-expression and co-localization in C. guilliermondii and will give precious help for elucidating new molecular events supporting pathogenicity, antifungal resistance and for exploring the potential of yeast metabolic engineering.

20633690|t|UreA, the major urea/H+ symporter in Aspergillus nidulans.
20633690|a|We report here the characterization of UreA, a high-affinity urea/H+ symporter of Aspergillus nidulans. The deletion of the encoding gene abolishes urea transport at low substrate concentrations, suggesting that in these conditions UreA is the sole transport system specific for urea in A. nidulans. The ureA gene is not inducible by urea or its precursors, but responds to nitrogen metabolite repression, necessitating for its expression the AreA GATA factor. In contrast to what was observed for other transporters in A. nidulans, repression by ammonium is also operative during the isotropic growth phase. The activity of UreA is down-regulated post-translationally by ammonium-promoted endocytosis. A number of homologues of UreA have been identified in A. nidulans and other Aspergilli, which cluster in four groups, two of which contain the urea transporters characterized so far in fungi and plants. This phylogeny may have arisen by gene duplication events, giving place to putative transport proteins that could have acquired novel, still unidentified functions.

20831647|t|A hydraulic explanation for size-specific plant shrinkage: developmental hydraulic sectoriality.
20831647|a|* While great attention has been paid to the mechanisms controlling plant growth, much less is known about why and how plants shrink. The modular design of plants may facilitate the independence of modules if the xylem vasculature is hydraulically sectored. We examined the hydraulic connectivity of modules comprising juveniles and adults of the aridland chamaephyte Cryptantha flava (Boraginaceae), motivated by the observation that rosette mortality is spatially aggregated in adults, but not in juveniles. * We explored spatial patterns of leaf wilting after clipping a single lateral root, tracked physiological dyes taken up by a single root, and measured within-plant variation in leaf water potentials after watering a portion of the root system. We then measured xylem anatomical features related to hydraulic connectivity. * Our approaches revealed hydraulic integration in juveniles but hydraulic sectoriality in adults. We attribute such developmental changes to increasing distances between xylem bundles, and larger xylem lumen and heartwood areas as plants age. * We have demonstrated functional sectoriality in a desert chamaephyte, and report the mechanism by which sectoriality occurs, offering a hydraulic explanation for the death of whole plant portions resulting in shrinkage of large plants, and for the high occurrence of this design in deserts.

20943971|t|Roles of vaccinia virus genes E3L and K3L and host genes PKR and RNase L during intratracheal infection of C57BL/6 mice.
20943971|a|The importance of the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) pathways in host interferon induction resulting from virus infection in response to dsRNA has been well documented. In poxvirus infections, the interactions between the vaccinia virus (VV) genes E3L and K3L, which target RNase L and PKR, respectively, serve to prevent the induction of the dsRNA-dependent induced interferon response in cell culture. To determine the importance of these host genes in controlling VV infections, mouse single-gene knockouts of RNase L and PKR and double-knockout mice were studied following intratracheal infection with VV, VVDeltaK3L, or VVDeltaE3L. VV caused lethal disease in all mouse strains. The single-knockout animals were more susceptible than wild-type animals, while the RNase L(-/-) PKR(-/-) mice were the most susceptible. VVDeltaE3L infections of wild-type mice were asymptomatic, demonstrating that E3L plays a critical role in controlling the host immune response. RNase L(-/-) mice showed no disease, whereas 20% of the PKR(-/-) mice succumbed at a dose of 10(8) PFU. Lethal disease was routinely observed in RNase L(-/-) PKR(-/-) mice inoculated with 10(8) PFU of VVDeltaE3L, with a distinct pathology. VVDeltaK3L infections exhibited no differences in virulence among any of the mouse constructs, suggesting that PKR is not the exclusive target of K3L. Surprisingly, VVDeltaK3L did not disseminate to other tissues from the lung. Hence, the cause of death in this model is respiratory disease. These results also suggest that an unanticipated role of the K3L gene is to facilitate virus dissemination.

20961294|t|Isolation and characterization of MAT genes in the symbiotic ascomycete Tuber melanosporum.
20961294|a|* The genome of Tuber melanosporum has recently been sequenced. Here, we used this information to identify genes involved in the reproductive processes of this edible fungus. The sequenced strain (Mel28) possesses only one of the two master genes required for mating, that is, the gene that codes for the high mobility group (HMG) transcription factor (MAT1-2-1), whereas it lacks the gene that codes for the protein containing the alpha-box- domain (MAT1-1-1), suggesting that this fungus is heterothallic. * A PCR-based approach was initially employed to screen truffles for the presence of the MAT1-2-1 gene and amplify the conserved regions flanking the mating type (MAT) locus. The MAT1-1-1 gene was finally identified using primers designed from the conserved regions of strains that lack the MAT1-2-1 gene. * Mating type-specific primer pairs were developed to screen asci and gleba from truffles of different origins and to genotype single ascospores within the asci. These analyses provided definitive evidence that T. melanosporum is a heterothallic species with a MAT locus that is organized similarly to those of ancient fungal lineages. * A greater understanding of the reproductive mechanisms that exist in Tuber spp. allows for optimization of truffle plantation management strategies.

21084112|t|Ebola haemorrhagic fever.
21084112|a|Ebola viruses are the causative agents of a severe form of viral haemorrhagic fever in man, designated Ebola haemorrhagic fever, and are endemic in regions of central Africa. The exception is the species Reston Ebola virus, which has not been associated with human disease and is found in the Philippines. Ebola virus constitutes an important local public health threat in Africa, with a worldwide effect through imported infections and through the fear of misuse for biological terrorism. Ebola virus is thought to also have a detrimental effect on the great ape population in Africa. Case-fatality rates of the African species in man are as high as 90%, with no prophylaxis or treatment available. Ebola virus infections are characterised by immune suppression and a systemic inflammatory response that causes impairment of the vascular, coagulation, and immune systems, leading to multiorgan failure and shock, and thus, in some ways, resembling septic shock.

21035400|t|Energy metabolism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
21035400|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by the progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Besides motor neuron degeneration, ALS is associated with several defects in energy metabolism, including weight loss, hypermetabolism, and hyperlipidaemia. Most of these abnormalities correlate with duration of survival, and available clinical evidence supports a negative contribution of defective energy metabolism to the overall pathogenic process. Findings from animal models of ALS support this view and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms. Altogether, these results have clinical consequences for the management of defective energy metabolism in patients with ALS and pave the way for future therapeutic interventions.

20854481|t|Functional test of the influence of Wolbachia genes on cytoplasmic incompatibility expression in Drosophila melanogaster.
20854481|a|Wolbachia are inherited intracellular bacteria that infect a broad range of invertebrate hosts. They commonly manipulate host reproduction in a variety of ways and thereby favour their invasion into host populations. While the biology of Wolbachia has been extensively studied at the ecological and phenotypic level, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Wolbachia and their hosts. Recent comparative genomics studies of Wolbachia strains have revealed putative candidate genes involved in the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in insects. However the functional testing of these genes is hindered by the lack of available genetic tools in Wolbachia. To circumvent this problem we generated transgenic Drosophila lines expressing various Wolbachia CI candidate genes under the control of the GAL4/UAS system in order to evaluate their possible role in Wolbachia-related phenotypes in Drosophila. The expression of a number of these genes in Drosophila melanogaster failed to mimic or alter CI phenotypes across a range of Wolbachia backgrounds or in the absence of Wolbachia.

21112814|t|&quot;Slime molds&quot; among the Tubulinea (Amoebozoa): molecular systematics and taxonomy of Copromyxa.
21112814|a|Copromyxa protea is a dung-inhabiting amoeboid organism that aggregates to form simple macroscopic fruiting structures, sorocarps, which are composed of a single cell type. In a recent effort to find the phylogenetic positions of the less well-known sorocarpic protists considered to be &quot;cellular slime molds,&quot; or aggregatively fruiting amoebae, we isolated C. protea and sequenced the nuclear-encoded small subunit ribosomal RNA gene from four samples collected from cattle farms in the central USA. Phylogenetic analyses of these data place C. protea in the eukaryotic supergroup Amoebozoa together with the Tubulinea, in which there has been no previous report of an aggregative fruiting habit. This is consistent with the morphology of the trophozoites. In fact, Copromyxa protea is found to be very closely related to Hartmannella cantabrigiensis and to a since lost amoeba isolate, Hartmannella sp. 4/3Da/10. This new grouping of Copromyxa+H. cantabrigiensis is sister to Glaeseria, which together are sister to the Amoebidae (Amoeba+Chaos). We suggest renaming, H. cantabrigiensis as C. cantabrigiensis and designate isolate 4/3Da/10 as C. protea. Future work is needed to see if these newly assigned members of the genus Copromyxa also show evidence of an ability to fruit.

21371658|t|Guidelines for hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw.
21371658|a|The 2005 American Thoracic Society and Infectious Disease Society of America's guidelines for pneumonia introduced the new category of health-care-associated pneumonia, which increased the number of people to whom the guidelines for multidrug-resistant pathogens applied. Three fundamental issues inherent in the definition of hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia undermined the credibility of these guidelines and the applicability of their recommendations: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw. The vulnerability is the extreme heterogeneity of the population of patients. The fatal flaw is the failure to accurately diagnose hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia; inability to distinguish colonisation from infection in respiratory-tract cultures renders the guidelines inherently unstable. The pitfall is spiralling empiricism of antibiotic use for severely ill patients in whom infection might not be present. A vicious circle of antibiotic overuse leading to emergence of resistant microflora can become established, leading to unnecessary use of empirical broad-spectrum combination antibiotics and increased mortality. Controlled studies now show that administration of broad-spectrum combination antibiotic therapy can lead to increased mortality in uninfected patients. Proposed solutions include the use of individualised assessment of patients. Health-care-associated pneumonia should be broken down into several distinct subgroups so narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy can be used. Emphasis should be placed on defining the microbial cause of the pneumonia rather than reflex administration of empirical combination therapy.

20977508|t|DNA modifications and genome rearrangements during the development and sex differentiation of the bumble bee Bombus terrestris.
20977508|a|Bombus terrestris is a bumble bee that, like most hymenopteran species, exhibits ploidy-specific sex determination controlled by a single sex gene. Depending on their ploidy and the queen pheromone repression, the imagoes differentiate into three castes: males, workers and queens. Here, we focus on the differences of genome organization that occur during development and sex differentiation. We found that cytosine methylation is a significant epigenetic factor with profiles that can be correlated with both processes. We also showed that two kinds of genomic rearrangement occur. The first consists of important DNA amplifications that have sequence profiles that differ in the different developmental instars and sexes. In the second kind, DNA losses also occur, at least involving the mosaic transposable element B. terrestris mosaic repeat 1 (BTMR1).

21526933|t|Parasitism of lepidopterous stem borers in cultivated and natural habitats.
21526933|a|Plant infestation, stem borer density, parasitism, and parasitoid abundance were assessed during two years in two host plants, Zea mays (L.) (Cyperales: Poaceae) and Sorghum bicolor (L.) (Cyperales: Poaceae), in cultivated habitats. The four major host plants (Cyperus spp., Panicum spp., Pennisetum spp., and Sorghum spp.) found in natural habitats were also assessed, and both the cultivated and natural habitat species occurred in four agroecological zones in Kenya. Across habitats, plant infestation (23.2%), stem borer density (2.2 per plant), and larval parasitism (15.0%) were highest in maize in cultivated habitats. Pupal parasitism was not higher than 4.7% in both habitats, and did not vary with locality during each season or with host plant between each season. Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron) and C. flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) were the key parasitoids in cultivated habitats (both species accounted for 76.4% of parasitized stem borers in cereal crops), but not in natural habitats (the two Cotesia species accounted for 14.5% of parasitized stem borers in wild host plants). No single parasitoid species exerted high parasitism rates on stem borer populations in wild host plants. Low stem borer densities across seasons in natural habitats indicate that cereal stem borer pests do not necessarily survive the non-cropping season feeding actively in wild host plants. Although natural habitats provided refuges for some parasitoid species, stem borer parasitism was generally low in wild host plants. Overall, because parasitoids contribute little in reducing cereal stem borer pest populations in cultivated habitats, there is need to further enhance their effectiveness in the field to regulate these pests.

21148732|t|Functional and phylogenetic analysis of ureD in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli.
21148732|a|Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a food-borne pathogen that can cause severe health complications and utilizes a much lower infectious dose than other E. coli pathotypes. Despite having an intact ure locus, ureDABCEFG, the majority of EHEC strains are phenotypically urease negative under tested conditions. Urease activity potentially assists with survival fitness by enhancing acid tolerance during passage through the stomach or by aiding with colonization in either human or animal reservoirs. Previously, in the EHEC O157:H7 Sakai strain, a point mutation in ureD, encoding a urease chaperone protein, was identified, resulting in a substitution of an amber stop codon for glutamine. This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is observed in the majority of EHEC O157:H7 isolates and correlates with a negative urease phenotype in vitro. We demonstrate that the lack of urease activity in vitro is not solely due to the amber codon in ureD. Our analysis has identified two additional SNPs in ureD affecting amino acid positions 38 and 205, in both cases determining whether the encoded amino acid is leucine or proline. Phylogenetic analysis based on Ure protein sequences from a variety of urease-encoding bacteria demonstrates that the proline at position 38 is highly conserved among Gram-negative bacteria. Experiments reveal that the L38P substitution enhances urease enzyme activity; however, the L205P substitution does not. Multilocus sequence typing analysis for a variety of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli isolates combined with the ureD sequence reveals that except for a subset of the O157:H7 strains, neither the in vitro urease-positive phenotype nor the ureD sequence is phylogenetically restricted.

20615753|t|Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutations: a fundamentally new understanding of diffuse glioma?
20615753|a|The discovery of somatic mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) in glioblastomas was remarkable because the enzyme was not previously identified with any known oncogenic pathway. IDH1 is mutated in up to 75% of grade II and grade III diffuse gliomas. Apart from acute myeloid leukaemia, other tumour types do not carry IDH1 mutations. Mutations in a homologous gene, IDH2, have also been identified, although they are much rarer. Although TP53 mutations and 1p/19q codeletions are mutually exclusive in gliomas, in both of these genotypes IDH1 mutations are common. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are early events in the development of gliomas. Moreover, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are a major prognostic marker for overall and progression-free survival in grade II-IV gliomas. Mutated IDH1 has an altered catalytic activity that results in the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate. Molecularly, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are heterozygous, affect only a single codon, and rarely occur together. Because IDH1 does not belong to a traditional oncogenic pathway and is specifically and commonly mutated in gliomas, the altered enzymatic activity of IDH1 may provide a fundamentally new understanding of diffuse glioma.

21269685|t|Health and health-care systems in southeast Asia: diversity and transitions.
21269685|a|Southeast Asia is a region of enormous social, economic, and political diversity, both across and within countries, shaped by its history, geography, and position as a major crossroad of trade and the movement of goods and services. These factors have not only contributed to the disparate health status of the region's diverse populations, but also to the diverse nature of its health systems, which are at varying stages of evolution. Rapid but inequitable socioeconomic development, coupled with differing rates of demographic and epidemiological transitions, have accentuated health disparities and posed great public health challenges for national health systems, particularly the control of emerging infectious diseases and the rise of non-communicable diseases within ageing populations. While novel forms of health care are evolving in the region, such as corporatised public health-care systems (government owned, but operating according to corporate principles and with private-sector participation) and financing mechanisms to achieve universal coverage, there are key lessons for health reforms and decentralisation. New challenges have emerged with rising trade in health services, migration of the health workforce, and medical tourism. Juxtaposed between the emerging giant economies of China and India, countries of the region are attempting to forge a common regional identity, despite their diversity, to seek mutually acceptable and effective solutions to key regional health challenges. In this first paper in the Lancet Series on health in southeast Asia, we present an overview of key demographic and epidemiological changes in the region, explore challenges facing health systems, and draw attention to the potential for regional collaboration in health.

The first complete genome sequence of B. burgdorferi strain 31, available for more than a decade, has assisted research on the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Because a single genome sequence is not sufficient to understand the relationship between genotypic and geographic variation and disease phenotype, we determined the whole-genome sequences of 13 additional B. burgdorferi isolates that span the range of natural variation. These sequences should allow improved understanding of pathogenesis and provide a foundation for novel detection, diagnosis, and prevention strategies.

21689183|t|Identification of predicted seminal fluid proteins in Tribolium castaneum.
21689183|a|In several insect species, seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) have been demonstrated to be key regulators of male and female fitness through their ability to alter female physiology and behaviour. Tribolium castaneum is an economically important pest species and a model system for sexual selection research, but little is known about SFPs in this insect. To create a foundation for the study of T. castaneum SFPs, we used mass spectrometry to identify putative SFPs by comparing proteins detected in the male reproductive glands with those found in the reproductive tracts of virgin and mated females. Fourteen putative SFPs, thirteen with male biased expression, were identified through this approach. We also used reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to examine expression levels across different tissue types. We found strongly male-biased expression in 13 genes, nine of which were expressed only in male accessory gland tissue. This represents the first proteomic-based method of identifying putative SFPs in any coleopteran species, and is the first study in this species to identify putative SFPs that are likely transferred to the female. This work could lead to functional analyses of the role of SFPs in sexual selection, sexual conflict and potential control of a pest species.

21071191|t|Cercozoa comprises both EF-1alpha-containing and EFL-containing members.
21071191|a|Elongation factor 1alpha (EF-1alpha) and elongation factor-like protein (EFL) are considered to be functionally equivalent proteins involved in peptide synthesis. Eukaryotes can be fundamentally divided into 'EF-1alpha-containing' and 'EFL-containing' types. Recently, EF-1alpha and EFL genes have been surveyed across the diversity of eukaryotes to explore the origin and evolution of EFL genes. Although the phylum Cercozoa is a diverse group, gene data for either EFL or EF-1alpha are absent from all cercozoans except chlorarachniophytes which were previously defined as EFL-containing members. Our survey revealed that two members of the cercozoan subphylum Filosa (Thaumatomastix sp. and strain YPF610) are EFL-containing members. Importantly, we identified EF-1alpha genes from two members of Filosa (Paracercomonas marina and Paulinella chromatophora) and a member of the other subphylum Endomyxa (Filoreta japonica). All cercozoan EFL homologues could not be recovered as a monophyletic group in maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses, suggesting that lateral gene transfer was involved in the EFL evolution in this protist assemblage. In contrast, EF-1alpha analysis successfully recovered a monophyly of three homologues sampled from the two cercozoan subphyla. Based on the results, we postulate that cercozoan EF-1alpha genes have been vertically inherited, and the current EFL-containing species may have secondarily lost their EF-1alpha genes.

20637818|t|The Candida albicans Rgd1 is a RhoGAP protein involved in the control of filamentous growth.
20637818|a|Rho proteins are essential regulators of polarized growth in eukaryotic cells. These proteins are down-regulated in vivo by specific Rho GTPase Activating Proteins (RhoGAP). We investigated the role of Rgd1 RhoGAP, encoded by the Candida albicans RGD1 gene. We demonstrated that CaCdc42, CaRho3 and CaRho4 proteins had an intrinsic GTPase activity and that CaRgd1 stimulates in vitro GTP hydrolysis of these GTPases. Deletion of RGD1 in C. albicans results in sensitivity to low pH as already described for rgd1Delta in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The role of Rgd1 in survival at low pH is conserved in the two yeast species as the CaRGD1 gene complements the Scrgd1Delta sensitivity. By tagging the RhoGAP with GFP, we found that CaRgd1 is localized at the tip and cortex of growing cells and during cytokinesis at the septation sites in yeast and filamentous forms. We investigated the effect of CaRgd1 on the control of the polarized growth. Removing CaRGD1 alleles increased filamentous growth and cells lacking CaRgd1 presented longer germ tubes. Conversely, RGD1 overexpression restricted hyphae growth. Our results demonstrate that Rgd1 is critical for filamentous formation in C. albicans especially for filamentous elongation.

20962099|t|Replicative and transcriptional activities of hepatitis B virus in patients coinfected with hepatitis B and hepatitis delta viruses.
20962099|a|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) interplay was investigated by examining liver and serum samples from 21 coinfected and 22 HBV-monoinfected patients with chronic liver disease. Different real-time PCR assays were applied to evaluate intrahepatic amounts of HBV DNA, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), pre-S/S RNAs, and HDV RNA. Besides HBV DNA and HDV RNA levels, HBsAg concentrations in the sera were also determined. HDV-coinfected cases showed significantly lower median levels of serum HBV DNA (-5 log), intrahepatic relaxed-circular DNA (-2 log), and cccDNA (-2 log) than those of HBV-monoinfected cases. Interestingly, pgRNA and pre-S/S RNA amounts were significantly lower (both -1 log) in HDV-positive patients, whereas serum HBsAg concentrations were comparable between the two patient groups. Pre-S/S RNA and HBsAg amounts per cccDNA molecule were higher in HDV-positive patients (3-fold and 1 log, respectively), showing that HBV replication was reduced, whereas synthesis of envelope proteins was not specifically decreased. The ratios of cccDNA to intracellular total HBV DNA showed a larger proportion of cccDNA molecules in HDV-positive cases. For these patients, both intrahepatic and serum HDV RNA amounts were associated with cccDNA but not with HBsAg or HBV DNA levels. Finally, HBV genomes with large deletions in the basal core promoter/precore region were detected in 5/21 HDV-positive patients but in no HDV-negative patients and were associated with lower viremia levels. These findings provide significant information about the interference exerted by HDV on HBV replication and transcription activities in the human liver.

21521139|t|A review of the implications of heterozygosity and inbreeding on germplasm biodiversity and its conservation in the silkworm, Bombyx mori.
21521139|a|Abstract Silkworm genebanks assume paramount importance as the reservoirs of biodiversity and source of alleles that can be easily retrieved for genetic enhancement of popular breeds. More than 4000 Bombyx mori L (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) strains are currently available and these strains are maintained through continuous sibling mating. This repeated sibling mating makes the populations of each strain more homozygous, but leads to loss of unique and valuable genes through the process of inbreeding depression. Hence, it is essential to maintain a minimal degree of heterozygosity within the population of each silkworm strain, especially in the traditional geographic strains, to avoid such loss. As a result, accurate estimation of genetic diversity is becoming more important in silkworm genetic resources conservation. Application of molecular markers help estimate genetic diversity much more accurately than that of morphological traits. Since a minimal amount of heterozygosity in each silkworm strain is essential for better conservation by avoiding inbreeding depression, this article overviews both theoretical and practical importance of heterozygosity together with impacts of inbreeding depression and the merits and demerits of neutral molecular markers for measurements of both heterozygosity and inbreeding depression in the silkworm Bombyx mori.

21176790|t|Characterization of a polyketide synthase in Aspergillus niger whose product is a precursor for both dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin and naphtho-gamma-pyrone.
21176790|a|The genome sequencing of the fungus Aspergillus niger uncovered a large cache of genes encoding enzymes thought to be involved in the production of secondary metabolites yet to be identified. Identification and structural characterization of many of these predicted secondary metabolites are hampered by their low concentration relative to the known A. niger metabolites such as the naphtho-gamma-pyrone family of polyketides. We deleted a non-reducing PKS gene in A. niger strain ATCC 11414, a daughter strain of A. niger ATCC strain 1015 whose genome was sequenced by the DOE Joint Genome Institute. This PKS encoding gene we name albA is a predicted ortholog of alb1 from Aspergillus fumigatus which is responsible for production of the naphtho-gamma-pyrone precursor for the 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin/spore pigment. Our results show that the A. nigeralbA PKS is responsible for both the production of the spore pigment precursor and a family of naphtho-gamma-pyrones commonly found in significant quantity in A. niger culture extracts. The generation of an A. niger strain devoid of naphtho-gamma-pyrones will greatly facilitate the elucidation of cryptic biosynthetic pathways in this organism.

20880225|t|Recovery of ectomycorrhiza after 'nitrogen saturation' of a conifer forest.
20880225|a|Trees reduce their carbon (C) allocation to roots and mycorrhizal fungi in response to high nitrogen (N) additions, which should reduce the N retention capacity of forests. The time needed for recovery of mycorrhizas after termination of N loading remains unknown. Here, we report the long-term impact of N loading and the recovery of ectomycorrhiza after high N loading on a Pinus sylvestris forest. We analysed the N% and abundance of the stable isotope (15) N in tree needles and soil, soil microbial fatty acid biomarkers and fungal DNA. Needles in N-loaded plots became enriched in (15) N, reflecting decreased N retention by mycorrhizal fungi and isotopic discrimination against (15) N during loss of N. Meanwhile, needles in N-limited (control) plots became depleted in (15) N, reflecting high retention of (15) N by mycorrhizal fungi. N loading was terminated after 20yr. The delta(15) N and N% of the needles decreased 6yr after N loading had been terminated, and approached values in control plots after 15yr. This decrease, and the larger contributions compared with N-loaded plots of a fungal fatty acid biomarker and ectomycorrhizal sequences, suggest recovery of ectomycorrhiza. High N loading rapidly decreased the functional role of ectomycorrhiza in the forest N cycle, but significant recovery occurred within 6-15yr after termination of N loading.

21466554|t|Natal conditions alter age-specific reproduction but not survival or senescence in a long-lived bird of prey.
21466554|a|1. Natal conditions and senescence are two major factors shaping life-history traits of wild animals. However, such factors have rarely been investigated together, and it remains largely unknown whether they interact to affect age-specific performance. 2. We used 27 years of longitudinal data collected on tawny owls with estimates of prey density (field voles) from Kielder Forest (UK) to investigate how prey density at birth affects ageing patterns in reproduction and survival. 3. Natal conditions experienced by tawny owls, measured in terms of vole density, dramatically varied among cohorts and explained 87% of the deviance in first-year apparent survival (annual estimates ranging from 0*07 to 0*33). 4. We found evidence for senescence in survival for females as well as for males. Model-averaged estimates showed that adult survival probability declined linearly with age for females from age 1. In contrast, male survival probability, lower on average than for female, declined after a plateau at age 1-3. 5. We also found evidence for reproductive senescence (number of offspring). For females, reproductive performance increased until age 9 then declined. Males showed an earlier decline in reproductive performance with an onset of senescence at age 3. 6. Long-lasting effects of natal environmental conditions were sex specific. Female reproductive performance was substantially related to natal conditions (difference of 0*24 fledgling per breeding event between females born in the first or third quartile of vole density), whereas male performance was not. We found no evidence for tawny owls born in years with low prey density having accelerated rates of senescence. 7. Our results, combined with previous findings, suggest the way natal environmental conditions affect senescence varies not only across species but also within species according to gender and the demographic trait considered.
