0|t|Association of the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein with the 600-kDa retinoblastoma protein-associated factor, p600.
0|a|The human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein binds and inactivates the retinoblastoma protein, pRB. We have identified a cellular protein, p600, that binds to the E7 protein and to pRB. The p600 protein is a 600-kDa protein that is localized to the nucleus and is associated with the nuclear matrix. The p600 protein is phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro by the cyclin A-dependent protein kinase, cdk2. The p600 protein is also a substrate for the E7-associated protein phosphatase activity. The p600 protein may be a target for the E7-associated protein phosphatase activity and may be involved in the E7-mediated transformation of cells.
