16230339,Fibrinogen substrate recognition by staphylocoagulase.(pro)thrombin complexes.,"Thrombin generation and fibrinogen (Fbg) clotting are the ultimate proteolytic reactions in the blood coagulation pathway. Staphylocoagulase (SC), a protein secreted by the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, activates prothrombin (ProT) without proteolysis. The SC.(pro)thrombin complex recognizes Fbg as a specific substrate, converting it directly into fibrin. The crystal structure of a fully active SC fragment containing residues 1-325 (SC-(1-325)) bound to human prethrombin 2 showed previously that SC inserts its Ile(1)-Val(2) N terminus into the Ile(16) pocket of prethrombin 2, inducing a functional active site in the cognate zymogen conformationally. Exosite I of alpha-thrombin, the Fbg recognition site, and proexosite I on ProT are blocked by domain 2 of SC-(1-325). In the present studies, active site-labeled fluorescent ProT analogs were used to quantitate Fbg binding to the SC-(1-325).ProT complex. Fbg binding and cleavage are mediated by expression of a new Fbg-binding exosite on the SC-(1-325).ProT complex, resulting in formation of an (SC-(1-325).ProT)(2).Fbg pentameric complex with a dissociation constant of 8-34 nm. In both crystal structures, the SC-(1-325).(pre)thrombin complexes form dimers, with both proteinases/zymogens facing each other over a large U-shaped cleft, through which the Fbg substrate could thread. On this basis, a molecular model of the pentameric (SC-(1-325).thrombin)(2).Fbg encounter complex was generated, which explains the coagulant properties and efficient Fbg conversion. The results provide new insight into the mechanism that mediates high affinity Fbg binding and cleavage as a substrate of SC.(pro)thrombin complexes, a process that is central to the molecular pathology of S. aureus endocarditis."
16364312,Identification of otubain 1 as a novel substrate for the Yersinia protein kinase using chemical genetics and mass spectrometry.,"Yersinia encodes a protein kinase, YpkA, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton. Using an approach termed chemical genetics, we identified a 36-kDa substrate for YpkA in both J774 lysates and bovine brain cytosol. Mass spectrometry analysis identified this substrate as FLJ20113, an open reading frame that corresponds to otubain 1, a deubiquitinating enzyme implicated in immune cell clonal anergy. We demonstrate that otubain 1 is phosphorylated by YpkA in vitro and interacts with YpkA and actin in vivo. Identification of otubain 1 as a YpkA substrate suggests that regulation of immune cell anergy may be a survival mechanism for Yersinia."
15793585,Insights into hRPA32 C-terminal domain--mediated assembly of the simian virus 40 replisome.,"Simian virus 40 (SV40) provides a model system for the study of eukaryotic DNA replication, in which the viral protein, large T antigen (Tag), marshals human proteins to replicate the viral minichromosome. SV40 replication requires interaction of Tag with the host single-stranded DNA-binding protein, replication protein A (hRPA). The C-terminal domain of the hRPA32 subunit (RPA32C) facilitates initiation of replication, but whether it interacts with Tag is not known. Affinity chromatography and NMR revealed physical interaction between hRPA32C and the Tag origin DNA-binding domain, and a structural model of the complex was determined. Point mutations were then designed to reverse charges in the binding sites, resulting in substantially reduced binding affinity. Corresponding mutations introduced into intact hRPA impaired initiation of replication and primosome activity, implying that this interaction has a critical role in assembly and progression of the SV40 replisome."
7642611,"Characterization of physical interactions of the putative transcriptional adaptor, ADA2, with acidic activation domains and TATA-binding protein.","RNA polymerase II transcription requires functional interactions between activator proteins bound to upstream DNA sites and general factors bound to the core promoter. Accessory transcription factors, such as adaptors and coactivators, have important, but still unclear, roles in the activation process. We tested physical interactions of the putative adaptor ADA2 with activation domains derived from acidic activator proteins and with certain general transcription factors. ADA2 associated with the herpesvirus VP16 and yeast GCN4 activation domains but not with the activation domain of yeast HAP4, which previously was shown to be independent of ADA2 function in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the amino terminus of ADA2 directly interacted with the VP16 activation domain, suggesting that ADA2 provides determinants for interaction between activation domains and the adaptor complex. Both TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TFIIB have previously been shown to interact directly with the VP16 activation domain in vitro (Stringer, K. F., Ingles, C. J., and Greenblatt, J. (1990) Nature 345, 783-786; Lin, Y. S., Ha, I., Maldonado, E., Reinberg, D., and Green, M. R. (1991) Nature 353, 569-571). Interestingly, when binding was tested between VP16 and these general factors in yeast nuclear extracts, both factors interacted with VP16, but only the TBP/VP16 association was dependent on ADA2. In addition, ADA2 physically associated with TBP, but not with TFIIB. These results suggest that the role of ADA2 in transcriptional activation is to promote physical interaction between activation domains and TBP."
15109495,Interaction of the bovine papillomavirus E2 protein with Brd4 tethers the viral DNA to host mitotic chromosomes.,"The papillomavirus E2 protein tethers viral genomes to host mitotic chromosomes to ensure genome maintenance. We have identified the bromodomain protein Brd4 as a major cellular interacting partner of the bovine papillomavirus E2. Brd4 associates with mitotic chromosomes and colocalizes with E2 on mitotic chromosomes. The site of E2 binding maps to the C-terminal domain of Brd4. Expression of this C-terminal Brd4 domain functions in a dominant-negative manner to abrogate the colocalization of E2 with Brd4 on mitotic chromosomes, to block association of the viral episomes with Brd4, and to inhibit BPV-1 DNA-mediated cellular transformation. Brd4 also associates with HPV16 E2, indicating that Brd4 binding may be a shared property of all papillomavirus E2 proteins. The interaction of E2 with Brd4 is required to ensure the tethering of viral genomes to the host mitotic chromosomes for persistence of viral episomes in PV-infected cells."
16061792,"Association of the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein with the 600-kDa retinoblastoma protein-associated factor, p600.","The human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 gene encodes a multifunctional oncoprotein that can subvert multiple cellular regulatory pathways. The best-known cellular targets of the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein are the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein pRB and the related pocket proteins p107 and p130. However, there is ample evidence that E7 has additional cellular targets that contribute to its transforming potential. We isolated HPV-16 E7 associated cellular protein complexes by tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry and identified the 600-kDa retinoblastoma protein associated factor, p600, as a cellular target of E7. Association of E7 with p600 is independent of the pocket proteins and is mediated through the N terminal E7 domain, which is related to conserved region 1 of the adenovirus E1A protein and importantly contributes to cellular transformation independent of pRB binding. Depletion of p600 protein levels by RNA interference substantially decreased anchorage-independent growth in HPV-positive and -negative human cancer cells. Therefore, p600 is a cellular target of E7 that regulates cellular pathways that contribute to anchorage-independent growth and cellular transformation."
9499053,Association of the human papillomavirus type 11 E1 protein with histone H1.,"The E1 and E2 proteins are the only virus-encoded factors required for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA replication. The E1 protein is a DNA helicase responsible for initiation of DNA replication at the viral origin. Its recruitment to the origin is facilitated by binding to E2, for which specific recognition elements are located at the origin. The remaining replication functions for the virus, provided by the host cell's replication machinery, may be mediated by further interactions with E1 and E2. Histone H1 was identified as an HPV type 11 (HPV-11) E1-binding protein by far-Western blotting and by microsequence analyses of a 34-kDa protein purified by E1 affinity chromatography. E1 also bound in vitro to H1 isolated under native conditions in association with intact nucleosomes. In addition, E1 and H1 were coimmunoprecipitated by an E1 antiserum from a nuclear extract prepared from cells expressing recombinant E1. Bound H1 was displaced from HPV-11 DNA by the addition of E1, suggesting that E1 can promote replication initiation and elongation by alteration of viral chromatin structure and disruption of nucleosomes at the replication fork. Furthermore, a region of the HPV-11 genome containing the origin of replication was identified which had weaker affinity for H1 than that of the remaining genome. This result suggests that the presence of a DNA structure at or near the HPV origin facilitates initiation of DNA replication by exclusion of H1. These results are similar to those of studies of simian virus 40 DNA replication, in which a large T antigen-H1 interaction and an H1-resistant region at the origin of DNA replication have also been demonstrated."
16044149,Activation of the protein kinase B pathway by the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein occurs through a mechanism involving interaction with PP2A.,"Protein kinase B (PKB) or Akt is one of several second messenger kinases that are activated by cell attachment and growth factor signaling, and that transmit signals to the cell nucleus to inhibit apoptosis and thereby increase cell survival during proliferation. Other viral proteins target this pathway by increasing PKB/Akt phosphorylation, and this pathway has been implicated in the transformation of human keratinocytes by HPV E6 and E7, together with activated notch 1. Here, we examine how HPV E7 expression affects the phosphorylation of PKB. We show that HPV-16 E7 increases the level of phosphorylation of PKB in response to serum stimulation, by a mechanism independent of downregulation of PTEN phosphatase, a known inhibitor of the PI3K (PI3 kinase) pathway. The use of specific antibodies shows that some proportion of PKB/Akt that is phosphorylated both on threonine 308 and serine 473 is maintained in the presence of E7 in a PI3 kinase-independent manner, and is activated for phosphorylation of BAD, a known downstream target of PKB/Akt. Use of E7 mutants has ruled out both an inhibition of IGFBP-3, a known E7 target and PKB/Akt modulator, and the interaction of E7 with cellular pocket proteins, as being the mechanism for the PKB/Akt stimulation. PKB binds PP2A and is a known substrate of PP2A. Here, we show that HPV E7 also binds to both the 35 kDa catalytic and 65 kDa structural subunits of PP2A, an interaction that sequesters these subunits and inhibits their interaction with PKB, thereby maintaining PKB/Akt signaling by inhibiting its dephosphorylation."
12783858,Protein profiling with Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 reveals an interaction with the herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease HAUSP/USP7.,"The Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1) protein of Epstein-Barr virus is important for the replication, segregation, and transcriptional activation of latent Epstein-Barr virus genomes; has been implicated in host cell immortalization; and avoids proteasomal processing and cell-surface presentation. To gain insight into how EBNA1 fulfills these functions, we have profiled cellular protein interactions with EBNA1 using EBNA1 affinity chromatography and tandem affinity purification (TAP) of EBNA1 complexes from human cells (TAP-tagging). We discovered several new specific cellular protein interactions with EBNA1, including interactions with HAUSP/USP7, NAP1, template-activating factor-I beta/SET, CK2, and PRMT5, all of which play important cell regulatory roles. The ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 is a known target of herpes simplex virus, and the USP7-binding region of EBNA1 was mapped to amino acids 395-450. A mutation in EBNA1 that selectively disrupted binding to USP7 was found to cause a 4-fold increase in EBNA1 replication activity but had no effect on EBNA1 turnover and cell-surface presentation. The results suggest that USP7 can regulate the replication function of EBNA1 and that EBNA1 may influence cellular events by sequestering key regulatory proteins."
9824158,The BCL-6 POZ domain and other POZ domains interact with the co-repressors N-CoR and SMRT.,"Virtually all diffuse large cell lymphomas and a significant fraction of follicular lymphomas contain translocations and/or point mutations in the 5' non-coding region of the putative oncogene BCL-6, that are presumed to deregulate its expression. BCL-6 encodes a Cys2-His2 zinc finger transcriptional repressor with a POZ domain at its amino-terminus. The POZ (or BTB) domain, a 120-amino-acid motif, mediates homomeric and, in some proteins, heteromeric POZ-POZ interactions. In addition, the POZ domain is required for transcriptional repression of several proteins, including BCL-6. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified N-CoR and SMRT as BCL-6 interacting proteins. Both N-CoR and SMRT, which were originally identified as co-repressors for the unliganded nuclear thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors, are components of large complexes containing histone deacetylases. We show that the interaction between BCL-6 and these co-repressors is also detected in the more physiologically relevant mammalian two-hybrid assay. The POZ domain is necessary and sufficient for interaction with these co-repressors. BCL-6 and N-CoR co-localize to punctate regions of the nucleus. Furthermore, when BCL-6 is bound to its consensus recognition sequence in vivo, it can interact with N-CoR and SMRT. We find, in vitro, that POZ domains from a variety of other POZ domain-containing proteins, including the transcriptional repressor PLZF, as well as ZID, GAGA and a vaccinia virus protein, SalF17R, also interact with varying affinities with N-CoR and SMRT. We find that BCL-6 POZ domain mutations that disrupt the interaction with N-CoR and SMRT no longer repress transcription. In addition, these mutations no longer self associate suggesting that self interaction is required for interaction with the co-repressors and for repression. More recently N-CoR has also been implicated in transcriptional repression by the Mad/Mxi proteins. Our demonstration that N-CoR and SMRT interact with the POZ domain containing proteins indicates that these co-repressors are likely involved in the mediation of repression by multiple classes of repressors and may explain, in part, how POZ domain containing repressors mediate transcriptional repression."
16275649,Quantifying the specific binding between West Nile virus envelope domain III protein and the cellular receptor alphaVbeta3 integrin.,"A previous study has illustrated that the alphaVbeta3 integrin served as the functional receptor for West Nile virus (WNV) entry into cells. Domain III (DIII) of WNV envelope protein (E) was postulated to mediate virus binding to the cellular receptor. In this study, the specificity and affinity binding of WNV E DIII protein to alphaVbeta3 integrin was confirmed with co-immunoprecipitation and receptor competition assay. Binding of WNV E DIII protein to alphaVbeta3 integrin induced the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase that is required to mediate ligand-receptor internalization into cells. A novel platform was then developed using the atomic force microscopy to measure this specific binding force between WNV E DIII protein and the cellular receptor, alphaVbeta3 integrin. The single protein pair-interacting force measured was in the range of 45 +/- 5 piconewtons. This interacting force was highly specific as minimal force was measured in the WNV E DIII protein interaction with alphaVbeta5 integrin molecules and heparan sulfate. These experiments provided an insight to quantitate virus-receptor interaction. Force measurement using atomic force microscopy can serve to quantitatively analyze the effect of candidate drugs that modulate virus-host receptor affinity."
15144954,Nucleolar protein NPM interacts with HDM2 and protects tumor suppressor protein p53 from HDM2-mediated degradation.,"Nucleophosmin (NPM, B23) is an abundant nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in ribosome biogenesis, and interacts with tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb. Here we show that NPM is a UV damage response protein that undergoes nucleoplasmic redistribution and regulates p53 and HDM2 levels and their interaction. By utilizing RNAi approaches and analyses of endogenous and ectopically expressed proteins, we demonstrate that NPM binds HDM2 and acts as a negative regulator of p53-HDM2 interaction. Viral stress, enforced by expression of Kaposi's sarcoma virus K cyclin, causes NPM redistribution, K cyclin-NPM association, and p53 stabilization by dissociation of HDM2-p53 complexes. The results demonstrate novel associations of HDM2 and K cyclin with NPM and implicate NPM as a crucial controller of p53 through inhibition of HDM2."
15047801,"RoXaN, a novel cellular protein containing TPR, LD, and zinc finger motifs, forms a ternary complex with eukaryotic initiation factor 4G and rotavirus NSP3.","Rotavirus mRNAs are capped but not polyadenylated, and viral proteins are translated by the cellular translation machinery. This is accomplished through the action of the viral nonstructural protein NSP3, which specifically binds the 3' consensus sequence of viral mRNAs and interacts with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4G I. To further our understanding of the role of NSP3 in rotavirus replication, we looked for other cellular proteins capable of interacting with this viral protein. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified a novel cellular protein-binding partner for rotavirus NSP3. This 110-kDa cellular protein, named RoXaN (rotavirus X protein associated with NSP3), contains a minimum of three regions predicted to be involved in protein-protein or nucleic acid-protein interactions. A tetratricopeptide repeat region, a protein-protein interaction domain most often found in multiprotein complexes, is present in the amino-terminal region. In the carboxy terminus, at least five zinc finger motifs are observed, further suggesting the capacity of RoXaN to bind other proteins or nucleic acids. Between these two regions exists a paxillin leucine-aspartate repeat (LD) motif which is involved in protein-protein interactions. RoXaN is capable of interacting with NSP3 in vivo and during rotavirus infection. Domains of interaction were mapped and correspond to the dimerization domain of NSP3 (amino acids 163 to 237) and the LD domain of RoXaN (amino acids 244 to 341). The interaction between NSP3 and RoXaN does not impair the interaction between NSP3 and eIF4G I, and a ternary complex made of NSP3, RoXaN, and eIF4G I can be detected in rotavirus-infected cells, implicating RoXaN in translation regulation."
17728244,Stimulation of c-Myc transcriptional activity by vIRF-3 of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is associated with two lymphoproliferative disorders, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and Castleman disease. In PEL, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is present in a latent form expressing only few viral genes. Among them is a viral homologue of cellular interferon regulatory factors, vIRF-3. To study the role of vIRF-3 in PEL lymphomagenesis, we analyzed the interaction of vIRF-3 with cellular proteins. Using yeast two-hybrid screen, we detected the association between vIRF-3 and c-Myc suppressor, MM-1alpha. The vIRF-3 and MM-1alpha interaction was also demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay and coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous vIRF-3 and MM-1alpha in PEL-derived cell lines. Overexpression of vIRF-3 enhanced the c-Myc-dependent transcription of the gene cdk4. Addressing the molecular mechanism of the vIRF-3-mediated stimulation, we demonstrated that the association between MM-1alpha and c-Myc was inhibited by vIRF-3. Furthermore, the recruitment of vIRF-3 to the cdk4 promoter and the elevated levels of the histone H3 acetylation suggest the direct involvement of vIRF-3 in the activation of c-Myc-mediated transcription. These findings indicate that vIRF-3 can effectively stimulate c-Myc function in PEL cells and consequently contribute to de-regulation of B-cell growth and differentiation."
16230350,A mammalian chromatin remodeling complex with similarities to the yeast INO80 complex.,"The mammalian Tip49a and Tip49b proteins belong to an evolutionarily conserved family of AAA+ ATPases. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, orthologs of Tip49a and Tip49b, called Rvb1 and Rvb2, respectively, are subunits of two distinct ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, SWR1 and INO80. We recently demonstrated that the mammalian Tip49a and Tip49b proteins are integral subunits of a chromatin remodeling complex bearing striking similarities to the S. cerevisiae SWR1 complex (Cai, Y., Jin, J., Florens, L., Swanson, S. K., Kusch, T., Li, B., Workman, J. L., Washburn, M. P., Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 13665-13670). In this report, we identify a new mammalian Tip49a- and Tip49b-containing ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, which includes orthologs of 8 of the 15 subunits of the S. cerevisiae INO80 chromatin remodeling complex as well as at least five additional subunits unique to the human INO80 (hINO80) complex. Finally, we demonstrate that, similar to the yeast INO80 complex, the hINO80 complex exhibits DNA- and nucleosome-activated ATPase activity and catalyzes ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding."
12660167,ICP27 interacts with SRPK1 to mediate HSV splicing inhibition by altering SR protein phosphorylation.,"Infection with some viruses can alter cellular mRNA processing to favor viral gene expression. We present evidence that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) protein ICP27, which contributes to host shut-off by inhibiting pre-mRNA splicing, interacts with essential splicing factors termed SR proteins and affects their phosphorylation. During HSV-1 infection, phosphorylation of several SR proteins was reduced and this correlated with a subnuclear redistribution. Exogenous SR proteins restored splicing in ICP27-inhibited nuclear extracts and SR proteins isolated from HSV-1-infected cells activated splicing in uninfected S100 extracts, indicating that inhibition occurs by a reversible mechanism. Spliceosome assembly was blocked at the pre-spliceosomal complex A stage. Furthermore, we show that ICP27 interacts with SRPK1 and relocalizes it to the nucleus; moreover, SRPK1 activity was altered in the presence of ICP27 in vitro. We propose that ICP27 modifies SRPK1 activity resulting in hypophosphorylation of SR proteins impairing their ability to function in spliceosome assembly."
12925958,Hepatitis C virus NS5A as a potential viral Bcl-2 homologue interacts with Bax and inhibits apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells with butyrate can induce apoptosis irrespective of hepatitis B virus integration. No information is available, however, regarding the effect of butyrate on HCC in the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) because some HCV proteins can regulate cell survival. By gene transfer, we found that HCV core enhances but HCV NS5A antagonizes sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB)-induced apoptosis in HCC cells, which is independent of p53. We then chose the p53-negative Hep3B HCC cell to investigate the mechanism of anti-apoptosis mediated by NS5A. In the NaPB-treated Hep3B cells without NS5A expression, induction of apoptosis was associated with Bax redistribution from the cytosol to the nucleus interior and subsequently, to a nuclear membrane-bound form. In the NS5A expressing Hep3B cells, NaPB treatment also triggered relocalization of both Bax and NS5A from the cytosol to the nucleus interior but Bax retained inside the nucleus and did not finally move to the nuclear membrane. Using double immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that NS5A co-localizes and interacts with Bax in the nucleus. The HCV NS5A protein was further found to contain Bcl-2 homology domains (BH3, BH1 and BH2). Additional studies using deleted NS5A constructs were carried out to determine whether the BH2 domain or nuclear localization signal (NLS) in NS5A is required for interaction with Bax in the nucleus or inhibition of apoptosis. NS5A with deletion of both BH2 domain and NLS localized in the cytoplasm, dissociated with Bax, and lost anti-apoptosis activity during NaPB treatment. In contrast, NS5A with intact BH domains except NLS still bound directly to Bax in the perinuclear region or the nucleus, but showed less association with Bax in the nucleus and lower effect in apoptosis inhibition than full-length NS5A. These results suggest that HCV NS5A as a Bcl-2 homologue interacts with Bax to protect p53-negative HCC cells from NaPB-induced apoptosis."
10318918,"NS5A, a nonstructural protein of hepatitis C virus, binds growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 adaptor protein in a Src homology 3 domain/ligand-dependent manner and perturbs mitogenic signaling.","Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an emerging global epidemic causing severe liver disorders, the molecular mechanisms of HCV pathogenesis remain elusive. The NS5A nonstructural protein of HCV contains several proline-rich sequences consistent with Src homology (SH) 3-binding sites found in cellular signaling molecules. Here, we demonstrate that NS5A specifically bound to growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) adaptor protein. Immunoblot analysis of anti-Grb2 immune complexes derived from HeLa S3 cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (VV) expressing NS5A revealed an interaction between NS5A and Grb2 in vivo. An inactivating point mutation in the N-terminal SH3 domain, but not in the C-terminal SH3 domain, of Grb2 displayed significant diminished binding to NS5A. However, the same mutation in both SH3 regions completely abrogated Grb2 binding to NS5A, implying that the two SH3 domains bind in cooperative fashion to NS5A. Further, mutational analysis of NS5A assigned the SH3-binding region to a proline-rich motif that is highly conserved among HCV genotypes. Importantly, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) was inhibited in HeLa S3 cells infected with NS5A-expressing recombinant VV but not recombinant VV control. Additionally, HeLa cells stably expressing NS5A were refractory to ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by exogenous epidermal growth factor. Moreover, the coupling of NS5A to Grb2 in these cells was induced by epidermal growth factor stimulation. Therefore, NS5A may function to perturb Grb2-mediated signaling pathways by selectively targeting the adaptor. These findings highlight a viral interceptor of cellular signaling with potential implications for HCV pathogenesis."
14993658,The hepatitis C virus NS5A protein binds to members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases and regulates kinase activity.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural NS5A protein has been shown to associate with a variety of cellular signalling proteins. Of particular interest is the observation that a highly conserved C-terminal polyproline motif in NS5A was able to interact with the Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains of the adaptor protein Grb2. As it has previously been shown that specific polyproline motifs can interact with a range of SH3 domains, we investigated whether NS5A was capable of interacting with other SH3 domain-containing proteins. We show here that NS5A interacts with the SH3 domains of members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases: a combination of in vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an interaction between NS5A and Hck, Lck, Lyn and Fyn, but interestingly not Src itself. Mutational analysis confirmed that the polyproline motif responsible for binding to Grb2 also bound to the SH3 domains of Hck, Lck, Lyn and Fyn. Furthermore, a previously unidentified polyproline motif, adjacent to the first motif, was also able to mediate binding to the SH3 domain of Lyn. Using transient transfections and Huh-7 cells harbouring a persistently replicating subgenomic HCV replicon we demonstrate that NS5A bound to native Src-family kinases in vivo and differentially modulated kinase activity, inhibiting Hck, Lck and Lyn but activating Fyn. Lastly, we show that signalling pathways controlled by Src-family kinases are modulated in replicon cells. We conclude that the interactions between NS5A and Src-family kinases are physiologically relevant and may play a role in either virus replication or pathogenesis."
9372953,Functional interaction of a novel cellular protein with the papillomavirus E2 transactivation domain.,"The transactivation domain (AD) of bovine papillomavirus type 1 E2 stimulates gene expression and DNA replication. To identify cellular proteins that interact with this 215-amino-acid domain, we used a transactivation-defective mutant as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the cDNA of one plasmid isolated in this screen encodes a 37-kDa nuclear protein that specifically binds to an 82-amino-acid segment within the E2 AD. Mutants with point mutations within this E2 domain were isolated based on their inability to interact with AMF-1 and were found to be unable to stimulate transcription. These mutants also exhibited defects in viral DNA replication yet retained binding to the viral E1 replication initiator protein. Overexpression of AMF-1 stimulated transactivation by both wild-type E2 and a LexA fusion to the E2 AD, indicating that AMF-1 is a positive effector of the AD of E2. We conclude that interaction with AMF-1 is necessary for the transcriptional activation function of the E2 AD in mammalian cells."
9512561,Interaction between the N-terminus of human topoisomerase I and SV40 large T antigen.,"We have attempted to identify human topoisomerase I-binding proteins in order to gain information regarding the cellular roles of this protein and the cytotoxic mechanisms of the anticancer drug camptothecin, which specifically targets topoisomerase I. In the course of this work we identified an interaction between the N-terminus of human topoisomerase I and the SV40 T antigen that is detectable in vitro using both affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation. Additional results indicate that this interaction does not require intermediary DNA or stoichiometric quantities of other proteins. Furthermore, the interaction is detectable in vivo using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Two binding sites for T antigen are apparent on the topoisomerase I protein: one consisting of amino acids 1-139, the other present in the 383-765 region of the protein. Interestingly, nucleolin, which binds the 166-210 region of topoisomerase I, is able to bind an N-terminal fragment of topoisomerase I concurrently with T antigen. Taken together with our prior identification of nucleolin as a topoisomerase I-binding protein, the current results suggest that helicase-binding is a major role of the N-terminus of human topoisomerase I and that the resultant helicase-topoisomerase complex may function as a eukaryotic gyrase."
16135803,p73 Interacts with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat in astrocytic cells and prevents its acetylation on lysine 28.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat is a potent transcriptional activator of the HIV-1 promoter and also has the ability to modulate a number of cellular regulatory circuits including apoptosis. Tat exerts its effects through interaction with viral as well as cellular proteins. Here, we studied the influence of p73, a protein that is implicated in apoptosis and cell cycle control, on Tat functions in the central nervous system. Protein interaction studies using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated the association of Tat with p73. Tat bound to the N-terminal region of p73 spanning amino acids 1 to 120, and this interaction required the cysteine-rich domain (amino acids 30 to 40) of Tat. Association of p73 with Tat prevented the acetylation of Tat on lysine 28 by PCAF. Functional studies including RNA interference showed that p73 inhibited Tat stimulation of the HIV-1 promoter. Furthermore, p73 prevented the interaction of Tat with cyclin T1 in vitro but not in vivo. These findings suggest possible new therapeutic approaches, using p73, for Tat-mediated AIDS pathogenesis."
9311902,Conserved interaction of the papillomavirus E2 transcriptional activator proteins with human and yeast TFIIB proteins.,"Papillomavirus early gene expression is regulated by the virus gene-encoded E2 proteins. The best-characterized E2 protein, encoded by bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1), has been shown to interact with basal transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and the TATA binding protein basal transcription factor (N. M. Rank and P. F. Lambert, J. Virol. 69:6323-6334, 1995). We demonstrate that the potent E2 transcriptional activator protein encoded by a gene of human PV type 16 also interacts with TFIIB in vitro. Moreover, a direct comparison of domains within human TFIIB (hTFIIB) required for VP16 and BPV-1 E2 indicates that these acidic activators interact with hTFIIB in a qualitatively similar manner. Our mapping experiments identify hTFIIB interaction domains within the amino-terminal activation domain of BPV-1 E2. Finally, we demonstrate in vitro interaction between Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFIIB and BPV-1 E2, an observation that is consistent with the importance of the E2-TFIIB interaction for BPV-1 E2 transactivation in both systems."
12200142,Interaction of oncogenic papillomavirus E6 proteins with fibulin-1.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the primary risk factor for the development of cervical cancer. The papillomavirus E6 gene is essential for virus-induced cellular transformation and the viral life cycle. Important insight into the mechanism of E6 function came from the discovery that cancer-related HPV E6 proteins promote the degradation of the tumor suppressor p53. However, mounting evidence indicates that interaction with p53 does not mediate all E6 activities. To explore the p53-independent functions of E6, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified fibulin-1 as an E6 binding protein. Fibulin-1 is a calcium-binding plasma and extracellular matrix protein that has been implicated in cellular transformation and tumor invasion. The interaction between E6 and fibulin-1 was demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo assays. Fibulin-1 is associated specifically with cancer-related HPV E6s and the transforming bovine papillomavirus type 1 E6. Significantly, overexpression of fibulin-1 specifically inhibited E6-mediated transformation. These results suggest that fibulin-1 plays an important role in the biological activities of E6."
17673209,Different activities of the largest subunit of replication protein A cooperate during SV40 DNA replication.,"Replication protein A (RPA) is a stable heterotrimeric complex consisting of p70, p32 and p14 subunits. The protein plays a crucial role in SV40 minichromosome replication. Peptides of p70 representing interaction sites for the smaller two subunits, DNA as well as the viral initiator protein large T-antigen (Tag) and the cellular DNA polymerase alpha-primase (Pol) all interfered with the replication process indicating the importance of the different p70 activities in this process. Inhibition by the peptide disrupting protein-protein interactions was observed only during the pre-initiation stage prior to primer synthesis, suggesting the formation of a stable initiation complex between RPA, Tag and Pol at the primer end."
10369867,Identification of survival motor neuron as a transcriptional activator-binding protein.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuro-muscular disease characterized by specific degeneration of spinal cord anterior horn cells and subsequent muscle atrophy. Survival motor neuron ( SMN ), located on chromosome 5q13, is the SMA-determining gene. In the nucleus, SMN is present in large foci called gems, the function of which is not yet known, while cytoplasmic SMN has been implicated in snRNP biogenesis. In SMA patients, SMN protein levels and the number of gems generally correlate with disease severity, suggesting a critical nuclear function for SMN. In a screen for proteins associated with the nuclear transcription activator 'E2' of papillomavirus, two independent SMN cDNAs were isolated. The E2 and SMN proteins were found to associate specifically in vitro and in vivo. Expression of SMN enhanced E2-dependent transcriptional activation, and patient-derived SMN missense mutations reduced E2 gene expression. Our results demonstrate that SMN interacts with a nuclear transcription factor and imply that SMN may serve a role in regulating gene expression. These observations suggest that SMA may in part result from abnormal gene expression and that E2 may influence viral gene expression through SMN interaction."
16364321,Physical and functional interactions between STAT3 and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded LANA.,"The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is known to modulate viral and cellular gene expression. We show that LANA directly associates with an interleukin-6 signal transducer, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and that LANA enhances the transcriptional activity of STAT3. Coimmunoprecipitation studies documented a physical interaction between LANA and STAT3 in transiently transfected 293T cells as well as the KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell line. Furthermore, small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of LANA expression decreased the STAT3-dependent transcription in KSHV-positive PEL cells, whereas overexpression of LANA enhanced STAT3 activity in KSHV-negative B lymphoma cells. These data demonstrate that LANA is a transcriptional co-activator of STAT3, and may have implications for the pathogenesis of KSHV-associated diseases."
16405965,Raf-1 kinase associates with Hepatitis C virus NS5A and regulates viral replication.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that frequently causes persistent infection associated with severe liver disease. HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is essential for viral replication. Here, the kinase Raf-1 was identified as a novel cellular binding partner of NS5A, binding to the C-terminal domain of NS5A. Raf-1 colocalizes with NS5A in the HCV replication complex. The interaction of NS5A with Raf-1 results in increased Raf-1 phosphorylation at serine 338. Integrity of Raf-1 is crucial for HCV replication: inhibition of Raf-1 by the small-molecule inhibitor BAY43-9006 or downregulation of Raf-1 by siRNA attenuates viral replication."
18539148,HSV-1 ICP27 suppresses NF-kappaB activity by stabilizing IkappaBalpha.,"Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is associated with the transcriptional activation of genes encoding chemokines, adhesion molecules, cytokines, and anti-apoptotic proteins, which are key components in immune responses and viral infection. Many viruses modulate NF-kappaB through numerous viral gene products to allow productive infections and immune escape. Here we report that herpes simplex virus-1 infected cell protein 27 (HSV-1 ICP27), an immediate early protein of HSV-1, represses NF-kappaB activity through binding to inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaBalpha), blocking phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha, and stabilizing IkappaBalpha. These data may explain how NF-kappaB activity is regulated by ICP27 to escape immune responses during the very early period of HSV-1 infection."
15611062,The SV40 large T antigen contains a decoy phosphodegron that mediates its interactions with Fbw7/hCdc4.,"Cell transformation by simian virus 40 (SV40) results mostly from the highly oncogenic activities of the large T antigen (LT), which corrupts the cellular checkpoint mechanisms that guard cell division and the transcription, replication, and repair of DNA. The most prominent LT targets are the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and p53. Here we report that LT binds directly to Fbw7, the substrate recognition component of the SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase and a human tumor suppressor. LT binding mislocalizes the nucleolar Fbw7gamma isoform to the nucleoplasm. Interestingly, the binding of LT to Fbw7 occurs via a decoy phospho-epitope within the C terminus of LT that closely mimics the consensus Cdc4 phospho-degron found within Fbw7 substrates. We demonstrate that, using this mode of interaction, LT can interfere with Fbw7-driven cyclin E turnover in vivo and causes increased cyclin E-associated kinase activity. Our data suggest that LT competes with cellular proteins for Fbw7 binding in a substrate-like fashion."
16227293,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr interacts with antiapoptotic mitochondrial protein HAX-1.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 viral protein R (Vpr) is required for viral pathogenesis and has been implicated in T-cell apoptosis through its activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9 and perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential. To understand better Vpr-mitochondria interaction, we report here the identification of antiapoptotic mitochondrial protein HAX-1 as a novel Vpr target. We show that Vpr and HAX-1 physically associate with each other. Overexpression of Vpr in cells dislocates HAX-1 from its normal residence in mitochondria and creates mitochondrion instability and cell death. Conversely, overexpression of HAX-1 suppressed the proapoptotic activity of Vpr."
16226257,Binding interaction of SARS coronavirus 3CL(pro) protease with vacuolar-H+ ATPase G1 subunit.,"The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important issue for treatment and prevention of SARS. Recently, SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) protease has been implied to be possible relevance to SARS-CoV pathogenesis. In this study, we intended to identify potential 3CL(pro)-interacting cellular protein(s) using the phage-displayed human lung cDNA library. The vacuolar-H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) G1 subunit that contained a 3CL(pro) cleavage site-like motif was identified as a 3CL(pro)-interacting protein, as confirmed using the co-immunoprecipitation assay and the relative affinity assay. In addition, our result also demonstrated the cleavage of the V-ATPase G1 fusion protein and the immunoprecipitation of cellular V-ATPase G1 by the 3CL(pro). Moreover, loading cells with SNARF-1 pH-sensitive dye showed that the intracellular pH in 3CL(pro)-expressing cells was significantly lower as compared to mock cells."
16844119,Hepatitis C virus non-structural protein NS5A interacts with FKBP38 and inhibits apoptosis in Huh7 hepatoma cells.,"Hepatitis C virus non-structural protein NS5A plays an important role in viral replication and various cellular events. To gain further insight into the function of NS5A, we screened a human fetal liver cDNA library for its interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. FKBP38, a 38 kDa immunosuppressant FK506-binding protein, was identified and its interaction with NS5A was confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo. The interaction was mapped to the amino acids 148-236 of NS5A containing a BH domain (Bcl-2 homology domain). Besides, both NS5A and FKBP38 were found to localize in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, NS5A stably expressing Huh7 hepatoma cells showed more resistance to apoptosis and such inhibition of apoptosis could specifically be abrogated by depletion of FKBP38 using RNA interference. These results indicate that HCV NS5A inhibits apoptosis through interaction with FKBP38."
10702287,Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein modulates transcription through a novel cellular transcription factor SRCAP.,"Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein transcriptionally modulates cellular genes and promotes cell growth. NS5A is likely to exert its activity in concert with cellular factor(s). Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have demonstrated that NS5A interacts with the C-terminal end of a newly identified cellular transcription factor, SRCAP. The authenticity of this interaction was verified by a mammalian two-hybrid assay, in vitro pull-down experiment, and an in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assay in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. An in vitro transient transfection assay demonstrated that SRCAP can efficiently activate transcription when recruited by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain to the promoter. However, down-regulation of p21 promoter activity by NS5A was enhanced following ectopic expression of SRCAP. Together these results suggest that the interaction of NS5A and SRCAP may be one of the mechanisms by which NS5A exerts its effect on cell growth regulation contributing to hepatitis C virus-mediated pathogenesis."
17255933,Staphylococcus aureus protein A activates TACE through EGFR-dependent signaling.,"Among the many adhesins and toxins expressed by Staphylococcus aureus, protein A is an exceptionally complex virulence factor, known to interact with multiple eukaryotic targets, particularly those with immunological functions. Protein A acts as a ligand that can mimic TNF-alpha to activate TNFR1 and subsequent proinflammatory signaling. It also stimulates the cleavage of TNFR1 from the surface of epithelial cells and macrophages, which serves to limit TNF-alpha signaling. We characterized the signaling pathway responsible for TNFR1 shedding and identified protein A mutants which could activate TNFR1-dependent signaling, but were unable to activate TACE, the TNFR1 sheddase. Activation of TACE was dependent upon a discrete interaction between the previously defined IgG-binding domain of protein A and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which in turn induced TACE phosphorylation through a c-Src-erk1/2-mediated cascade. This novel interaction was independent of the autocrine activation of EGFR and protein A-induced TGF-alpha was neither required nor sufficient to activate TNFR1 shedding. Thus, staphylococci exploit the ubiquitous and multifunctional EGFR to regulate the availability of TNFR1 on mucosal and immune cells."
16376880,The X protein of hepatitis B virus binds to the F box protein Skp2 and inhibits the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of c-Myc.,"The HBx protein of hepatitis B virus is involved in deregulation of cell cycle and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Since c-Myc also plays an important role in cell proliferation and tumor development, we studied its regulation by HBx in a human hepatoma cell line. Co-expression of HBx and c-Myc resulted in increased stability of intracellular c-Myc. HBx blocked the ubiquitination of Myc through a direct interaction with the F box region of Skp2 and destabilization of the SCF(Skp2) complex. We suggest that sustained presence of c-Myc combined with mitogenic activity inherent to HBx may be associated with cell cycle deregulation and transformation."
9927201,Adenovirus early region 1A protein binds to mammalian SUG1-a regulatory component of the proteasome.,"Adenovirus early region 1A (Ad E1A) is a multifunctional protein which is essential for adenovirus-mediated transformation and oncogenesis. Whilst E1A is generally considered to exert its influence on recipient cells through regulation of transcription it also increases the level of cellular p53 by increasing the protein half-life. With this in view, we have investigated the relationship of Ad E1A to the proteasome, which is normally responsible for degradation of p53. Here we have shown that both Ad5 and Ad12 E1A 12S and 13S proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated with proteasomes and that the larger Ad12 E1A protein binds strongly to at least three components of the 26S but not 20S proteasome. One of these interacting species has been identified as mammalian SUGI, a proteasome regulatory component which also plays a role in the cell as a mediator of transcription. In vitro assays have demonstrated a direct interaction between Ad12 E1A 13S protein and mouse SUGI. Following infection of human cells with Ad5 wt and Ad5 mutants with lesions in the E1A gene it has been shown that human SUG1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with full-length E1A and with E1A carrying a deletion in conserved region 1 which is the region considered to be responsible for increased expression of p53. We have concluded therefore that Ad EIA binds strongly to SUGI but that this interaction is not responsible for inhibition of proteasome activity. This is consistent with the observation that purified Ad12 E1A inhibits the activity of the purified 20S but not 26S proteasomes. We have also demonstrated that SUGI can be co-immunoprecipitated with SV40 T and therefore we suggest that this may represent a common interaction of transforming proteins of DNA tumour viruses."
14963045,Helicobacter pylori CagA induces Ras-independent morphogenetic response through SHP-2 recruitment and activation.,"The CagA protein of Helicobacter pylori, which is injected from the bacteria into bacteria-attached gastric epithelial cells, is associated with gastric carcinoma. CagA is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases, binds the SH2 domain-containing SHP-2 phosphatase in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner, and deregulates its enzymatic activity. We established AGS human gastric epithelial cells that inducibly express wild-type or a phosphorylation-resistant CagA, in which tyrosine residues constituting the EPIYA motifs were substituted with alanines. Upon induction, wild-type CagA, but not the mutant CagA, elicited strong elongation of cell shape, termed the ""hummingbird"" phenotype. Time-lapse video microscopic analysis revealed that the CagA-expressing cells exhibited a marked increase in cell motility with successive rounds of elongation-contraction processes. Inhibition of CagA phosphorylation by an Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, or knockdown of SHP-2 expression by small interference RNA (siRNA) abolished the CagA-mediated hummingbird phenotype. The morphogenetic activity of CagA also required Erk MAPK but was independent of Ras or Grb2. In AGS cells, CagA prolonged duration of Erk activation in response to serum stimulation. Conversely, inhibition of SHP-2 expression by siRNA abolished the sustained Erk activation. Thus, SHP-2 acts as a positive regulator of Erk activity in AGS cells. These results indicate that SHP-2 is involved in the Ras-independent modification of Erk signals that is necessary for the morphogenetic activity of CagA. Our work therefore suggests a key role of SHP-2 in the pathological activity of H. pylori virulence factor CagA."
18356299,COPI coatomer complex proteins facilitate the translocation of anthrax lethal factor across vesicular membranes in vitro.,"The delivery of the diphtheria toxin catalytic domain (DTA) from acidified endosomes into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells requires protein-protein interactions between the toxin and a cytosolic translocation factor (CTF) complex. A conserved peptide motif, T1, within the DT transmembrane helix 1 mediates these interactions. Because the T1 motif is also present in the N-terminal segments of lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF) in anthrax toxin, we asked whether LF entry into the cell might also be facilitated by target cell cytosolic proteins. In this study, we have used LFnDTA and its associated ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (DTA) to determine the requirements for LF translocation from the lumen of endosomal vesicles to the external medium in vitro. Although low-level release of LFnDTA from enriched endosomal vesicles occurs in the absence of added factors, translocation was enhanced by the addition of cytosolic proteins and ATP to the reaction mixture. We show by GST-LFn pull-down assays that LFn specifically interacts with at least zeta-COP and beta-COP of the COPI coatomer complex. Immunodepletion of COPI coatomer complex and associated proteins from cytosolic extracts blocks in vitro LFnDTA translocation. Translocation may be reconstituted by the addition of partially purified bovine COPI to the translocation assay mixture. Taken together, these data suggest that the delivery of LF to the cytosol requires either COPI coatomer complex or a COPI subcomplex for translocation from the endosomal lumen. This facilitated delivery appears to use a mechanism that is analogous to that of DT entry."
18337511,NFAR-1 and -2 modulate translation and are required for efficient host defense.,"We report here that the alternatively spliced nuclear factors associated with double-stranded RNA, NFAR-1 (90 kDa) and -2 (110 kDa), are involved in retaining cellular transcripts in intranuclear foci and can regulate the export of mRNA to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the NFAR proteins were found to remain associated with exported ribonucleoprotein complexes. Loss of NFAR function, which was embryonic-lethal, caused an increase in protein synthesis rates, an effect augmented by the presence of the mRNA export factors TAP, p15, or Rae1. Significantly, NFAR depletion in normal murine fibroblasts rendered these cells dramatically susceptible to vesicular stomatitis virus replication. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the NFARs exert influence on mRNA trafficking and the modulation of translation rates and may constitute an innate immune translational surveillance mechanism important in host defense countermeasures against virus infection."
17909182,Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen stabilizes intracellular activated Notch by targeting the Sel10 protein.,"Deregulation of the evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling is highly correlated with oncogenesis. Intracellular activated Notch (ICN) is a protooncogene linked to the transcription activation of a number of cellular genes involved in cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and proliferation. Stability of ICN is tightly regulated by the Sel10-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Sel10 can function as a negative regulator of Notch and exhibits activities of a tumor-suppressor protein. This article shows that the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) directly interacts with Sel10 and forms a complex in KSHV-infected cells. This results in suppression of ICN ubiquitination and degradation. The carboxyl terminus of LANA interacts with the F-box and WD40 domains of Sel10 and competes with ICN for binding to Sel10. This elevated level of ICN is also critical for maintaining the enhanced proliferation of KSHV-infected tumor cells. These findings describe a mechanism by which the KSHV-encoded LANA protein regulates ubiquitination of ICN mediated by the F-box component of the E3 ligase Sel10, leading to proliferation of the virus-infected cells."
18408009,USP11 stabilizes HPV-16E7 and further modulates the E7 biological activity.,"HPV-16E7 is a major transforming protein, which has been implicated in the development of cervical cancer. The stability of E7 is thus important to ensure its fully functional status. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that USP11 (ubiquitin-specific protease 11), a member of a protein family that cleaves polyubiquitin chains and/or ubiquitin precursors, interacts and forms a specific complex with HPV-16E7. Our results indicate that the USP11 can greatly increase the steady state level of HPV-16E7 by reducing ubiquitination and attenuating E7 degradation. In contrast, a catalytically inactive mutant of USP11 abolished the deubiquitinating ability and returned E7 to a normal rate of degradation. Moreover, USP11 not only protected E7 from ubiquitination but also influenced E7 function as a modulator of cell growth status. These results suggest that USP11 plays an important role in regulating the levels of E7 protein and subsequently affects the biological function of E7 as well as its contribution to cell transformation by HPV-16E7."
16205631,Bovine papillomavirus E5 oncoprotein binds to the activated form of the platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor in naturally occurring bovine urinary bladder tumours.,"Studies regarding the functions of the bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E5 oncoprotein in vivo are lacking and no E5-mediated mechanism underlying epithelial carcinogenesis is known. We have shown that BPV-2 DNA is present in the majority of naturally occurring urinary bladder tumours of cattle and that E5 is expressed in the cancer cells. Here we show that the interaction between the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta receptor and BPV E5, described in vitro in cultured cells, takes place in vivo in bovine urinary bladder cancers. In these cancers, E5 and PDGF beta receptor colocalize, as shown by confocal microscopy, and physically interact, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the PDGF beta receptor associated with E5 is highly phosphorylated, suggesting the functional activation of the receptor upon E5 interaction. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that E5-PDGF beta receptor interaction occurs during the natural history of bovine urinary bladder tumours, suggesting an important role for E5 in carcinogenesis. Finally, the system provides a suitable animal model of papillomavirus-associated cancer to test therapeutic vaccination against E5. Successful bladder tumour regression would provide a valuable model for therapeutic vaccination against papillomavirus-associated tumours."
17005671,Growth transformation of human T cells by herpesvirus saimiri requires multiple Tip-Lck interaction motifs.,"Lymphoma induction and T-cell transformation by herpesvirus saimiri strain C488 depends on two viral oncoproteins, StpC and Tip. The major interaction partner of Tip is the protein tyrosine kinase Lck, a key regulator of T-cell activation. The Lck binding domain (LBD) of Tip comprises two interaction motifs, a proline-rich SH3 domain-binding sequence (SH3B) and a region with homology to the C terminus of Src family kinase domains (CSKH). In addition, biophysical binding analyses with purified Lck-SH2 domain suggest the phosphorylated tyrosine residue 127 of Tip (pY127) as a potential third Lck interaction site. Here, we addressed the relevance of the individual binding motifs, SH3B, CSKH, and pY127, for Tip-Lck interaction and for human T-cell transformation. Both motifs within the LBD displayed Lck binding activities and cooperated to achieve a highly efficient interaction, while pY127, the major tyrosine phosphorylation site of Tip, did not enhance Lck binding in T cells. Herpesvirus saimiri strain C488 recombinants lacking one or both LBD motifs of Tip lost their transforming potential on human cord blood lymphocytes. Recombinant virus expressing Tip with a mutation at position Y127 was still able to transform human T lymphocytes but, in contrast to wild-type virus, was strictly dependent on exogenous interleukin-2. Thus, the strong Lck binding mediated by cooperation of both LBD motifs was essential for the transformation of human T cells by herpesvirus saimiri C488. The major tyrosine phosphorylation site Y127 of Tip was particularly required for transformation in the absence of exogenous interleukin-2, suggesting its involvement in cytokine signaling pathways."
16311516,The KSHV oncoprotein vFLIP contains a TRAF-interacting motif and requires TRAF2 and TRAF3 for signalling.,"Primary effusion lymphomas (PELs) characterized by infection with the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV; also called human herpesvirus 8) depend on the expression of the viral FADD-like interleukin-1-beta-converting enzyme (FLICE)/caspase-8-inhibitory protein (vFLIP) for their survival. This effect is achieved by activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are direct mediators of NF-kappaB signalling by TNF family receptors and the Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 and so we assessed the role of TRAFs in signalling by vFLIP. Here, we report the identification of a TRAF-interacting motif (PYQLT) in vFLIP, which is not present in other FLIP molecules. We show that vFLIP directly binds to TRAF2 in vitro and in PEL cells. TRAF2 and TRAF3 are required for induction of NF-kappaB and associated cell survival, as well as Jun amino-terminal kinase phosphorylation by vFLIP, whereas TRAF1, TRAF5 and TRAF6 are dispensable. Mutations in the P93 or Q95 amino acids within the TRAF-interacting motif of vFLIP abolish its ability to bind to TRAF2 and to signal to NF-kappaB. TRAF2, but not TRAF3, mediates the association of vFLIP with the IkappaB kinase complex. These data indicate that vFLIP uses TRAF2 and TRAF3 for signalling to NF-kappaB, which is crucial for KSHV-associated lymphomagenesis."
12743606,The adenovirus E1A oncoprotein recruits the cellular TRRAP/GCN5 histone acetyltransferase complex.,"The adenovirus E1A oncoprotein stimulates cell growth and inhibits differentiation by deregulating the normal transcription program via interaction with positive and negative cellular effectors. E1A associates with transcriptional regulatory complexes containing p400 and TRRAP involved in chromatin remodeling and decondensation. TRRAP is a component of three distinct human histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes: the TIP60 complex and complexes containing GCN5 or PCAF. We demonstrate here that E1A binds a TRRAP complex that contains the GCN5 acetyltransferase during a normal adenovirus infection. E1A binds GCN5 and TRRAP in vivo early after virus infection. E1A is associated with significant HAT activity in vitro that is partly attributable to GCN5. E1A represses c-Myc- and E2F-1-directed transcriptional activation in vivo by sequestering GCN5 and/or TRRAP. Our results demonstrate that E1A distinctly binds TRRAP/GCN5, p300/CBP and PCAF HAT complexes. Through interactions with multiple HAT complexes, E1A may deregulate cellular transcription programs and facilitate infection by recruiting functional HAT coactivators to viral and cellular promoter regions."
9881977,Direct suppression of Stat1 function during adenoviral infection.,"The action of adenoviral E1A oncoprotein on host immune-response genes has been attributed to interaction with p300/CBP-type transcriptional coactivators in competition with endogenous transcription factors such as signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. However, we show that mutant forms of E1A that no longer bind p300/CBP can still interact directly with Stat1 (via E1A N-terminal and Stat1 C-terminal residues) and block IFNgamma-driven, Stat1-dependent gene activation and consequent function during early-phase infection in the natural host cell. The results provide a distinct and more specific mechanism for E1A-mediated immune suppression and an alternative model of IFNgamma-driven enhanceosome formation that may allow for other adaptors (in addition to p300/CBP) to link Stat1 to the basal transcription complex."
9687513,E1A directly binds and regulates the P/CAF acetyltransferase.,"The P/CAF protein has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and is capable of binding the transcriptional co-activator CBP. Here we show that P/CAF can regulate transcription and that this function is independent of its binding to CBP. The HAT domain of P/CAF has transcriptional activation potential in yeast. In mammalian cells P/CAF can stimulate transcription of the RSV promoter, using the activity of its HAT domain. We show that the adenovirus protein E1A targets P/CAF and sequesters its transcriptional activity. Binding of E1A to P/CAF is direct, independent of CBP and requires residues within E1A conserved region 1. We find that the P/CAF binding residues in E1A are within a motif shown to be essential for efficient disruption of myogenesis by E1A. The fact that E1A can directly bind and regulate the activity of P/CAF, independently of its regulation of CBP, highlights an important role for P/CAF in the process of cell differentiation."
10523853,The human papilloma virus (HPV)-18 E6 oncoprotein physically associates with Tyk2 and impairs Jak-STAT activation by interferon-alpha.,"We have examined the effects of human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 proteins on interferon (IFN) signaling. Here we show that expression of the 'malignant' HPV-18 E6 in human HT1080 cells results in inhibition of Jak-STAT activation in response to IFN-alpha but not IFN-gamma. This inhibitory effect is not shared by the 'benign' HPV-11 E6. The DNA-binding and transactivation capacities of the transcription factor ISGF3 are diminished in cells expressing HPV-18 E6 after IFN-alpha treatment as a result of decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2, STAT2 and STAT1. However, HPV-18 E6 does not affect the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding of STAT1 by IFN-gamma. In addition, HPV E6 proteins physically interact with Tyk2. This interaction takes place preferably with HPV-18 E6 and to a lesser extent with HPV-11 E6. The E6/Tyk2 interaction requires the JH6-JH7 domains of Tyk2, which are important for Tyk2 binding to the cytoplasmic portion of IFN-alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1). These findings demonstrate an inhibitory role of HPV-18 E6 in the IFN-alpha-induced Jak-STAT pathway, which may be explained, at least in part, by the ability of E6 to interact with and impair Tyk2 activation."
12821782,Human papillomavirus E6 and Myc proteins associate in vivo and bind to and cooperatively activate the telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter.,"The papillomavirus E6 protein binds and directs the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Independent of this p53-degradative function, however, E6 induces cellular telomerase activity. This increase in enzyme activity reflects E6-enhanced transcription of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) catalytic subunit, but the molecular basis for this transactivation is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that E6/Myc interactions regulate hTERT gene expression. Mad protein, a specific antagonist of Myc, repressed E6-mediated transactivation of the hTERT promoter and this repression was relieved by Myc overexpression. The proximal Myc/ Max-binding element (E-box) in the hTERT promoter was the major determinant of both E6 and Myc responsiveness in keratinocytes. E6 did not alter Myc protein expression or Myc/Max association, and the induction of hTERT by Myc/E6 was independent of Myc phosphorylation at Thr-58/Ser-62 within the transactivation domain. However, immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that endogenous Myc protein coprecipitated with E6 protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that both E6 and Myc proteins bound to a minimal 295-bp hTERT promoter. Only the ""high-risk"" E6 proteins bound to the hTERT promoter, consistent with their preferential ability to induce telomerase. The observation that E6 associates with Myc complexes and activates a Myc-responsive gene identifies a mechanism by which this oncogene can modulate cell proliferation and differentiation."
12649209,E1A deregulates the centrosome cycle in a Ran GTPase-dependent manner.,"By means of the yeast two-hybrid system, we have discovered a novel physical interaction between the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein and Ran, a small GTPase which regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport, cell cycle progression, and mitotic spindle organization. Expression of E1A elicits induction of S phase and centrosome amplification in a variety of rodent cell lines. The induction of supernumerary centrosomes requires functional RCC1, the nucleotide exchange factor for Ran and, hence, a functional Ran network. The E1A portion responsible for the interaction with Ran is the extreme NH(2)-terminal region (amino acids 1-36), which is also required for the induction of centrosome amplification. In an in vitro assay with recombinant proteins, wild-type E1A interferes with nucleotide exchange on Ran, whereas an E1A mutant, deleted from the extreme NH(2)-terminal region, does not. In addition, we detected an in vitro interaction between Ran and HPV-16 E7 and SV40 large T antigen, two oncoproteins functionally related to E1A. These findings suggest a common pathway of these oncoproteins in eliciting virus-induced genomic instability."
15767424,"Human papillomavirus type 18 E6 protein binds the cellular PDZ protein TIP-2/GIPC, which is involved in transforming growth factor beta signaling and triggers its degradation by the proteasome.","Several viral proteins expressed by DNA or RNA transforming viruses have the particular property of binding via their C-terminal end to various cellular proteins with PDZ domains. This study is focused on the PDZ protein TIP-2/GIPC, which was originally identified in two-hybrid screens performed with two different baits: the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax oncoprotein and the regulator of G signaling RGS-GAIP. Further studies have shown that TIP-2/GIPC is also able to associate with the cytoplasmic domains of various transmembrane proteins. In this report we show that TIP-2/GIPC interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV-18). This event triggers polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of the cellular protein. In agreement with this observation, silencing of E6 by RNA interference in HeLa cells causes an increase in the intracellular TIP-2/GIPC level. This PDZ protein has been previously found to be involved in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling by favoring expression of the TGF-beta type III receptor at the cell membrane. In line with this activity of TIP-2/GIPC, we observed that depletion of this protein in HeLa cells hampers induction of the Id3 gene by TGF-beta treatment and also diminishes the antiproliferative effect of this cytokine. Conversely, silencing of E6 increases the expression of Id3 and blocks proliferation of HeLa cells. These results support the notion that HPV-18 E6 renders cells less sensitive to the cytostatic effect of TGF-beta by lowering the intracellular amount of TIP-2/GIPC."
12198176,Interference of papillomavirus E6 protein with single-strand break repair by interaction with XRCC1.,"XRCC1 protein is required for the repair of DNA single-strand breaks and genetic stability, and is essential for viability in mammals. XRCC1 functions as a scaffold protein by interacting and modulating polypeptide components of the single-strand break repair machinery, including AP endonuclease-1, DNA ligase IIIalpha, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, DNA polymerase beta and human polynucleotide kinase. We show here that the E6 protein of human papillomavirus type 1, 8 and 16 directly binds XRCC1. When tested in CHO derived XRCC1 'knock out' EM9 cells, co-expression of human papillomavirus 16 E6 with human XRCC1 reduced the ability of the latter protein to correct the methyl methane sulfate sensitivity of XRCC1 mutant CHO cell line EM9. These data identify a novel link between small DNA tumour viruses and DNA repair pathways, and suggest a novel explanation for the development of genomic instability in tissue cells persistently infected with papillomaviruses."
9284049,The human papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein can uncouple cellular differentiation and proliferation in human keratinocytes by abrogating p21Cip1-mediated inhibition of cdk2.,"The high risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated etiologically with the majority of human cervical carcinomas. These HPVs encode two viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, which are expressed consistently in cervical cancers. The function of these viral oncoproteins during a productive infection is to ensure viral replication in cells that have normally withdrawn from the cell division cycle and are committed to terminal differentiation. Expression of the E7 oncoprotein has been shown to lead to the abrogation of various negative growth regulatory signals, including a p53-mediated G1 growth arrest, TGFbeta-mediated growth inhibition, and quiescence of suprabasal keratinocytes. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which E7 can uncouple cellular proliferation and differentiation. In contrast to normal, differentiating keratinocytes, HPV-16 E7-expressing keratinocytes show delayed cellular differentiation and elevated cdk2 kinase activity despite high levels of p21(Cip1) and association of p21(Cip1) with cdk2. We show that the HPV E7 protein can interact with p21(Cip1) and abrogate p21(Cip1)-mediated inhibition of cyclin A and E-associated kinase activities. Based on these findings, we propose that this capacity of the HPV E7 oncoprotein to overcome p21(Cip1)-mediated inhibition of cdk2 activity during keratinocyte differentiation contributes to the ability of E7 to allow for cellular DNA synthesis in differentiated keratinocytes."
12163591,Down regulation of the interleukin-8 promoter by human papillomavirus type 16 E6 and E7 through effects on CREB binding protein/p300 and P/CAF.,"Previously, we reported that human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E6 binds to C/H1, C/H3, and the C-terminal domains of coactivators p300 and CBP, causing the modulation of the transcription of certain genes controlled by NF-kappaB (p65 or relA) and p53. To establish the biological significance of these observations, we have focused on the transcriptional regulation of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a potent chemoattractant for T lymphocytes and neutrophils, which is also essential for the initiation of the local immune response. The IL-8 promoter is regulated by NF-kappaB/p65 in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha and requires the cooperation of the coactivators CBP/p300 and steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) and the p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) for optimal activation. Here we report that, in the presence of HPV-16 E6, the promoter activity of IL-8 was repressed. Moreover, from the mutational analysis of the IL-8 promoter, we found that E6 down-regulates the IL-8 promoter activity through the NF-kappaB/p65 binding site. This inhibition appears to result from the ability of HPV-16 E6 to compete with NF-kappaB/p65 and SRC-1 for binding to the N terminus and C terminus of CBP, respectively. Reporter data also showed that E7 represses IL-8 promoter activity, though to a lesser extent than E6 but, like E6, the repression by E7 is through the NF-kappaB/p65 binding site. E7 was shown for the first time to bind to P/CAF, and the binding was necessary for the down regulation of the IL-8 promoter. E6 and E7 together inhibited transcription of the IL-8 promoter to a greater extent than either alone. Finally, by RNase protection assay, we showed that the synthesis of endogenous IL-8 mRNA was repressed in keratinocytes stably expressing E6 and E7. Taken together, the results provide evidence that E6 and E7 can cooperatively disrupt IL-8 transcription through disruption of transcriptional active complexes, and this may have important consequences for immune responses in infected hosts."
10618715,Interaction between the HPV-16 E2 transcriptional activator and p53.,"The HPV-16 E2 protein is a major regulator of viral DNA replication and gene expression. Through interactions with the viral origin binding protein, E1, it localizes E1 to the origin of replication and stimulates the initiation of viral DNA replication. However, several recent reports have described a number of diverse activities of E2 relating to the induction of apoptosis through both p53 dependent and independent mechanisms, and to induction of growth arrest in both the G1 and G2M phases of the cell cycle. Recent studies have also shown that p53 can specifically inhibit HPV DNA replication, albeit through an unknown mechanism. Since p53 has been described in the replication centres of Herpes Viruses, Adenovirus and SV40 we decided to investigate whether any of the above activities of E2 may be related to an association with p53. We show, in a series of in vitro assays, specific interaction between p53 and HPV-16 E2 via residues in the carboxy terminal half of the E2 protein. Mutational analysis of p53 indicates that sequences in both the DNA binding and oligomerization domains are essential for the interaction, and a mutant of p53 which is unable to bind E2 is also unable to inhibit HPV DNA replication. Finally, using an inducible system of p53 expression we also show that E2 will complex with p53 in vivo. These results raise the intriguing possibility that p53 may also be involved in HPV DNA replication centres, and also provides explanations for some of the diverse activities reported for the HPV E2 proteins."
10082529,Synergism with germ line transcription factor Oct-4: viral oncoproteins share the ability to mimic a stem cell-specific activity.,"Activation of transcription by Oct-4 from remote binding sites requires a cofactor that is restricted to embryonal stem cells. The adenovirus E1A protein can mimic the activity of this stem cell-specific factor and stimulates Oct-4 activity in differentiated cells. Here we characterize the Oct-4-E1A interaction and show that the E1A 289R protein harbors two independent Oct-4 binding sites, both of which specifically interact with the POU domain of Oct-4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, like E1A, the human papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein also specifically binds to the Oct-4 POU domain. E7 and Oct-4 can form a complex both in vitro and in vivo. Expression of E7 in differentiated cells stimulates Oct-4-mediated transactivation from distal binding sites. Moreover, Oct-4, but not other Oct factors, is active when expressed in cells transformed by human papillomavirus. Our results suggest that different viruses have evolved oncoproteins that share the ability to target Oct-4 and to mimic a stem cell-specific activity."
12692227,The Papillomavirus E2 protein binds to and synergizes with C/EBP factors involved in keratinocyte differentiation.,"The papillomavirus life cycle is closely linked to the differentiation program of the host keratinocyte. Thus, late gene expression and viral maturation are restricted to terminally differentiated keratinocytes. A variety of cellular transcription factors including those of the C/EBP family are involved in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation. In this study we show that the papillomavirus transcription factor E2 cooperates with C/EBPalpha and -beta in transcriptional activation. This synergism was independent of an E2 binding site. E2 and C/EBP factors synergistically transactivated a synthetic promoter construct containing classical C/EBPbeta sites and the C/EBPalpha-responsive proximal promoter of the involucrin gene, which is naturally expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. C/EBPalpha or -beta coprecipitated with E2 proteins derived from human papillomavirus type 8 (HPV8), HPV16, HPV18, and bovine papillomavirus type 1 in vitro and in vivo, indicating complex formation by the cellular and viral factors. The interaction domains could be mapped to the C terminus of E2 and amino acids 261 to 302 located within the bZIP motif of C/EBPbeta. Our data suggest that E2, via its interaction with C/EBP factors, may contribute to enhancing keratinocyte differentiation, which is suppressed by the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 in HPV-induced lesions."
17932485,"De novo replication of the influenza virus RNA genome is regulated by DNA replicative helicase, MCM.","By dissecting and reconstituting a cell-free influenza virus genome replication system, we have purified and identified the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, which is thought to be a DNA replicative helicase, as one of the host factors that regulate the virus genome replication. MCM interacted with the PA subunit of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is found to be involved in the replication genetically. The virus genome replication was decreased in MCM2 knockdown cells. The viral polymerase appeared to be a nonproductive complex, that is, it was capable of initiating replication but produced only abortive short RNA chains. MCM stimulated de novo-initiated replication reaction by stabilizing a replication complex during its transition from initiation to elongation. Based on the findings, including the result that the MCM-mediated RNA replication reaction was competed with exogenously added RNA, we propose that MCM functions as a scaffold between the nascent RNA chains and the viral polymerase."
17602943,Physical and functional interaction between a nucleolar protein nucleophosmin/B23 and adenovirus basic core proteins.,"We identified nucleophosmin/B23 as a component of template-activating factor-III that stimulates the DNA replication from the adenovirus DNA complexed with viral basic core proteins. Here, we have studied the functional interaction of B23 with viral core proteins. We found that B23 interacts with viral basic core proteins, core protein V and precursor of core protein VII (pre-VII), in infected cells. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that B23 suppresses formation of aggregates between DNA and core proteins and transfers pre-VII to DNA. These results indicate that B23 functions as a chaperone in the viral chromatin assembly process in infected cells."
7565739,Adenovirus E1A functions as a cofactor for retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR beta) through direct interaction with RAR beta.,"Transcription regulation by DNA-bound activators is thought to be mediated by a direct interaction between these proteins and TATA-binding protein (TBP), TFIIB, or TBP-associated factors, although occasionally cofactors or adapters are required. For ligand-induced activation by the retinoic acid receptor-retinoid X receptor (RAR-RXR) heterodimer, the RAR beta 2 promoter is dependent on the presence of E1A or E1A-like activity, since this promoter is activated by retinoic acid only in cells expressing such proteins. The mechanism underlying this E1A requirement is largely unknown. We now show that direct interaction between RAR and E1A is a requirement for retinoic acid-induced RAR beta 2 activation. The activity of the hormone-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2) of RAR beta is upregulated by E1A, and an interaction between this region and E1A was observed, but not with AF-1 or AF-2 of RXR alpha. This interaction is dependent on conserved region III (CRIII), the 13S mRNA-specific region of E1A. Deletion analysis within this region indicated that the complete CRIII is needed for activation. The putative zinc finger region is crucial, probably as a consequence of interaction with TBP. Furthermore, the region surrounding amino acid 178, partially overlapping with the TBP binding region, is involved in both binding to and activation by AF-2. We propose that E1A functions as a cofactor by interacting with both TBP and RAR, thereby stabilizing the preinitiation complex."
16940534,Hepatitis C virus core protein blocks interferon signaling by interaction with the STAT1 SH2 domain.,"Emerging data have indicated that hepatitis C virus (HCV) subverts the host antiviral response to ensure its persistence. We previously demonstrated that HCV protein expression suppresses type I interferon (IFN) signaling by leading to the reduction of phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1). We also demonstrated that HCV core protein directly bound to STAT1. However, the detailed mechanisms by which HCV core protein impacts IFN signaling components have not been fully clarified. In this report, we show that the STAT1 interaction domain resides in the N-terminal portion of HCV core (amino acids [aa] 1 to 23). This domain is also required to produce P-STAT1 reduction and inhibit IFN signaling transduction. Conversely, the C-terminal region of STAT1, specifically the SH2 domain (aa 577 to 684), is required for the interaction of HCV core with STAT1. The STAT1 SH2 domain is critical for STAT1 hetero- or homodimerization. We propose a model by which the binding of HCV core to STAT1 results in decreased P-STAT, blocked STAT1 heterodimerization to STAT2, and, therefore, reduced IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 binding to DNA and disrupted IFN-stimulated gene transcription."
17022977,Identification of Hsc70 as an influenza virus matrix protein (M1) binding factor involved in the virus life cycle.,"Influenza virus matrix protein 1 (M1) has been shown to play a crucial role in the virus replication, assembly and budding. We identified heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) as a M1 binding protein by immunoprecipitation and MALDI-TOF MS. The C terminal domain of M1 interacts with Hsc70. We found that Hsc70 does not correlate with the transport of M1 to the nucleus, however, it does inhibit the nuclear export of M1 and NP, thus resulting in the inhibition of viral production. This is the first demonstration that Hsc70 is directly associated with M1 and therefore is required for viral production."
18519040,Isoform-specific interaction of pyruvate kinase with hepatitis C virus NS5B.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and pathogenesis involve both virus-encoded proteins and cellular factors. In our study, we showed that NS5B, the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, interacted with M2 type pyruvate kinase (M2PK) but not L type pyruvate kinase. We confirmed the interaction by GST pull down, coimmunoprecipitation and confocal immunofluorescence analysis in cells with transient expression of NS5B and M2PK as well as in a HCV replicon-bearing cell line. Furthermore shRNA which specifically down-regulated M2PK expression could inhibit the replication of HCV in HCV replicon 9B cells."
10958676,Role of the LXCXE binding site in Rb function.,"Oncoproteins from DNA tumor viruses such as adenovirus E1a, simian virus 40 T antigen, and human papillomavirus E7 contain an LXCXE sequence, which they use to bind the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and inhibit its function. Cellular proteins such as histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and -2) also contain an LXCXE-like sequence, which they use to interact with Rb. The LXCXE binding site in Rb was mutated to assess its role in Rb function. These mutations inhibited binding to HDAC1 and -2, which each contain an LXCXE-like sequence, but had no effect on binding to HDAC3, which lacks an LXCXE-like sequence. Mutation of the LXCXE binding site inhibited active transcriptional repression by Rb and prevented it from effectively repressing the cyclin E and A gene promoters. In contrast, mutations in the LXCXE binding site did not prevent Rb from binding and inactivating E2F. Thus, the LXCXE mutations appear to separate Rb's ability to bind and inactivate E2F from its ability to efficiently recruit HDAC1 and -2 and actively repress transcription. In transient assays, several of the LXCXE binding site mutants caused an increase in the percentage of cells in G(1) by flow cytometry, suggesting that they can arrest cells. However, this effect was transient, as none of the mutants affected cell proliferation in longer-term assays examining bromodeoxyuridine incorporation or colony formation. Our results then suggest that the LXCXE binding site is important for full Rb function. Mutation of the LXCXE binding site does not inhibit binding of the BRG1 ATPase component of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex, which has been shown previously to be important for Rb function. Indeed, overexpression of BRG1 and Rb in cells deficient for the proteins led to stable growth inhibition, suggesting a cooperative role for SWI/SNF and the LXCXE binding site in efficient Rb function."
10074103,"EBP2, a human protein that interacts with sequences of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 important for plasmid maintenance.","The replication and stable maintenance of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA episomes in human cells requires only one viral protein, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1). To gain insight into the mechanisms by which EBNA1 functions, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to detect human proteins that interact with EBNA1. We describe here the isolation of a protein, EBP2 (EBNA1 binding protein 2), that specifically interacts with EBNA1. EBP2 was also shown to bind to DNA-bound EBNA1 in a one-hybrid system, and the EBP2-EBNA1 interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation from insect cells expressing these two proteins. EBP2 is a 35-kDa protein that is conserved in a variety of organisms and is predicted to form coiled-coil interactions. We have mapped the region of EBNA1 that binds EBP2 and generated internal deletion mutants of EBNA1 that are deficient in EBP2 interactions. Functional analyses of these EBNA1 mutants show that the ability to bind EBP2 correlates with the ability of EBNA1 to support the long-term maintenance in human cells of a plasmid containing the EBV origin, oriP. An EBNA1 mutant lacking amino acids 325 to 376 was defective for EBP2 binding and long-term oriP plasmid maintenance but supported the transient replication of oriP plasmids at wild-type levels. Thus, our results suggest that the EBNA1-EBP2 interaction is important for the stable segregation of EBV episomes during cell division but not for the replication of the episomes."
2211726,Protein-protein interactions between adenovirus DNA polymerase and nuclear factor I mediate formation of the DNA replication preinitiation complex.,"The in vitro adenovirus (Ad) DNA replication system provides an assay to study the interaction of viral and host replication proteins with the DNA template in the formation of the preinitiation complex. This initiation system requires in addition to the origin DNA sequences 1) Ad DNA polymerase (Pol), 2) Ad preterminal protein (pTP), the covalent acceptor for protein-primed DNA replication, and 3) nuclear factor I (NFI), a host cell protein identical to the CCAAT box-binding transcription factor. The interactions of these proteins were studied by coimmunoprecipitation and Ad origin DNA binding assays. The Ad Pol can bind to origin sequences only in the presence of another protein which can be either pTP or NFI. While NFI alone can bind to its origin recognition sequence, pTP does not specifically recognize DNA unless Ad Pol is present. Thus, protein-protein interactions are necessary for the targetting of either Ad Pol or pTP to the preinitiation complex. DNA footprinting demonstrated that the Ad DNA site recognized by the pTP.Pol complex was within the first 18 bases at the end of the template which constitutes the minimal origin of replication. Mutagenesis studies have defined the Ad Pol interaction site on NFI between amino acids 68-150, which overlaps the DNA binding and replication activation domain of this factor. A putative zinc finger on the Ad Pol has been mutated to a product that fails to bind the Ad origin sequences but still interacts with pTP. These results indicate that both protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions mediate specific recognition of the replication origin by Ad DNA polymerase."
11733528,The conserved Mynd domain of BS69 binds cellular and oncoviral proteins through a common PXLXP motif.,"BS69 is a transcriptional co-repressor protein and a potential tumor suppressor that binds to the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A. We show that the C-terminal Mynd domain of BS69 (amino acids 516-561) or the closely related Mynd domains of the Caenorhabditis elegans proteins Bra-1 and Bra-2 bind not only to E1A but also to the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA2 oncoprotein and the Myc-related cellular protein MGA. Interaction depends on intact PXLXP motifs present in all three proteins. Moreover, viral proteins compete for binding of BS69 to MGA in a PXLXP-dependent fashion. Because deletions in E1A or EBNA2 that cover the PXLXP motifs are non-transforming, our observations suggest a role for BS69 in cell growth control that is reminiscent of abrogation of the Rb function by various oncoproteins."
16140784,"The 41-amino-acid C-terminal region of the hepatitis E virus ORF3 protein interacts with bikunin, a kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor.","Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a human plus-stranded RNA virus, contains three open reading frames (ORF). Of these, ORF1 encodes the viral nonstructural polyprotein, ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein, and ORF3 codes for a phosphoprotein of undefined function. Recently, using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human cDNA liver library, we have isolated and characterized AMBP (alpha1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor), which specifically interacts with the ORF3 protein of HEV. The ORF3 protein expedites the processing and secretion of alpha1-microglobulin. When checked individually for interaction, the second processed protein from AMBP, bikunin, strongly interacted with the full-length ORF3 protein. This protein-protein interaction has been validated by immunoprecipitation in both COS-1 and Huh7 cells and by His6 pull-down assays. In dual-labeling immunofluorescent staining, followed by fluorescence microscopy of transfected human liver cells, ORF3 colocalized with endogenously expressed bikunin. Finally, a 41-amino-acid C-terminal region of ORF3 has been found to be responsible for interacting with bikunin. The importance of this virus-host protein-protein interaction, with reference to the viral life cycle, has been discussed."
9881696,Inhibition of Bak-induced apoptosis by HPV-18 E6.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 proteins inhibit apoptosis in both p53-dependent and p53-independent manners. A key point in apoptosis is the regulation provided by the Bcl-2 family; and in differentiating keratinocytes, in which HPV replicates, the Bak protein is highly expressed. We show that HPV-18 E6 will inhibit Bak-induced apoptosis and this is mediated by an interaction between the E6 and Bak proteins resulting in degradation of the Bak protein in vivo. We also show that Bak protein interacts with the ubiquitin ligase, E6AP, and that a mutant of Bak defective in E6AP binding is overexpressed in comparison with wild type. These studies suggest that Bak is probably the first naturally occurring target of E6AP to be identified."
10365963,Interaction of E1 and hSNF5 proteins stimulates replication of human papillomavirus DNA.,"Mammalian viruses often use components of the host's cellular DNA replication machinery to carry out replication of their genomes, which enables these viruses to be used as tools for characterizing factors that are involved in cellular DNA replication. The human papillomavirus (HPV) E1 protein is essential for replication of the virus DNA. Here we identify the cellular factor that participates in viral DNA replication by using a two-hybrid assay in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E1 protein as bait. Using this assay, we isolated Inil/hSNF5, a component of the SWI/SNF complex which facilitates transcription by altering the structure of chromatin. In vitro binding and immunoprecipitation confirmed that E1 interacts directly with Ini1/hSNF5. Transient DNA-replication assay revealed that HPV DNA replication is stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by addition of Ini1/hSNF5, and that Ini1/hSNF5 antisense RNA blocks the replication of HPV DNA. Amino-acid substitution at residues that are conserved among E1 proteins prevented the E1-Ini1/hSNF5 interaction and reduced DNA replication of HPV in vivo. Our results indicate that Ini1/hSNF5 is required for the efficient replication of papillomavirus DNA and is therefore needed, either alone or in complex with SWI/SNF complex, for mammalian DNA replication as well."
8617242,The human papillomavirus type 16 E7 gene product interacts with and trans-activates the AP1 family of transcription factors.,"The E7 gene product of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) binds to the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) and dissociates pRb-E2F complexes. However, the observation that the ability of E7 to bind pRb is not required for the HPV16-induced immortalization of primary keratinocytes prompted a search for other cellular factors bound by E7. Using a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein system, we show that E7 complexes with AP1 transcription factors including c-Jun, JunB, JunD and c-Fos. The ability of E7 to complex with c-Jun in vivo is demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and the yeast two-hybrid system. An analysis of E7 point mutants in the GST system indicates that the E7 zinc-finger motif, but not the pRb binding domain, is involved in these interactions. Using c-Jun deletion mutants, E7 binding maps between amino acids 224 and 286 of c-Jun. E7 trans-activates c-Jun-induced transcription from a Jun responsive promoter, and this activity correlates with the ability of E7 mutants to bind Jun proteins. Finally, a transcriptionally inactive c-Jun deletion, which can bind E7, interferes with the E7-induced transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts in cooperation with an activated ras, indicating that the Jun-E7 interaction is physiologically relevant and that Jun factors may be targeted in the E7 transformation pathway."
12970734,Interaction between the HPV E7 oncoprotein and the transcriptional coactivator p300.,"Infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) can lead to the development of cervical cancer. This process depends on the interaction of the virus-encoded oncoproteins, E6 and E7, with a variety of host regulatory proteins. As E7 shares both functional and structural similarities with the Adenovirus E1a (Ad E1a) protein, we were interested in investigating the possible interactions between E7 and the transcriptional coactivator p300, since it was originally identified as a target of Ad E1a. Using a variety of assays, we show that E7s from both high- and low-risk HPV types interact with p300. Mutational analysis of E7 maps the site of the interaction to a region spanning the pRb-binding domain and the CKII phosphorylation site. We also map the site of interaction on p300 largely to the CH1 domain. In addition, we demonstrate that the binding between 16E7 and p300 is direct, and can be detected in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assays. Finally, we show that E7 can abolish the p300-mediated E2 transactivation function, suggesting that complex formation between E7 and p300 may contribute to the regulation of E2 transcriptional activity."
14557665,Adenovirus E1B 55-kilodalton oncoprotein binds to Daxx and eliminates enhancement of p53-dependent transcription by Daxx.,"The adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein impairs the p53 pathway and enhances transformation, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be defined. We found that Daxx binds to the E1B 55-kDa protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The two proteins interact through their C termini. Mutation of three potential phosphorylation sites (S489/490 and T494 to alanine) within the E1B 55-kDa protein did not affect its interaction with Daxx, although such mutations were previously shown to inhibit E1B's ability to repress p53-dependent transcription and to enhance transformation. In addition to their coimmunoprecipitation in 293 extracts, purified Daxx interacted with the E1B 55-kDa protein in vitro, indicating their direct interaction. In 293 cells, Daxx colocalized with the E1B 55-kDa protein within discrete nuclear dots, where p53 was also found. Such structures were distinct from PML (promyelocytic leukemia protein) bodies, and it appeared that Daxx was displaced from PML bodies. Thus, the Daxx concentration was diminished in dots with a prominent presence of PML and vice versa. Indeed, PML overexpression led to dramatic redistribution of Daxx from p53-E1B 55-kDa protein complexes to PML bodies. Additionally, expression of the E1B 55-kDa protein in Saos2 osteosarcoma cells reduced the number of PML bodies. Our data suggest that E1B and PML compete for available Daxx in the cell. Surprisingly, Daxx significantly augmented p53-mediated transcription and the E1B 55-kDa protein eliminated this effect. Thus, it is likely that the E1B 55-kDa protein sequesters Daxx and p53 in specific nuclear locations, where p53 cannot activate transcription. One consequence of the Daxx-E1B interaction might be an alteration of normal interactions of Daxx, PML, and p53, which may contribute to cell transformation."
10734313,The adenovirus E1A binding protein BS69 is a corepressor of transcription through recruitment of N-CoR.,"BS69 was first identified as a protein that interacts directly with the transactivation domain (conserved region 3) of the 289R adenovirus type 5 E1A protein. We show here that BS69 is a potent repressor of transcription. BS69 mediates repression, at least in part, through interaction with the co-repressor N-CoR. BS69 interacts with N-CoR through a MYND domain in its carboxyl terminus. A recently cloned splice variant of BS69, designated BRAM1, is also capable of interacting with N-CoR and E1A, but unlike BS69, is not able to repress transcription, indicating that N-CoR interaction is necessary but not sufficient for BS69 repression. Expression of E1A inhibits repression mediated by BS69. Our data suggest that BS69 participates in transcriptional repressor complexes and that E1A can modulate these complexes through interaction with BS69."
10722738,"cAMP-independent activation of the adenovirus type 12 E2 promoter correlates with the recruitment of CREB-1/ATF-1, E1A(12S), and CBP to the E2-CRE.","Expression of the transcription unit early region 2 (E2) is of crucial importance for adenoviruses because this region encodes proteins essential for viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that the E1A(12S) protein of the oncogenic adenovirus serotype 12 activates the E2 promoter in dependence of the N terminus and the conserved region 1. Activation is mediated through a cAMP-response element that is bound by CREB-1 and ATF-1. Moreover, the Ad12 E2 promoter is inducible by protein kinase A and repressed by either a dominant-negative cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) mutant or the highly specific protein kinase A inhibitor protein underscoring the participation of CREB-1/ATF-1 in promoter activation. E1A(12S) binds to CREB-1 and ATF-1 in dependence of the N terminus and CR1 and is recruited to the E2 cAMP-response element through both cellular transcription factors. Most interestingly, point mutations revealed that E1A(12S) domains essential for binding to CREB-1/ATF-1 and for activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter are also essential for binding to the CREB-binding protein. Due to these data and results obtained in DNA-dependent protein-protein interaction assays, we propose a model in which the cAMP-independent activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter is mediated through a ternary complex consisting of CREB-1/ATF-1, E1A(12S), and CREB-binding protein, which assembles on the E2 cAMP-response element."
16763564,Roles for APIS and the 20S proteasome in adenovirus E1A-dependent transcription.,"We have determined distinct roles for different proteasome complexes in adenovirus (Ad) E1A-dependent transcription. We show that the 19S ATPase, S8, as a component of 19S ATPase proteins independent of 20S (APIS), binds specifically to the E1A transactivation domain, conserved region 3 (CR3). Recruitment of APIS to CR3 enhances the ability of E1A to stimulate transcription from viral early gene promoters during Ad infection of human cells. The ability of CR3 to stimulate transcription in yeast is similarly dependent on the functional integrity of yeast APIS components, Sug1 and Sug2. The 20S proteasome is also recruited to CR3 independently of APIS and the 26S proteasome. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that E1A, S8 and the 20S proteasome are recruited to both Ad early region gene promoters and early region gene sequences during Ad infection, suggesting their requirement in both transcriptional initiation and elongation. We also demonstrate that E1A CR3 transactivation and degradation sequences functionally overlap and that proteasome inhibitors repress E1A transcription. Taken together, these data demonstrate distinct roles for APIS and the 20S proteasome in E1A-dependent transactivation."
16799465,ORC binding to TRF2 stimulates OriP replication.,"In higher eukaryotes, the origin recognition complex (ORC) lacks sequence-specific DNA binding, and it remains unclear what other factors specify an origin of DNA replication. The Epstein-Barr virus origin of plasmid replication (OriP) recruits ORC, but the precise mechanism of ORC recruitment and origin activation is not clear. We now show that ORC is recruited selectively to the dyad symmetry (DS) region of OriP as a consequence of direct interactions with telomere repeat factor 2 (TRF2) and ORC1. TRF-binding sites within DS stimulate replication initiation and facilitate ORC recruitment in vitro and in vivo. TRF2, but not TRF1 or hRap1, recruits ORC from nuclear extracts. The amino-terminal domain of TRF2 associated with a specific region of ORC1 and was necessary for stimulation of DNA replication. These results support a model in which TRF2 stimulates OriP replication activity by direct binding with ORC subunits."
18647839,D-retrovirus morphogenetic switch driven by the targeting signal accessibility to Tctex-1 of dynein.,"Despite extensive data demonstrating that immature retroviral particle assembly can take place either at the plasma membrane or at a distinct location within the cytoplasm, targeting of viral precursor proteins to either assembly site still remains poorly understood. Biochemical data presented here suggest that Tctex-1, a light chain of the molecular motor dynein, is involved in the intracellular targeting of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) polyproteins to the cytoplasmic assembly site. Comparison of the three-dimensional structures of M-PMV wild-type matrix protein (wt MA) with a single amino acid mutant (R55F), which redirects assembly from a cytoplasmic site to the plasma membrane, revealed different mutual orientations of their C- and N-terminal domains. This conformational change buries a putative intracellular targeting motif located between both domains in the hydrophobic pocket of the MA molecule, thereby preventing the interaction with cellular transport mechanisms."
10523841,Interaction of the fork head domain transcription factor MPP2 with the human papilloma virus 16 E7 protein: enhancement of transformation and transactivation.,"The high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E7 protein affects cell growth control and promotes transformation by interfering with functions of cellular proteins. A key target of E7 is the tumor suppressor protein p105RB. Although this interaction is required for E7-dependent transformation, other cellular molecules must also be involved, because some E7 mutants that have reduced transforming abilities still bind to p105RB. In order to identify additional proteins that interact with E7 and that may be responsible to mediate its transforming function, we have used the C-terminal half of E7 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. We identified the fork head domain transcription factor M phase phosphoprotein 2 (MPP2) as an interaction partner of E7. Specific interaction of the two proteins both in vitro and in vivo in mammalian cells was detected. The interaction of MPP2 with E7 is functionally relevant since MPP2 enhances the E7/Ha-Ras co-transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts. In addition HPV16 E7, but neither non-transforming mutants of HPV16 E7 nor low risk HPV6 E7, was able to stimulate MPP2-specific transcriptional activity. Thus, MPP2 is a potentially important target for E7-mediated transformation."
11414803,Binding of PKA-RIIalpha to the Adenovirus E1A12S oncoprotein correlates with its nuclear translocation and an increase in PKA-dependent promoter activity.,"The adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) E1A12S oncoprotein utilizes the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathway to activate expression of the viral E2 gene, the products of which are essential for viral replication. A central unsolved question is, however, whether E1A12S interacts directly with PKA in the process of promoter activation. We show here that E1A12S binds to the regulatory subunits (R) of PKA in vitro and in vivo. Interaction depends on the N-terminus and the conserved region 1 (CR1) of E1A12S. Both domains are also essential for the activation of viral E2 gene expression. Infection of cells with Ad12 leads to the cellular redistribution of RIIalpha from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Furthermore, RIIalpha is also located in the nucleus of cells transformed by E1 of Ad12 and transient expression of E1A12S leads to the redistribution of RIIalpha into the nucleus in a N-terminus- and CR1-dependent manner. Cotransfection of E1A12S with RIIalpha results in strong activation of the E2 promoter. Based on these results we conclude that E1A12S functions as a viral A-kinase anchoring protein redistributing RIIalpha from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it is involved in E1A12S-mediated activation of the E2 promoter."
17314511,Large-scale identification of c-MYC-associated proteins using a combined TAP/MudPIT approach.,"The c-MYC oncogene encodes a transcription factor, which is sufficient and necessary for the induction of cellular proliferation. However, the c-MYC protein is a relatively weak transactivator suggesting that it may have other functions. To identify protein interactors which may reveal new functions or represent regulators of c-MYC we systematically identified proteins associated with c-MYC in vivo using a proteomic approach. We combined tandem affinity purification (TAP) with the mass spectral multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT). Thereby, 221 c-MYC-associated proteins were identified. Among them were 17 previously known c-MYC-interactors. Selected new c-MYC-associated proteins (DBC-1, FBX29, KU70, MCM7, Mi2-beta/CHD4, RNA Pol II, RFC2, RFC3, SV40 Large T Antigen, TCP1alpha, U5-116kD, ZNF281) were confirmed independently. For association with MCM7, SV40 Large T Antigen and DBC-1 the functionally important MYC-box II region was required, whereas FBX29 and Mi2-beta interacted via MYC-box II and the BR-HLH-LZ motif. In addition, regulators of c-MYC activity were identified: ectopic expression of FBX29, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, decreased c-MYC protein levels and inhibited c-MYC transactivation, whereas knock-down of FBX29 elevated the concentration of c-MYC. Furthermore, sucrose gradient analysis demonstrated that c-MYC is present in numerous complexes with varying size and composition, which may accommodate the large number of new c-MYC-associated proteins identified here and mediate the diverse functions of c-MYC. Our results suggest that c-MYC, besides acting as a mitogenic transcription factor, regulates cellular proliferation by direct association with protein complexes involved in multiple synthetic processes required for cell division, as for example DNA-replication/repair and RNA-processing. Furthermore, this first comprehensive description of the c-MYC-associated sub-proteome will facilitate further studies aimed to elucidate the biology of c-MYC."
17719540,"A bacterial effector targets Mad2L2, an APC inhibitor, to modulate host cell cycling.","The gut epithelium self-renews every several days, providing an important innate defense system that limits bacterial colonization. Nevertheless, many bacterial pathogens, including Shigella, efficiently colonize the intestinal epithelium. Here, we show that the Shigella effector IpaB, when delivered into epithelial cells, causes cell-cycle arrest by targeting Mad2L2, an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC) inhibitor. Cyclin B1 ubiquitination assays revealed that APC undergoes unscheduled activation due to IpaB interaction with the APC inhibitor Mad2L2. Synchronized HeLa cells infected with Shigella failed to accumulate Cyclin B1, Cdc20, and Plk1, causing cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in an IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent manner. IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent cell-cycle arrest by Shigella infection was also demonstrated in rabbit intestinal crypt progenitors, and the IpaB-mediated arrest contributed to efficient colonization of the host cells. These results strongly indicate that Shigella employ special tactics to influence epithelial renewal in order to promote bacterial colonization of intestinal epithelium."
11878923,Hepatitis C virus NS5A colocalizes with the core protein on lipid droplets and interacts with apolipoproteins.,"The nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to interact with a variety of cellular proteins and implicated in the regulation of cell growth, interferon resistance, and other cellular signaling pathways, but the role of NS5A in HCV pathogenesis has not been firmly established. To further characterize this multifunctional protein, we instigated the studies of the subcellular localization of NS5A in a hepatoma cell line. NS5A was localized to the perinuclear membrane structures, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. In addition, it was also associated with the surface of cytoplasmic globular structures when expressed alone or as a part of the NS3-5B polyprotein. Oil red O staining revealed that these globular structures were lipid droplets, where the HCV core protein was also localized. The association of NS5A with intracellular membrane was further confirmed by membrane flotation analysis. To determine whether NS5A interacts with any cellular lipid-binding protein, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening in both HepG2 and human liver cDNA libraries. Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), one of the protein components of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, was identified by two independent screening processes. The interaction between NS5A and apoA1 was confirmed by both in vitro pull-down and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Immunofluorescence staining revealed a significant colocalization of NS5A and apoA1 in the Golgi apparatus. Our results established an association of NS5A with lipid droplets and apoA1, suggesting that NS5A, together with the core protein, may play a role in the pathogenesis of the derangement of lipid metabolism, contributing to liver steatosis commonly observed in hepatitis C."
9651361,Hepatitis C virus core protein interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein, a component of viral nucleocapsid, has been shown to modulate cellular and viral promoter activities. To identify potential cellular targets for HCV core protein, a human liver cDNA library was screened for core-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. Among the proteins identified was heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), which has been demonstrated to be a transcriptional regulator. The interaction of HCV core protein with hnRNP K was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase fusion protein binding assay, protein-protein blotting assay, and coimmunoprecipitation in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, these two proteins were shown to be partially colocalized in the nucleus. The hnRNP K-binding site in HCV core protein was mapped to the region from amino acid residues 25-91, a hydrophilic area near the N terminus. The HCV core protein-binding domain was located within amino acid residues 250 to 392, which contain the three proline-rich domains, of hnRNP K. Furthermore, HCV core protein relieved the suppression effect of hnRNP K on the activity of the human thymidine kinase gene promoter. The specific binding of HCV core protein to hnRNP K suggests that multiple functions of hnRNP K may be disrupted by the core protein during HCV infection and thus explains, in part, the pathogenesis of HCV."
15848177,Sumoylation of the nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes a highly basic nucleocapsid (N) protein of 422 amino acids. Similar to other coronavirus N proteins, SARS-CoV N protein is predicted to be phosphorylated and may contain nuclear localization signals, serine/arginine-rich motif, RNA binding domain and regions responsible for self-association and homo-oligomerization. In this study, we demonstrate that the protein is posttranslationally modified by covalent attachment to the small ubiquitin-like modifier. The major sumoylation site was mapped to the (62)lysine residue of the N protein. Further expression and characterization of wild type N protein and K62A mutant reveal that sumoylation of the N protein drastically promotes its homo-oligomerization, and plays certain roles in the N protein-mediated interference of host cell division. This is the first report showing that a coronavirus N protein undergoes posttranslational modification by sumoylation, and the functional implication of this modification in the formation of coronavirus ribouncleoprotein complex, virion assembly and virus-host interactions."
14966293,Direct interaction between nucleosome assembly protein 1 and the papillomavirus E2 proteins involved in activation of transcription.,"Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified human nucleosome assembly protein 1 (hNAP-1) as a protein interacting with the activation domain of the transcriptional activator encoded by papillomaviruses (PVs), the E2 protein. We show that the interaction between E2 and hNAP-1 is direct and not merely mediated by the transcriptional coactivator p300, which is bound by both proteins. Coexpression of hNAP-1 strongly enhances activation by E2, indicating a functional interaction as well. E2 binds to at least two separate domains within hNAP-1, one within the C terminus and an internal domain. The binding of E2 to hNAP-1 is necessary for cooperativity between the factors. Moreover, the N-terminal 91 amino acids are crucial for the transcriptional activity of hNAP-1, since deletion mutants lacking this N-terminal portion fail to cooperate with E2. We provide evidence that hNAP-1, E2, and p300 can form a ternary complex efficient in the activation of transcription. We also show that p53 directly interacts with hNAP-1, indicating that transcriptional activators in addition to PV E2 interact with hNAP-1. These results suggest that the binding of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins to hNAP-1 may be an important step contributing to the activation of transcription."
10871618,Bovine papillomavirus E1 protein is sumoylated by the host cell Ubc9 protein.,"Papillomavirus E1 protein is the replication initiator that recognizes and binds to the viral origin and initiates DNA strand separation through its ATP-dependent helicase activity. The E1 protein also functions in viral DNA replication by recruiting several cellular proteins to the origin, including host DNA polymerase alpha and replication protein A. To identify other cellular proteins that interact with bovine papillomavirus E1, an HeLa cDNA library was screened using a yeast two-hybrid assay. The host cell sumoylating enzyme, Ubc9, was found to interact specifically with E1 both in vitro and in vivo. Mapping studies localized critical E1 sequences for interaction to amino acids 315-459 and strongly implicated leucine 420 as critical for E1.Ubc9 complex formation. In addition to binding E1, Ubc9 catalyzed the covalent linkage of the ubiquitin-like protein, SUMO-1, to E1. An E1 mutant unable to bind Ubc9 showed normal intracellular stability, but was impaired for intranuclear distribution. Failure to accumulate in appropriate nuclear subdomains may account for the previously demonstrated replication defect of a human papillomavirus 16 E1 protein that was also unable to bind Ubc9 and suggests that sumoylation is a functionally important modification with regulatory implications for papillomavirus replication."
15527772,The carboxy-terminus of the hepatitis B virus X protein is necessary and sufficient for the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) of the hepatitis B virus is strongly implicated in angiogenesis and metastasis during hepatocarcinogenesis. Previously, we reported that HBx enhances activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a potent transactivator that induces angiogenic factors. Here, we delineate the structural region of HBx that potentiates HIF-1alpha. The carboxy-terminus of HBx increased the stability of HIF-1alpha protein, probably through inhibiting interaction with von Hippel-Lindau protein. Further, the carboxy-terminus of HBx enhanced the transactivation function of HIF-1alpha by enhancing its association with CREB binding protein (CBP). Finally, we demonstrated the physical association of HBx with the basic helix-loop-helix/PER-ARNT-SIM domain, the inhibitory domain, and the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-1alpha in vivo."
16932746,The UL144 gene product of human cytomegalovirus activates NFkappaB via a TRAF6-dependent mechanism.,"Molecular mimicry of cytokines and cytokine receptors is a strategy used by poxviruses and herpesviruses to modulate host immunity. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL144 gene, situated in the UL/b' region of the viral genome, has amino-acid sequence similarity to members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily. We report that UL144 is a potent activator of NFkappaB-induced transcription in a TRAF6-dependent manner. This NFkappaB activation enhances expression of the chemokine CCL22 through the NFkappaB responsive elements found in its promoter. In contrast to the clinical HCMV isolates, extensively passaged laboratory strains lack the UL/b' region and hence do not encode UL144. Consistent with this, infection with viruses that carry UL/b' causes NFkappaB activation and CCL22 expression, a phenotype that is not observed after infections with strains lacking the UL/b' region. Moreover, knockdown of UL144, TRAF6 or NFkappaB by specific siRNA in infections with UL144-encoding HCMV prevents the activation of CCL22 expression normally observed after infection with UL/b' positive HCMV. Upregulation of CCL22, which attracts Th2 and regulatory T cells, may help HCMV evade immune surveillance."
12730672,Physical and functional interaction between HCV core protein and the different p73 isoforms.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is a structural viral protein that packages the viral genomic RNA. In addition to this function, HCV core also modulates a number of cellular regulatory functions. In fact, HCV core protein has been found to modulate the expression of the cyclin-dependent inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) and to promote both apoptosis and cell proliferation through its physical interaction with p53. Here, we studied the ability of HCV core to bind the p53-related p73 protein, its isoforms and its deletion mutants. We found that HCV core co-immunoprecipitated with p73 in HepG2 and SAOS-2 cells. Deletion mutational analysis of p73 indicates that the domain involved in HCV core binding is located between amino-acid residues 321-353. We also demonstrate that p73/core interaction results in the nuclear translocation of HCV core protein either in the presence of the p73 alpha or p73 beta tumor-suppressor proteins. In addition, the interaction with HCV core protein prevents p73 alpha, but not p73 beta dependent cell growth arrest in a p53-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate that HCV core protein may directly influence the various p73 functions, thus playing a role in HCV pathogenesis."
11821416,Nonstructural 5A protein of hepatitis C virus modulates tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated nuclear factor kappa B activation.,"The hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a multifunctional phosphoprotein that leads to pleiotropic responses, in part by regulating cell growth and cellular signaling pathways. Here we show that overexpression of NS5A inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in HEK293 cells, as determined by luciferase reporter gene expression and by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. When overexpressed, NS5A cannot inhibit the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and IkappaB kinase (IKK)beta into the TNF receptor 1-TNF receptor-associated death domain complex. In contrast, NS5A is a part of the TNF receptor 1 signaling complex. NF-kappaB activation by TNF receptor-associated death domain and TRAF2 was inhibited by NS5A, whereas MEKK1 and IKKbeta-dependent NF-kappaB activation was not affected, suggesting that NS5A may inhibit NF-kappaB activation signaled by TRAF2. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization of NS5A and TRAF2 expressed in vivo provide compelling evidence that NS5A directly interacts with TRAF2. This interaction was mapped to the middle one-third (amino acids 148-301) of NS5A and the TRAF domain of TRAF2. Our findings suggest a possible molecular mechanism that could explain the ability of NS5A to negatively regulate TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation."
14985081,"Hepatitis C virus core protein interacts with p53-binding protein, 53BP2/Bbp/ASPP2, and inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis.","The core protein of Hepatitis C virus affects several biological functions of the host cells such as cellular growth and apoptosis. The core was shown to interact with 53BP2/Bbp/ASPP2, a p53-binding protein, in a yeast two-hybrid assay. The core competed with p53 in binding to ASPP2 in vitro. In an apoptosis assay using human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells or hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, ectopic expression of p53 induced apoptosis and ASPP2 enhanced this p53-induced apoptosis. However, coexpression of the core with p53 and ASPP2 increased the number of surviving cells. In a reporter assay, neither ASPP2 nor the core with ASPP2 affected the transcriptional activity of p53 on the promoters of Bax and p21, major p53 target genes. These findings suggest that the core inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis by blocking the interaction between p53 and ASPP2, without modulating the transcriptional activity of p53, which plays a role in oncogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma."
11743164,SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase as an intracellular target of Helicobacter pylori CagA protein.,"Helicobacter pylori CagA protein is associated with severe gastritis and gastric carcinoma. CagA is injected from the attached Helicobacter pylori into host cells and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. Wild-type but not phosphorylation-resistant CagA induced a growth factor-like response in gastric epithelial cells. Furthermore, CagA formed a physical complex with the SRC homology 2 domain (SH2)-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and stimulated the phosphatase activity. Disruption of the CagA-SHP-2 complex abolished the CagA-dependent cellular response. Conversely, the CagA effect on cells was reproduced by constitutively active SHP-2. Thus, upon translocation, CagA perturbs cellular functions by deregulating SHP-2."
12391297,Biological activity of the Helicobacter pylori virulence factor CagA is determined by variation in the tyrosine phosphorylation sites.,"Helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis and peptic ulcer. cagA(+) H. pylori strains are more virulent than cagA(-) strains and are associated with gastric carcinoma. The cagA gene product, CagA, is injected by the bacterium into gastric epithelial cells and subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. The phosphorylated CagA specifically binds SHP-2 phosphatase, activates the phosphatase activity, and thereby induces morphological transformation of cells. CagA proteins of most Western H. pylori isolates have a 34-amino acid sequence that variably repeats among different strains. Here, we show that the repeat sequence contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site. CagA proteins having more repeats were found to undergo greater tyrosine phosphorylation, to exhibit increased SHP-2 binding, and to induce greater morphological changes. In contrast, predominant CagA proteins specified by H. pylori strains isolated in East Asia, where gastric carcinoma is prevalent, had a distinct tyrosine phosphorylation sequence at the region corresponding to the repeat sequence of Western CagA. This East Asian-specific sequence conferred stronger SHP-2 binding and morphologically transforming activities to Western CagA. Finally, a critical amino acid residue that determines SHP-2 binding activity among different CagA proteins was identified. Our results indicate that the potential of individual CagA to perturb host-cell functions is determined by the degree of SHP-2 binding activity, which depends in turn on the number and sequences of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The presence of distinctly structured CagA proteins in Western and East Asian H. pylori isolates may underlie the strikingly different incidences of gastric carcinoma in these two geographic areas."
18198944,The viral oncoprotein LMP1 exploits TRADD for signaling by masking its apoptotic activity.,"The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor 1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) mediates induction of apoptosis as well as activation of NF-kappaB by cellular TNF-receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is also recruited by the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) oncoprotein of Epstein-Barr virus, but its role in LMP1 signaling has remained enigmatic. In human B lymphocytes, we have generated, to our knowledge, the first genetic knockout of TRADD to investigate TRADD's role in LMP1 signal transduction. Our data from TRADD-deficient cells demonstrate that TRADD is a critical signaling mediator of LMP1 that is required for LMP1 to recruit and activate I-kappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta). However, in contrast to TNFR1, LMP1-induced TRADD signaling does not induce apoptosis. Searching for the molecular basis for this observation, we characterized the 16 C-terminal amino acids of LMP1 as an autonomous and unique virus-derived TRADD-binding domain. Replacing the death domain of TNFR1 by LMP1's TRADD-binding domain converts TNFR1 into a nonapoptotic receptor that activates NF-kappaB through a TRAF6-dependent pathway, like LMP1 but unlike wild-type TNFR1. Thus, the unique interaction of LMP1 with TRADD encodes the transforming phenotype of viral TRADD signaling and masks TRADD's pro-apoptotic function."
15084397,The non-structural 3 (NS3) protein of dengue virus type 2 interacts with human nuclear receptor binding protein and is associated with alterations in membrane structure.,"Flaviviral infections produce a distinct array of virus-induced intracellular membrane alterations that are associated with the flaviviral replication machinery. Currently, it is still unknown which flaviviral protein(s) is/are responsible for this induction. Using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses, we demonstrated that the NS3 protein of dengue virus type 2 interacted specifically with nuclear receptor binding protein (NRBP), a host cellular protein that influences trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi, and that interacts with Rac3, a member of the Rho-GTPase family. Co-expression of NS3 and NRBP in baby hamster kidney cells exhibited significant subcellular co-localization, and revealed the redistribution of NRBP from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region. Furthermore, a set of membrane structures affiliated with the rough ER at the perinuclear region was induced in cells transfected with NS3. These structures are reminiscent of the virus-induced convoluted membranes previously observed in flavivirus-infected cells. This interaction between dengue viral and host cell proteins as well as the formation of the NS3-induced membrane structures suggest that NS3 may subvert the role of NRBP in ER-Golgi trafficking."
9175835,Tap: a novel cellular protein that interacts with tip of herpesvirus saimiri and induces lymphocyte aggregation.,"Tip of herpesvirus saimiri associates with Lck and down-regulates Lck-mediated activation. We identified a novel cellular Tip-associated protein (Tap) by a yeast two-hybrid screen. Tap associated with Tip following transient expression in COS-1 cells and stable expression in human Jurkat-T cells. Expression of Tip and Tap in Jurkat-T cells induced dramatic cell aggregation. Aggregation was likely caused by the up-regulated surface expression of adhesion molecules including integrin alpha, L-selectin, ICAM-3, and H-CAM. Furthermore, NF-kappaB transcriptional factor of aggregated cells had approximately 40-fold higher activity than that of parental cells. Thus, Tap is likely to be an important cellular mediator of Tip function in T cell transformation by herpesvirus saimiri."
16230340,Novel fluorescent prothrombin analogs as probes of staphylocoagulase-prothrombin interactions.,"Staphylocoagulase (SC) is a potent nonproteolytic prothrombin (ProT) activator and the prototype of a newly established zymogen activator and adhesion protein family. The staphylocoagulase fragment containing residues 1-325 (SC-(1-325)) represents a new type of nonproteolytic activator with a unique fold consisting of two three-helix bundle domains. The N-terminal, domain 1 of SC (D1, residues 1-146) interacts with the 148 loop of thrombin and prethrombin 2 and the south rim of the catalytic site, whereas domain 2 of SC (D2, residues 147-325) occupies (pro)exosite I, the fibrinogen (Fbg) recognition exosite. Reversible conformational activation of ProT by SC-(1-325) was used to create novel analogs of ProT covalently labeled at the catalytic site with fluorescence probes. Analogs selected from screening 10 such derivatives were used to characterize quantitatively equilibrium binding of SC-(1-325) to ProT, competitive binding with native ProT, and SC domain interactions. The results support the conclusion that SC-(1-325) binds to a single site on fluorescein-labeled and native ProT with indistinguishable dissociation constants of 17-72 pM. The results obtained for isolated SC domains indicate that D2 binds ProT with approximately 130-fold greater affinity than D1, yet D1 binding accounts for the majority of the fluorescence enhancement that accompanies SC-(1-325) binding. The SC-(1-325).(pro)thrombin complexes and free thrombin showed little difference in substrate specificity for tripeptide substrates or with their natural substrate, Fbg. Lack of a significant effect of blockage of (pro)exosite I of (pro)thrombin by SC-(1-325) on Fbg cleavage indicates that a new Fbg substrate recognition exosite is expressed on the SC-(1-325).(pro)thrombin complexes. Our results provide new insight into the mechanism that mediates zymogen activation by this prototypical bacterial activator."
9807817,"An Arabidopsis immunophilin, AtFKBP12, binds to AtFIP37 (FKBP interacting protein) in an interaction that is disrupted by FK506.","AtFKBP12 is an Arabidopsis cDNA that encodes a protein similar to the mammalian immunophilin, FKBP12. AtFKBP12 was used as 'bait' in a yeast 2-hybrid system to screen for cDNAs in Arabidopsis encoding proteins that bind to FKBP12. Two partial cDNAs were recovered encoding the C-terminus of a protein we have called Arabidopsis thaliana FKBP12 interacting protein 37 (AtFIP37). AtFIP37 is similar to a mammalian protein, FAP48, that also binds to FKBP12. The interaction between AtFKBP12 and AtFIP37 in the 2-hybrid system, as assessed by histidine auxotrophy and beta-galactosidase activity, was disrupted by FK506, but not by cyclosporin A, a drug that binds to cyclophilin A. AtFIP37 was also shown to bind in vitro to AtFKBP12 in GST-fusion protein binding assays. The binding was abolished by prior incubation of AtFKBP12 with FK506. These findings indicate that an Arabidopsis FKBP12 ortholog encodes a protein that binds FK506 and that the interaction between AtFKBP12 and AtFIP37 may involve the FK506 binding site of AtFKBP12. The interaction provides interesting new opportunities for controlling protein:protein interactions in vivo in plants."
15310821,Identification of ASK and clock-associated proteins as molecular partners of LKP2 (LOV kelch protein 2) in Arabidopsis.,"The ADO/FKF/LKP/ZTL family of proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana Heynh. have a LOV domain, an F-box motif, and a kelch repeat region. LKP2 is a member of this family and functions either within or very close to the circadian oscillator in Arabidopsis. Promoter-GUS fusion studies revealed that the LKP2 gene was highly active in rosette leaves. In CaMV 35S:LKP2-GFP plants, GFP-associated fluorescence was detected in nuclei, suggesting that LKP2 is a nuclear protein. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that LKP2 interacted with some Arabidopsis Skp1-like proteins (ASK), as do other ADO/FKF/LKP/ZTL family proteins, suggesting that LKP2 can form an SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein) complex that functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. LKP2 interacted not only with itself but also with other members of the family, LKP1 and FKF1. The two-hybrid analysis also demonstrated that LKP2 interacted with TOC1, a clock component, but not with CCA1 or LHY, negative regulators of TOC1 gene expression. The LOV domain of LKP2 was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the interaction with TOC1. An interaction between LKP2 and APRR5, a paralogue of TOC1, was also observed, but LKP2 did not interact with APRR3, APRR7, or APRR9, other paralogues of TOC1."
16003391,"AtBAG6, a novel calmodulin-binding protein, induces programmed cell death in yeast and plants.","Calmodulin (CaM) influences many cellular processes by interacting with various proteins. Here, we isolated AtBAG6, an Arabidopsis CaM-binding protein that contains a central BCL-2-associated athanogene (BAG) domain. In yeast and plants, overexpression of AtBAG6 induced cell death phenotypes consistent with programmed cell death (PCD). Recombinant AtBAG6 had higher affinity for CaM in the absence of free Ca2 + than in its presence. An IQ motif (IQXXXRGXXXR, where X denotes any amino-acid) was required for Ca2 +-independent CaM complex formation and single amino-acid changes within this motif abrogated both AtBAG6-activated CaM-binding and cell death in yeast and plants. A 134-amino-acid stretch, encompassing both the IQ motif and BAG domain, was sufficient to induce cell death. Agents generating oxygen radicals, which are known to be involved in plant PCD, specifically induced the AtBAG6 transcript. Collectively, these results suggest that AtBAG6 is a stress-upregulated CaM-binding protein involved in plant PCD."
12927518,IpaC of Shigella binds to the C-terminal domain of beta-catenin.,"IpaC of Shigella is essential for initial bacterial entry into epithelial cells. We report here that IpaC interacts with beta-catenin and destabilizes the cadherin-mediated cell adhesion complex. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified beta-catenin as a binding partner of IpaC within the host cell after cell entry, but not in the initial entry. Co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and GST pull-down experiments confirmed the intracellular and cell-free interactions between these two proteins. The interaction sites were mapped to the ninth armadillo repeat of beta-catenin and to the C-terminus of IpaC. IpaC-associated beta-catenin was phosphorylated at tyrosine residues. This phosphorylation led to the destabilization of the functional cadherin-catenin complex, which could be a mechanism whereby the epithelial cell-cell tight adhesion is disrupted. These events may facilitate the further basolateral invasion of bacteria through the disrupted space and/or modulate the cell-to-cell spread of Shigella."
12740913,EBV-encoded EBNA-5 associates with P14ARF in extranucleolar inclusions and prolongs the survival of P14ARF-expressing cells.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) carrying lymphoblastoid cells of normal origin express the full program of all 9 virus-encoded, growth transformation associated proteins. They have an intact p53 pathway as a rule. This raises the question of whether any of the viral proteins impair the pathway functionally. Using a yeast 2-hybrid system, we have shown that EBNA-5 but not the other EBNAs interacts with the p14ARF protein, a regulator of the p53 pathway. The interaction was confirmed in vitro using a GST pull-down assay. Moreover, expression of EBNA-5 increased the survival of p14ARF-transfected cells. EBV infection of resting B cells induced the expression of p14ARF mRNA without increased level of the protein. A fraction of the p14ARF localized to the nucleoli but the bulk of the protein accumulated in nuclear but extranucleolar inclusions. Formation of the extranucleolar inclusions led to complete relocalization of EBNA-5 from nucleoplasm to these structures. The inclusions also contained p53 and HDM2, and were surrounded by PML bodies and proteasomes, which suggests that these inclusions could be targets for proteasome dependent protein degradation."

9697699,A retinoblastoma-binding protein that affects cell-cycle control and confers transforming ability.,"The retinoblastoma (RB) gene is one of the most extensively studied tumour-suppressor genes. Deletion or inactivation of both RB alleles is an essential, rate-limiting step in the formation of retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma that arise in families that carry mutant RB (ref. 2). RB inactivation is also found in other human tumours. Whereas loss of RB function is associated with the loss of cellular proliferative control, introduction of a wild-type RB can suppress cell growth and tumorigenicity. Thus, identification of factors that interfere with and/or control the function of the RB protein is critical for understanding both cell-cycle control and oncogenesis. Here we describe a new gene, Bog (for B5T over-expressed gene), which was identified and shown to be overexpressed in several transformed rat liver epithelial (RLE) cell lines resistant to the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1, as well as in primary human liver tumours. The Bog protein shares homology with other retinoblastoma-binding proteins and contains the Rb-binding motif LXCXE. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that Bog binds to Rb. In vivo, Bog/Rb complexes do not contain E2F-1, and Bog can displace E2F-1 from E2F-1/Rb complexes in vitro. Overexpression of Bog in normal RLE cells conferred resistance to the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1. Furthermore, normal RLE cells are rapidly transformed when Bog is continuously overexpressed and form hepatoblastoma-like tumours when transplanted into nude mice. These data suggest that Bog may be important in the transformation process, in part due to its capacity to confer resistance to the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta1 through interaction with Rb and the subsequent displacement of E2F-1."
12185500,Fission yeast Cdc23 interactions with DNA replication initiation proteins.,"Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc23 is an essential DNA replication protein, conserved in eukaryotes and functionally homologous with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dna43 (Mcm10). We sought evidence for interactions between Cdc23 and the MCM2-7 complex, a component of both the pre-replicative complex and the replication fork. Cdc23 shows genetic interactions with four MCM subunits: cdc23-M36 and cdc23-1E2 alleles both show synthetic phenotypes with mcm2 (cdc19-P1) and mcm6 (mis5-268), and cdc23-M36 is synthetically lethal with mcm4 (cdc21-K46) and with mcm5 (nda4-108). The wild-type cdc23 gene on multicopy plasmids can partially suppress temperature-dependent defects in mcm5 (nda4-108). Two-hybrid analysis demonstrates interactions at the protein-protein level between Cdc23 and Mcm4, Mcm5 and Mcm6. Cdc23 also interacts with four subunits of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe origin recognition complex (ORC) in yeast two-hybrid assay: Orc1, Orc2, Orc5 and Orc6. We found no evidence for interaction between Cdc23 and the MCM recruitment factor Cdc18 (the homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc6). Unlike Cdc18, Cdc23 mRNA shows no significant fluctuation in level through the cell cycle. These data suggest that fission yeast Cdc23 is an MCM-associated factor which has a role in the initiation of DNA replication."
10226625,The yeast two-hybrid system reveals no interaction between p73 alpha and SV40 large T-antigen.,"SV40 and/or DNA sequences indistinguishable from SV40 have been detected in several types of human tumours. The oncoprotein of Simian virus 40, SV40 large T-antigen (Tag), is known to bind and inactivate tumour suppressor proteins, such as members of the retinoblastoma family and p53, thereby promoting cell transformation. In this study, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to investigate whether the Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T-antigen is able to interact with p73, a noval discovered putative tumour suppressor, that is homologous both structurally and functionally to p53. The yeast two-hybrid system is a genetic method to detect protein-protein-interactions in vivo. Our results suggest that the SV40 large T-antigen is not able to bind p73 in yeast although both proteins are expressed in the transformed yeast strain as was shown by western blot analysis."
17662718,Protein-protein interactions among human lens acidic and basic beta-crystallins.,"Human lens beta-crystallin contains four acidic (betaA1-->betaA4) and three basic (betaB1-->betaB3) subunits. They oligomerize in the lens, but it is uncertain which subunits are involved in the oligomerization. We used a two-hybrid system to detect protein-protein interactions systematically. Proteins were also expressed for some physicochemical studies. The results indicate that all acidic-basic pairs (betaA-betaB) except betaA4-betaBs pairs show strong hetero-molecular interactions. For acidic or basic pairs, only two pairs (betaA1-betaA1 and betaA3-betaA3) show strong self-association. betaA2 and betaA4 show very weak self-association, which arises from their low solubility. Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows enormous protein aggregates in betaA2- or betaA4-crystallin transfected cells. However, coexpression with betaB2-crystallin decreased both the number and size of aggregates. Circular dichroism indicates subtle differences in conformation among beta-crystallins that may have contributed to the differences in interactions."
15862300,The nucleocapsid protein of SARS coronavirus has a high binding affinity to the human cellular heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1.,"The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS coronavirus (SARS_CoV) is a major structural component of virions, which appears to be a multifunctional protein involved in viral RNA replication and translation. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is related to the pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translation regulation in the cytoplasm. In this report, based on the relevant biophysical and biochemical assays, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS_CoV (SARS_N) was discovered to exhibit high binding affinity to human hnRNP A1. GST pull-down results clearly demonstrated that SARS_N protein could directly and specifically bind to human hnRNP A1 in vitro. Yeast two-hybrid assays further indicated in vivo that such binding relates to the fragment (aa 161-210) of SARS_N and the Gly-rich domain (aa 203-320) of hnRNP A1. Moreover, kinetic analyses by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology revealed that SARS_N protein has a specific binding affinity against human hnRNP A1 with K(D) at 0.35 +/- 0.02 microM (k(on) = 5.83 +/- 0.42 x 10(3) M(-1)s(-1) and k(off) = 2.06 +/- 0.12 x 10(-3)s(-1)). It is suggested that both SARS_N and hnRNP A1 proteins are possibly within the SARS_CoV replication/transcription complex and SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction might function in the regulation of SARS_CoV RNA synthesis. In addition, the determined results showed that SARS_N protein has only one binding domain for interacting with human hnRNP A1, which is different from the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) binding case where the nucleocapsid protein of MHV (MHV_N) was found to have two binding domains involved in the MHV_N/hnRNP A1 interaction, thereby suggesting that SARS_N protein might carry out a different binding mode to bind to human hnRNP A1 for its further function performance in comparison with MHV_N."
9467941,Association of Bovine Papillomavirus Type 1 E6 oncoprotein with the focal adhesion protein paxillin through a conserved protein interaction motif.,"We have found that the E6 oncoprotein of Bovine Papillomavirus Type 1 (BE6) as well as the E6 protein of the cancer associated HPV-16 (16E6) interact with the focal adhesion protein paxillin. Mutational analysis of paxillin revealed that BE6 binds paxillin through small protein interaction motifs called LD motifs that have been previously identified as important in regulating association of paxillin with vinculin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and that BE6 can interact with at least two separate binding sites on paxillin. The LD motifs of paxillin that bind BE6 share homology with the E6 binding site of E6-AP, a ubiquitin ligase that together with 16E6 targets the degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor. Paxillin binding to BE6 excludes simultaneous binding to E6-AP. Mutational analysis of BE6 can distinguish the interaction of BE6 with E6-AP compared to paxillin and revealed that the interaction of BE6 with paxillin may be necessary for the induction of anchorage independent growth of cells by BE6."
10383418,"Characterization of DP103, a novel DEAD box protein that binds to the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear proteins EBNA2 and EBNA3C.","The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigens EBNA2 and EBNA3C both interact with the cellular transcription factor RBP-Jkappa and modulate the expression of several shared target genes, suggesting a tight cooperation in latently infected cells. In a survey for additional cellular factors that bind to EBNA2 as well as EBNA3C, we have isolated and characterized DP103, a novel human member of the DEAD box family of putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases. The interaction with DP103 is mediated by amino acids (aa) 121-213 of EBNA2 and aa 534-778 of EBNA3C, regions that are not involved in binding of the viral proteins to RBP-Jkappa. The DP103-cDNA encodes a protein of 824 aa that harbors all of the common DEAD box motifs. Monoclonal antibodies raised against DP103 detect a protein of 103 kDa in mammalian cells that resides in high molecular weight complexes in vivo. We have detected an ATPase activity intrinsic to or closely associated with DP103. By subcellular fractionation, we find DP103 in both a soluble nuclear fraction as well as in the insoluble skeletal fraction. Whereas the protein and its mRNA are uniformly expressed in all tested cell lines, we observed differential expression of the mRNA in normal human tissues."
10799599,Nonstructural protein 5A of hepatitis C virus inhibits the function of karyopherin beta3.,"It has been suggested that nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) plays a role in the incapacitation of interferon by inactivation of RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR. In order to further investigate the role of NS5A, we tried to identify cellular proteins interacting with NS5A by using the yeast two-hybrid system. The karyopherin beta3 gene was isolated from a human liver cell library as a protein interacting with NS5A. The protein-protein interaction between NS5A and karyopherin beta3 was confirmed by in vitro binding assay and an in vivo coimmunoprecipitation method. The effect of NS5A on the karyopherin beta3 activity was investigated using a yeast cell line containing mutations in both PSE1 and KAP123, genes that are homologous to the human karyopherin beta3 gene. Human karyopherin beta3 complemented the loss of the PSE1 and KAP123 functions, supporting growth of the double mutant cells. However, expression of NS5A hampered the growth of the double mutant cells supplemented with human karyopherin beta3. On the other hand, expression of NS5A by itself had no effect on the growth of the double mutant expressing wild-type yeast PSE1. This indicates that NS5A may inhibit karyopherin beta3 function via protein-protein interaction. The role of NS5A in HCV replication is discussed."
10205180,Influenza A virus NS1 protein targets poly(A)-binding protein II of the cellular 3'-end processing machinery.,"Influenza A virus NS1 protein (NS1A protein) via its effector domain targets the poly(A)-binding protein II (PABII) of the cellular 3'-end processing machinery. In vitro the NS1A protein binds the PABII protein, and in vivo causes PABII protein molecules to relocalize from nuclear speckles to a uniform distribution throughout the nucleoplasm. In vitro the NS1A protein inhibits the ability of PABII to stimulate the processive synthesis of long poly(A) tails catalyzed by poly(A) polymerase (PAP). Such inhibition also occurs in vivo in influenza virus-infected cells, where the NS1A protein via its effector domain causes the nuclear accumulation of cellular pre-mRNAs which contain short ( approximately 12 nucleotide) poly(A) tails. Consequently, although the NS1A protein also binds the 30 kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), 3' cleavage of some cellular pre-mRNAs still occurs in virus-infected cells, followed by the PAP-catalyzed addition of short poly(A) tails. Subsequent elongation of these short poly(A) tails is blocked because the NS1A protein inhibits PABII function. Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of PABII, an activity implicating this protein in the nuclear export of cellular mRNAs, is also inhibited by the NS1A protein. In vitro assays suggest that the 30 kDa CPSF and PABII proteins bind to non-overlapping regions of the NS1A protein effector domain and indicate that these two 3' processing proteins also directly bind to each other."
17446270,Epstein-Barr virus and virus human protein interaction maps.,"A comprehensive mapping of interactions among Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proteins and interactions of EBV proteins with human proteins should provide specific hypotheses and a broad perspective on EBV strategies for replication and persistence. Interactions of EBV proteins with each other and with human proteins were assessed by using a stringent high-throughput yeast two-hybrid system. Overall, 43 interactions between EBV proteins and 173 interactions between EBV and human proteins were identified. EBV-EBV and EBV-human protein interaction, or ""interactome"" maps provided a framework for hypotheses of protein function. For example, LF2, an EBV protein of unknown function interacted with the EBV immediate early R transactivator (Rta) and was found to inhibit Rta transactivation. From a broader perspective, EBV genes can be divided into two evolutionary classes, ""core"" genes, which are conserved across all herpesviruses and subfamily specific, or ""noncore"" genes. Our EBV-EBV interactome map is enriched for interactions among proteins in the same evolutionary class. Furthermore, human proteins targeted by EBV proteins were enriched for highly connected or ""hub"" proteins and for proteins with relatively short paths to all other proteins in the human interactome network. Targeting of hubs might be an efficient mechanism for EBV reorganization of cellular processes."
16112766,Interaction of the hepatitis B virus protein HBx with the human transcription regulatory protein p120E4F in vitro.,"Infection with the hepatitis B virus has been identified as one of the major causes of liver cancer. A large body of experimental work points to a central role for the virally encoded protein HBx in this form of carcinogenesis. HBx is expressed in HBV-infected liver cells and interacts with a wide range of cellular proteins, thereby interfering in cellular processes including cell signaling, cycle regulation and apoptosis. In order to identify possible new targets of the HBx protein, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a truncated protein mini-HBx(18-142) as the bait. In addition to known interacting partners, such as RXR and UVDDB1, we identified several new candidates including the human transcriptional regulatory protein p120E4F, which has been implicated in the regulation of mitosis and the cell cycle. In vitro pull down experiments confirmed the interaction and transcription activation assays in the yeast demonstrated that HBx protein was able to repress GAL4AD-p120E4F-dependent activation of a reporter gene under the control of E4F binding sites found in the adenovirus E4 promoter and the HBV enhancer II region. We also showed that the cysteine residues in HBx are necessary for its interaction with UVDDB1 but not for the interaction with RXR or p120E4F. The possible functional relevance of the interaction between HBx and E4F proteins is discussed in the contexts of cellular transformation and host-virus co-evolution."
10849009,The PKC targeting protein RACK1 interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus activator protein BZLF1.,"Phorbol esters reactivate Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from latently infected cells via transcriptional activation of the viral immediate-early gene BZLF1. BZLF1 is a member of the extended AP-1 family of transcription factors that binds to specific BZLF1-binding motifs within early EBV promoters and to consensus AP-1 sites. Regulation of BZLF1's activity is achieved at the transcriptional level as well as through post-translational modifications. Recently, we reported that the transcriptional activity of BZLF1 is augmented by TPA [Baumann, M., Mischak, H., Dammeier, S., Kolch, W., Gires, O., Pich, D., Zeidler, R., Delecluse, H. J. & Hammerschmidt, W., (1998) J. Virol. 72, 8105-8114]. The increase of BZLF1's activity depends on a single serine residue (S186) that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro and in vivo after stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Here, we identified RACK1 as a binding partner of BZLF1 in a yeast interaction trap assay. RACK stands for receptor of activated C-kinase and is involved in targeting activated PKCs and other signaling proteins. In vivo, RACK1 binds directly to the transactivation domain of BZLF1. Although a functional relationship between BZLF1 and PKC could be mediated by RACKs, RACK1 did not have a detectable effect on the phosphorylation status of BZLF1 in in vitro or in vivo phosphorylation assays. We suggest that RACK1 may act as a scaffolding protein on BZLF1 independently of activated PKCs."
10891508,Modulation of histone acetyltransferase activity through interaction of epstein-barr nuclear antigen 3C with prothymosin alpha.,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is essential for EBV-dependent immortalization of human primary B lymphocytes. Genetic analysis indicated that amino acids 365 to 992 are important for EBV-mediated immortalization of B lymphocytes. We demonstrate that this region of EBNA3C critical for immortalization interacts with prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha), a cellular protein previously identified to be important for cell division and proliferation. This interaction maps to a region downstream of amino acid 365 known to be involved in transcription regulation and critical for EBV-mediated transformation of primary B lymphocytes. Additionally, we show that EBNA3C also interacts with p300, a cellular acetyltransferase. This interaction suggests a possible role in regulation of histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling. An increase in histone acetylation was observed in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, which is consistent with increased cellular gene expression. These cells express the entire repertoire of latent nuclear antigens, including EBNA3C. Expression of EBNA3C in cells with increased acetyltransferase activity mediated by the EBV transactivator EBNA2 results in down-modulation of this activity in a dose-responsive manner. The interactions of EBNA3C with ProTalpha and p300 provide new evidence implicating this essential EBV protein EBNA3C in modulating the acetylation of cellular factors, including histones. Hence, EBNA3C plays a critical role in balancing cellular transcriptional events by linking the biological property of mediating inhibition of EBNA2 transcription activation and the observed histone acetyltransferase activity, thereby orchestrating immortalization of EBV-infected cells."
7597030,Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation.,"Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation."
8344494,Identification of mutations in p53 that affect its binding to SV40 large T antigen by using the yeast two-hybrid system.,"The tumor suppressor p53 protein binds to the products of several viral oncogenes, including SV40 large T antigen. We reconstructed the p53-T antigen interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay that uses the reconstitution of the activity of a transcriptional activator to detect protein-protein interactions. Using mutants of T antigen known to be defective in binding to p53, we demonstrate that the two-hybrid system is more sensitive than immunoprecipitation in the detection of weak interactions. We mutagenized the murine p53 gene and screened in the yeast assay for decreased reporter gene expression indicative of the failure of p53 to bind T antigen. This screen identified 34 p53 mutants, almost all of which contain at least one mutation in the conserved domains frequently found mutated in human cancers. These results support the idea that the function of the wild-type p53 protein requires residues involved in binding to T antigen, and indicate that this approach may be generally applicable in the analysis of protein-protein interactions."
7815490,Hepatitis B virus X protein interacts with a probable cellular DNA repair protein.,"The mechanism of action of hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein in transcriptional transactivation and in tumorigenesis remains obscure. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify a cellular protein that can interact with HBV X protein. This protein, designated X-associated protein 1 (XAP-1), is a human homolog of the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) recovered from a monkey cell cDNA library. UV-DDB is presumed to be involved in DNA repair. The interaction between X protein and XAP-1 protein was verified by immunoprecipitation of yeast cell lysates expressing both proteins and by in vitro mixing with X protein expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and XAP-1 protein either in HeLa cell extracts or synthesized by in vitro translation. We speculate that the interaction of X protein with a DNA repair protein may recruit cellular proteins to repair the partially double-stranded HBV genome or may modify cellular transcription processes. An effect on the cellular DNA repair system may explain a cofactor role for HBV in liver cancer development."
11207560,CD44 binds to the Shigella IpaB protein and participates in bacterial invasion of epithelial cells.,"Shigella entry into epithelial cells is characterized by a transient reorganization of the host cell cytoskeleton at the site of bacterial interaction with the cell membrane, which leads to bacterial engulfment in a macropinocytic process. Using affinity chromatography on HeLa cell extracts, we show here that the hyaluronan receptor CD44 associates with IpaB, a Shigella protein that is secreted upon cell contact. Overlay and solid-phase assays indicated that IpaB binds directly to the extracellular domain of CD44; binding is saturable and inhibitable, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 175 nM. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that IpaB associates with CD44 during Shigella entry. CD44 is recruited at bacterial entry sites and localizes at the plasma membrane of cellular extensions induced by Shigella. Pretreatment of cells with an anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody resulted in inhibition of Shigella-induced cytoskeletal reorganization, as well as inhibition of bacterial entry, whereas transfection of CD44 in cells that are deficient for CD44 results in increased bacterial binding to cells and internalization. The IpaB-CD44 interaction appears to be required for Shigella invasion by initiating the early steps of the entry process."
1321290,Interaction of the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 oncoprotein with wild-type and mutant human p53 proteins.,"The E6 oncoproteins encoded by the cancer-associated human papillomaviruses (HPVs) can associate with and promote the degradation of wild-type p53 in vitro. To gain further insight into this process, the ability of HPV-16 E6 to complex with and promote the degradation of mutant forms of p53 was studied. A correlation between binding and the targeted degradation of p53 was established. Mutant p53 proteins that bound HPV-16 E6 were targeted for degradation, whereas those that did not complex HPV-16 E6 were not degraded. Since the HPV-16 E6-promoted degradation involves the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis pathway, specific mutations were made in the amino terminus of p53 to examine whether the E6 targeted degradation involved the N-end rule pathway. No requirement for destabilizing amino acids at the N terminus of p53 was found, nor was evidence found that HPV-16 E6 could provide this determinant in trans, indicating that the N-terminal rule pathway is not involved in the E6-promoted degradation of p53."
15254196,p53 targets simian virus 40 large T antigen for acetylation by CBP.,"Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (T Ag) interacts with the tumor suppressor p53 and the transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300. Binding of these cellular proteins in a ternary complex has been implicated in T Ag-mediated transformation. It has been suggested that the ability of CBP/p300 to modulate p53 function underlies p53's regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In this study, we provide further evidence that CBP activity may be mediated through its synergistic action with p53. We demonstrate that SV40 T Ag is acetylated in vivo in a p53-dependent manner and T Ag acetylation is largely mediated by CBP. The acetylation of T Ag is dependent on its interaction with p53 and on p53's interaction with CBP. We have mapped the site of acetylation on T Ag to the C-terminal lysine residue 697. This acetylation site is conserved between the T antigens of the human polyomaviruses JC and BK, which are also known to interact with p53. We show that both JC and BK T antigens are also acetylated at corresponding sites in vivo. While other proteins are known to be acetylated by CBP/p300, none are known to depend on p53 for acetylation. T Ag acetylation may provide a regulatory mechanism for T Ag binding to a cellular factor or play a role in another aspect of T Ag function."
10779772,IL-6 receptor independent stimulation of human gp130 by viral IL-6.,"The genome of human herpes virus 8, which is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, encodes proteins with similarities to cytokines and chemokines including a homologue of IL-6. Although the function of these viral proteins is unclear, they might have the potential to modulate the immune system. For viral IL-6 (vIL-6), it has been demonstrated that it stimulates IL-6-dependent cells, indicating that the IL-6R system is used. IL-6 binds to IL-6R, and the IL-6/IL-6R complex associates with gp130 which dimerizes and initiates intracellular signaling. Cells that only express gp130 but no IL-6R cannot be stimulated by IL-6 unless a soluble form of the IL-6R is present. This type of signaling has been shown for hematopoietic progenitor cells, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. In this paper we show that purified recombinant vIL-6 binds to gp130 and stimulates primary human smooth muscle cells. IL-6R fails to bind vIL-6 and is not involved in its signaling. A Fc fusion protein of gp130 turned out to be a potent inhibitor of vIL-6. Our data demonstrate that vIL-6 is the first cytokine which directly binds and activates gp130. This property points to a possible role of this viral cytokine in the pathophysiology of human herpes virus 8."
12359749,Human kin17 protein directly interacts with the simian virus 40 large T antigen and inhibits DNA replication.,"Kin17 is an evolutionarily conserved DNA-binding protein, which forms intranuclear foci in proliferating cells. Recent data have suggested that human kin17 protein is associated with cell proliferation and unrepaired DNA lesions. Herein, we show that human fibroblasts (MRC5-V2 and CHSV4) immortalized with SV40 overexpress endogenous kin17 protein, as compared with normal diploid human fibroblasts. We observed that certain carcinoma cell lines also up-regulated kin17 protein, suggesting that increased kin17 protein levels may be a consequence of the immortalized phenotype. We report here that the endogenous kin17 protein is located in nucleoplasmic foci and colocalizes with SV40 large T antigen. Purification of human kin17 protein allowed analysis of the physical interaction with T antigen by several in vitro and in vivo assays. Large T antigen and human kin17 protein are part of the same high molecular weight multiprotein complex in human cells. Furthermore, human kin17 protein interacts with T antigen bound to the SV40 DNA origin of replication. Strikingly, the overexpression of human kin17 protein in vivo and the introduction of increased amounts of human kin17 protein in an in vitro assay reduced T-antigen-dependent DNA replication, suggesting that kin17 protein may be involved in the DNA replication process in human cells."
8132330,Lactoferrin binds to porins OmpF and OmpC in Escherichia coli.,"Lactoferrin (Lf) is an iron-binding antimicrobial protein present in milk and on mucosal surfaces, with a suggested role in preimmune host defense. Certain strains of Escherichia coli (bacterial whole cells) demonstrate specific interaction with 125I-labeled Lf. A band with a mass of approximately 37 kDa, which was reactive with horseradish peroxidase-labeled Lf, was identified in the boiled cell envelope and outer membrane preparations of an Lf-binding E. coli strain, E34663, and a non-Lf-binding strain, HH45, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting (immunoblotting). Such a band was not detected in the unboiled native cell envelope and outer membrane preparations. The molecular mass and the property of heat modifiability suggested that the Lf-binding proteins were porins. The native trimeric form of porin OmpF isolated from strain B6 and its dissociated monomeric form both reacted with horseradish peroxidase-labeled Lf and with monoclonal antibodies specific for OmpF. Furthermore, by using E. coli constructs with defined porin phenotypes, OmpF and OmpC were identified as the Lf-binding proteins by urea-SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and by 125I-Lf binding studies with intact bacteria. These data establish that Lf binds to porins, a class of well-conserved molecules common in E. coli and many other gram-negative bacteria. However, in certain strains of E. coli these pore-forming proteins are shielded from Lf interaction."
10662783,The tetraspanin CD9 associates with transmembrane TGF-alpha and regulates TGF-alpha-induced EGF receptor activation and cell proliferation.,"Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is a member of the EGF growth factor family. Both transmembrane TGF-alpha and the proteolytically released soluble TGF-alpha can bind to the EGF/TGF-alpha tyrosine kinase receptor (EGFR) and activate the EGFR-induced signaling pathways. We now demonstrate that transmembrane TGF-alpha physically interacts with CD9, a protein with four membrane spanning domains that is frequently coexpressed with TGF-alpha in carcinomas. This interaction was mediated through the extracellular domain of transmembrane TGF-alpha. CD9 expression strongly decreased the growth factor- and PMA- induced proteolytic conversions of transmembrane to soluble TGF-alpha and strongly enhanced the TGF- alpha-induced EGFR activation, presumably in conjunction with increased expression of transmembrane TGF-alpha. In juxtacrine assays, the CD9-induced EGFR hyperactivation by transmembrane TGF-alpha resulted in increased proliferation. In contrast, CD9 coexpression with transmembrane TGF-alpha decreased the autocrine growth stimulatory effect of TGF-alpha in epithelial cells. This decrease was associated with increased expression of the cdk inhibitor, p21(CIP1). These data reveal that the association of CD9 with transmembrane TGF-alpha regulates ligand-induced activation of the EGFR, and results in altered cell proliferation."
11462050,Physical and functional interactions between the corepressor CtBP and the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen EBNA3C.,"CtBP has been shown to be a highly conserved corepressor of transcription. E1A and all the various transcription factors to which CtBP binds contain a conserved PLDLS CtBP-interacting domain, and EBNA3C includes a PLDLS motif (amino acids [aa] 728 to 732). Here we show that EBNA3C binds to CtBP both in vitro and in vivo and that the interaction requires an intact PLDLS. The C terminus of EBNA3C (aa 580 to 992) has modest trans-repressor activity when it is fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4, and deletion or mutation of the PLDLS sequence ablates this and unmasks a transactivation function within the fragment. However, loss of the CtBP interaction motif had little effect on the ability of full-length EBNA3C to repress transcription. A striking correlation between CtBP binding and the capacity of EBNA3C to cooperate with (Ha-)Ras in the immortalization and transformation of primary rat embryo fibroblasts was also revealed."
9582270,Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein is implicated in the actin-based motility of Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, is capable of directing its own movement in the cytoplasm of infected epithelial cells. The bacterial surface protein VirG recruits host components mediating actin polymerization, which is thought to serve as the propulsive force. Here, we show that neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), which is a critical target for filopodium formation downstream of Cdc42, is required for assembly of the actin tail generated by intracellular S.flexneri. N-WASP accumulates at the front of the actin tail and is capable of interacting with VirG in vitro and in vivo, a phenomenon that is not observed in intracellular Listeria monocytogenes. The verprolin-homology region in N-WASP was required for binding to the glycine-rich repeats domain of VirG, an essential domain for recruitment of F-actin on intracellular S.flexneri. Overexpression of a dominant-negative N-WASP mutant greatly inhibited formation of the actin tail by intracellular S.flexneri. Furthermore, depletion of N-WASP from Xenopus egg extracts shut off Shigella actin tail assembly, and this was restored upon addition of N-WASP protein, suggesting that N-WASP is a critical host factor for the assembly of the actin tail by intracellular Shigella."
11046148,Latent membrane protein 2A of Epstein-Barr virus binds WW domain E3 protein-ubiquitin ligases that ubiquitinate B-cell tyrosine kinases.,"The latent membrane protein (LMP) 2A of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is implicated in the maintenance of viral latency and appears to function in part by inhibiting B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. The N-terminal cytoplasmic region of LMP2A has multiple tyrosine residues that upon phosphorylation bind the SH2 domains of the Syk tyrosine kinase and the Src family kinase Lyn. The LMP2A N-terminal region also has two conserved PPPPY motifs. Here we show that the PPPPY motifs of LMP2A bind multiple WW domains of E3 protein-ubiquitin ligases of the Nedd4 family, including AIP4 and KIAA0439, and demonstrate that AIP4 and KIAA0439 form physiological complexes with LMP2A in EBV-positive B cells. In addition to a C2 domain and four WW domains, these proteins have a C-terminal Hect catalytic domain implicated in the ubiquitination of target proteins. LMP2A enhances Lyn and Syk ubiquitination in vivo in a fashion that depends on the activity of Nedd4 family members and correlates with destabilization of the Lyn tyrosine kinase. These results suggest that LMP2A serves as a molecular scaffold to recruit both B-cell tyrosine kinases and C2/WW/Hect domain E3 protein-ubiquitin ligases. This may promote Lyn and Syk ubiquitination in a fashion that contributes to a block in B-cell signaling. LMP2A may potentiate a normal mechanism by which Nedd4 family E3 enzymes regulate B-cell signaling."
12604805,Identification and characterization of amphiphysin II as a novel cellular interaction partner of the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein is highly phosphorylated by cellular protein kinases. To study how NS5A might be integrated in cellular kinase signalling, we isolated phosphoproteins from HuH-7 hepatoma cells that specifically interacted with recombinant NS5A protein. Subsequent mass spectrometry identified the adaptor protein amphiphysin II as a novel interaction partner of NS5A. Mutational analysis revealed that complex formation is primarily mediated by a proline-rich region in the C-terminal part of NS5A, which interacts with the amphiphysin II Src homology 3 domain. Importantly, we could further demonstrate specific co-precipitation and cellular co-localization of endogenous amphiphysin II with NS5A in HuH-7 cells carrying a persistently replicating subgenomic HCV replicon. Although the NS5A-amphiphysin II interaction appeared to be dispensable for replication of these HCV RNAs in cell culture, our results indicate that NS5A-amphiphysin II complex formation might be of physiological relevance for the HCV life cycle."
9114003,The bovine papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein interacts with paxillin and disrupts the actin cytoskeleton.,"The E6 oncoprotein of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) has been shown to transform cells through a p53-independent pathway, but its transforming mechanism is unknown. Here we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo interactions between BPV-1 E6 and the focal adhesion protein paxillin. The ability of BPV-1 E6 to complex with paxillin correlated with its ability to transform; E6 mutant proteins impaired in their transformation function also were impaired in their abilities to bind paxillin. E6 binding to paxillin also may contribute to the carcinogenic potential of the human papillomavirus (HPV); we were able to show in vitro binding of paxillin to the E6 proteins of the cancer-associated type HPV 16 but not of the nononcogenic types 6 and 11. The association of E6 with paxillin was affected by depolymerization of the actin fiber network, and overexpression of BPV-1 E6 led to disruption of actin fiber formation. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton is a characteristic of many transformed cells, and, in BPV-1 transformed cells, may be mediated by BPV-1 E6 through its interaction with paxillin."
2005966,A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product.,"Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important."
12065415,Prohibitin requires Brg-1 and Brm for the repression of E2F and cell growth.,"E2F transcription factors play a major role in controlling mammalian cell cycle progression. We recently reported that a potential tumor suppressor, prohibitin, which interacts with retinoblastoma protein (Rb), regulates E2F function and this activity correlates with its growth-suppressive activity. We show here that prohibitin recruits Brg-1/Brm to E2F-responsive promoters, and that this recruitment is required for the repression of E2F-mediated transcription by prohibitin. Expression of a dominant-negative Brg-1 or Brm releases prohibitin-mediated repression of E2F and relieves prohibitin-mediated growth suppression. Although prohibitin associates with, and recruits, Brg-1 and Brm independently of Rb, prohibitin/Brg-1/Brm-mediated transcriptional repression requires Rb. A viral oncoprotein, SV40 large T antigen, can reverse prohibitin-mediated suppression of E2F-mediated gene transcription, and targets prohibitin through interruption of the association between prohibitin and Brg-1/Brm without affecting the prohibitin-E2F interaction."
10559330,Physical and functional interaction between the Y-box binding protein YB-1 and human polyomavirus JC virus large T antigen.,"Y-box binding protein YB-1 is a member of a family of DNA and RNA binding proteins which have been shown to affect gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. We have previously shown that YB-1 modulates transcription from the promoters of the ubiquitous human polyomavirus JC virus (JCV). Here we investigate the physical and functional interplay between YB-1 and the viral regulatory protein large T antigen (T-antigen), using JCV as a model system. Results of mobility band shift assays demonstrated that the efficiency of binding of YB-1 to a 23-bp single-stranded viral target sequence was significantly increased when T-antigen was included in the binding reaction mixture. Affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that YB-1 and T-antigen physically interact with each other. Additionally, results of transcription studies demonstrated that these two proteins interact functionally on the JCV early and late gene promoters. Whereas ectopic expression of YB-1 and T-antigen results in synergistic transactivation of the viral late promoter, YB-1 alleviates T-antigen-mediated transcriptional suppression of the viral early promoter activity. Furthermore, we have localized, through the use of a series of deletion mutants, the sequences of these proteins which are important for their interaction. The T-antigen-interacting region of YB-1 is located in the cold shock domain of YB-1 and its immediate flanking sequences, and the YB-1-interacting domain of T-antigen maps to the carboxy-terminal half of T-antigen. Results of transient transfection assays with various YB-1 mutants and T-antigen expression constructs confirm the specificity of the functional interaction between YB-1 and T-antigen. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the cellular factor YB-1 and the viral regulatory protein T-antigen interact both physically and functionally and that this interaction modulates transcription from the JCV promoters."
17662939,Structure of the human receptor tyrosine kinase met in complex with the Listeria invasion protein InlB.,"The tyrosine kinase Met, the product of the c-met proto-oncogene and the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), mediates signals critical for cell survival and migration. The human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes exploits Met signaling for invasion of host cells via its surface protein InlB. We present the crystal structure of the complex between a large fragment of the human Met ectodomain and the Met-binding domain of InlB. The concave face of the InlB leucine-rich repeat region interacts tightly with the first immunoglobulin-like domain of the Met stalk, a domain which does not bind HGF/SF. A second contact between InlB and the Met Sema domain locks the otherwise flexible receptor in a rigid, signaling competent conformation. Full Met activation requires the additional C-terminal domains of InlB which induce heparin-mediated receptor clustering and potent signaling. Thus, although it elicits a similar cellular response, InlB is not a structural mimic of HGF/SF."
19000816,Structural basis for parasite-specific functions of the divergent profilin of Plasmodium falciparum.,"Profilins are key regulators of actin dynamics. They sequester actin monomers, forming a pool for rapid polymer formation stimulated by proteins such as formins. Apicomplexan parasites utilize a highly specialized microfilament system for motility and host cell invasion. Their genomes encode only a small number of divergent actin regulators. We present the first crystal structure of an apicomplexan profilin, that of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, alone and in complex with a polyproline ligand peptide. The most striking feature of Plasmodium profilin is a unique minidomain consisting of a large beta-hairpin extension common to all apicomplexan parasites, and an acidic loop specific for Plasmodium species. Reverse genetics in the rodent malaria model, Plasmodium berghei, suggests that profilin is essential for the invasive blood stages of the parasite. Together, our data establish the structural basis for understanding the functions of profilin in the malaria parasite."
18488039,Structural basis of Nipah and Hendra virus attachment to their cell-surface receptor ephrin-B2.,"Nipah and Hendra viruses are emergent paramyxoviruses, causing disease characterized by rapid onset and high mortality rates, resulting in their classification as Biosafety Level 4 pathogens. Their attachment glycoproteins are essential for the recognition of the cell-surface receptors ephrin-B2 (EFNB2) and ephrin-B3 (EFNB3). Here we report crystal structures of both Nipah and Hendra attachment glycoproteins in complex with human EFNB2. In contrast to previously solved paramyxovirus attachment complexes, which are mediated by sialic acid interactions, the Nipah and Hendra complexes are maintained by an extensive protein-protein interface, including a crucial phenylalanine side chain on EFNB2 that fits snugly into a hydrophobic pocket on the viral protein. By analogy with the development of antivirals against sialic acid binding viruses, these results provide a structural template to target antiviral inhibition of protein-protein interactions."
12119400,Structure of decay-accelerating factor bound to echovirus 7: a virus-receptor complex.,"Echoviruses are enteroviruses that belong to Picornaviridae. Many echoviruses use decay-accelerating factor (DAF) as their cellular receptor. DAF is a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored complement regulatory protein found on most cell surfaces. It functions to protect cells from complement attack. The cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of echovirus 7 complexed with DAF show that the DAF-binding regions are located close to the icosahedral twofold axes, in contrast to other enterovirus complexes where the viral canyon is the receptor binding site. This novel receptor binding position suggests that DAF is important for the attachment of viral particles to host cells, but probably not for initiating viral uncoating, as is the case with canyon-binding receptors. Thus, a different cell entry mechanism must be used for enteroviruses that bind DAF."
9188637,Simian virus 40 T antigen can regulate p53-mediated transcription independent of binding p53.,"A simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen mutant containing only the N-terminal 136 amino acids, able to bind to Rb and p300 but not p53, partially inhibited p53-mediated transcription without affecting the ability of p53 to bind DNA. These results suggest that SV40 T antigen can regulate p53-mediated transcription either directly through protein-protein association or indirectly through interaction with factors which may function to confer p53-mediated transcription."
8381428,An interaction between replication protein A and SV40 T antigen appears essential for primosome assembly during SV40 DNA replication.,"Replication protein A from human cells (hRPA) is a multisubunit single-stranded DNA-binding protein (ssb) and is essential for SV40 DNA replication in vitro. The related RPA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (scRPA) is unable to substitute for hRPA in SV40 DNA replication. To understand this species specificity, we evaluated human and yeast RPA in enzymatic assays with SV40 T antigen (TAg) and human DNA polymerase alpha/primase, the factors essential for initiation of SV40 DNA replication. Both human and yeast RPA stimulated the polymerase and (at subsaturating levels of RPA) the primase activities of human DNA polymerase alpha/primase on homopolymer DNA templates. In contrast, both human and yeast RPA inhibited synthesis by DNA polymerase alpha/primase on natural single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) templates. T antigen reversed the inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha/primase activity on hRPA-coated natural ssDNA, as previously described, but was unable to reverse the inhibition on scRPA or Escherichia coli ssb-coated templates. Therefore, the ability of an ssb to reconstitute SV40 DNA replication correlated with its ability to allow the TAg stimulation of polymerase alpha/primase in this assay. Enzyme-linked immunoassays demonstrated that hRPA interacts with TAg, as previously described; however, scRPA does not bind to TAg in this assay. These and other recent results suggest that T antigen contains a function analogous to some prokaryotic DNA replication proteins that facilitate primosome assembly on ssb-coated template DNAs."
12383250,A nonphosphorylated 14-3-3 binding motif on exoenzyme S that is functional in vivo.,"14-3-3 proteins play an important role in a multitude of signalling pathways. The interactions between 14-3-3 and other signalling proteins, such as Raf and KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras), occur in a phospho-specific manner. Recently, a phosphorylation-independent interaction has been reported to occur between 14-3-3 and several proteins, for example 5-phosphatase, p75NTR-associated cell death executor (NADE) and the bacterial toxin Exoenzyme S (ExoS), an ADP-ribosyltransferase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study we have identified the amino acid residues on ExoS, which are responsible for its specific interaction with 14-3-3. Furthermore, we show that a peptide derived from ExoS, containing the 14-3-3 interaction site, effectively competes out the interaction between ExoS and 14-3-3. In addition, competition with this peptide blocks ExoS modification of Ras in our Ras modification assay. We show that the ExoS protein interacts with all isoforms of the 14-3-3 family tested. Moreover, in vivo an ExoS protein lacking the 14-3-3 binding site has a reduced capacity to ADP ribosylate cytoplasmic proteins, e.g. Ras, and shows a reduced capacity to change the morphology of infected cells."
11533668,Enteropathogenic E. coli Tir binds Nck to initiate actin pedestal formation in host cells.,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a bacterial pathogen that causes infantile diarrhea worldwide. EPEC injects a bacterial protein, translocated intimin receptor (Tir), into the host-cell plasma membrane where it acts as a receptor for the bacterial outer membrane protein, intimin. The interaction of Tir and intimin triggers a marked rearrangement of the host actin cytoskeleton into pedestals beneath adherent bacteria. On delivery into host cells, EPEC Tir is phosphorylated on tyrosine 474 of the intracellular carboxy-terminal domain, an event that is required for pedestal formation. Despite its essential role, the function of Tir tyrosine phosphorylation has not yet been elucidated. Here we show that tyrosine 474 of Tir directly binds the host-cell adaptor protein Nck, and that Nck is required for the recruitment of both neural Wiskott-Aldrich-syndrome protein (N-WASP) and the actin-related protein (Arp)2/3 complex to the EPEC pedestal, directly linking Tir to the cytoskeleton. Cells with null alleles of both mammalian Nck genes are resistant to the effects of EPEC on the actin cytoskeleton. These results implicate Nck adaptors as host-cell determinants of EPEC virulence."
7824954,Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators.,"TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism."
16319056,Divergence in the plasminogen-binding group a streptococcal M protein family: functional conservation of binding site and potential role for immune selection of variants.,"Group A streptococci (GAS) display receptors for the human zymogen plasminogen on the cell surface, one of which is the plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M protein (PAM). Characterization of PAM genes from 12 GAS isolates showed significant variation within the plasminogen-binding repeat motifs (a1/a2) of this protein. To determine the impact of sequence variation on protein function, recombinant proteins representing five naturally occurring variants of PAM, together with a recombinant M1 protein, were expressed and purified. Equilibrium dissociation constants for the interaction of PAM variants with biotinylated Glu-plasminogen ranged from 1.58 to 4.99 nm. Effective concentrations of prototype PAM required for 50% inhibition of plasminogen binding to immobilized PAM variants ranged from 0.68 to 22.06 nm. These results suggest that although variation in the a1/a2 region of the PAM protein does affect the comparative affinity of PAM variants, the functional capacity to bind plasminogen is conserved. Additionally, a potential role for the a1 region of PAM in eliciting a protective immune response was investigated by using a mouse model for GAS infection. The a1 region of PAM was found to protect immunized mice challenged with a PAM-positive GAS strain. These data suggest a link between selective immune pressure against the plasminogen-binding repeats and the functional conservation of the binding domain in PAM variants."
16424900,A rivet model for channel formation by aerolysin-like pore-forming toxins.,"The bacterial toxin aerolysin kills cells by forming heptameric channels, of unknown structure, in the plasma membrane. Using disulfide trapping and cysteine scanning mutagenesis coupled to thiol-specific labeling on lipid bilayers, we identify a loop that lines the channel. This loop has an alternating pattern of charged and uncharged residues, suggesting that the transmembrane region has a beta-barrel configuration, as observed for Staphylococcal alpha-toxin. Surprisingly, we found that the turn of the beta-hairpin is composed of a stretch of five hydrophobic residues. We show that this hydrophobic turn drives membrane insertion of the developing channel and propose that, once the lipid bilayer has been crossed, it folds back parallel to the plane of the membrane in a rivet-like fashion. This rivet-like conformation was modeled and sequence alignments suggest that such channel riveting may operate for many other pore-forming toxins."
17289036,Capping of actin filaments by vinculin activated by the Shigella IpaA carboxyl-terminal domain.,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, invades epithelial cells. Upon bacterial-cell contact, the type III bacterial effector IpaA binds to the cytoskeletal protein vinculin to promote actin reorganization required for efficient bacterial uptake. We show that the last 74 C-terminal residues of IpaA (A559) bind to human vinculin (HV) and promotes its association with actin filaments. Polymerisation experiments demonstrated that A559 was sufficient to induce HV-dependent partial capping of the barbed ends of actin filaments. These results suggest that IpaA regulates actin polymerisation/depolymerisation at sites of Shigella invasion by modulating the barbed end capping activity of vinculin."
16826238,"Structural mimicry for vinculin activation by IpaA, a virulence factor of Shigella flexneri.","Invasion of epithelial cells by Shigella flexneri is characterized by cytoskeletal rearrangements of the host cell membrane, promoting internalization of the bacterium. The bacterial effector IpaA is injected into the epithelial cell by a type III secretion apparatus and recruits vinculin to regulate actin polymerization at the site of entry. We analysed the complex formed between a carboxy-terminal fragment of IpaA (IpaA(560-633)) and the vinculin D1 domain (VD1), both in crystals and in solution. We present evidence that IpaA(560-633) has two alpha-helical vinculin-binding sites that simultaneously bind two VD1 molecules. The interaction of IpaA(560-633) with VD1 is highly similar to the interaction of the endogenous, eukaryotic proteins talin and alpha-actinin with VD1, showing that Shigella uses a structural mimicry strategy to activate vinculin."
18997778,Structure of the Shigella T3SS effector IpaH defines a new class of E3 ubiquitin ligases.,"IpaH proteins are E3 ubiquitin ligases delivered by the type III secretion apparatus into host cells upon infection of humans by the Gram-negative pathogen Shigella flexneri. These proteins comprise a variable leucine-rich repeat-containing N-terminal domain and a conserved C-terminal domain harboring an invariant cysteine residue that is crucial for activity. IpaH homologs are encoded by diverse animal and plant pathogens. Here we demonstrate that the IpaH C-terminal domain carries the catalytic activity for ubiquitin transfer and that the N-terminal domain carries the substrate specificity. The structure of the IpaH C-terminal domain, determined to 2.65-A resolution, represents an all-helical fold bearing no resemblance to previously defined E3 ubiquitin ligases. The conserved and essential cysteine residue lies on a flexible, surface-exposed loop surrounded by conserved acidic residues, two of which are crucial for IpaH activity."
14507921,Binding of anthrax toxin to its receptor is similar to alpha integrin-ligand interactions.,"The secreted protein toxin produced by Bacillus anthracis contributes to virulence of this pathogen and can cause many of the symptoms seen during an anthrax infection, including shock and sudden death. The cell-binding component of anthrax toxin, protective antigen, mediates entry of the toxin into cells by first binding directly to the extracellular integrin-like inserted (I) domain of the cellular anthrax toxin receptor, ATR. Here we report that this interaction requires an intact metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in the receptor as well as the presence of specific divalent cations. Also, we demonstrate that the toxin-receptor interaction is critically dependent on the Asp-683 carboxylate group of protective antigen, which projects from the receptor binding surface. We propose that this carboxylate group completes the coordination of the MIDAS metal of ATR, mimicking integrin-ligand interactions."
12011057,"Prominent role of the Ig-like V domain in trans-interactions of nectins. Nectin3 and nectin 4 bind to the predicted C-C'-C""-D beta-strands of the nectin1 V domain.","Nectins form a family of integral molecules that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Their ectodomain is made of three Ig-like domains (V, C, C). This family comprises at least five members, namely nectin1, -2, -3, -4, and poliovirus receptor (PVR), that are involved in different physiological and pathological processes. (i) Nectins are adhesion molecules localized at adherens junctions in epithelial cells. (ii) Some nectins act as poliovirus or alpha-herpesvirus receptors (nectin1). (iii) Nectin1 mutations are involved in orofacial developmental abnormalities in humans. Adhesion properties of nectins are mediated by Ca(2+)-independent homophilic and heterophilic processes through ectodomain trans-interactions. We have described a nectin trans-hetero-interaction network: nectin3 binds to nectin1, nectin2, and PVR; nectin1 also binds to nectin4. In the present study we compared the affinities of the different trans-interactions mediated by nectin1. We found that the K(D) of nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4 interactions is 1 and 100 nm, respectively, whereas the K(D) of the nectin1-mediated homophilic interaction is 1 microm. We show that nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4 trans-hetero-interactions were mediated through trans V to V domain interactions, whereas C domains contributed to increase the affinity of the interaction. Nectin3 and nectin4 share a common binding region in the nectin1 V domain: (i) nectin3 strongly competed with nectin4 binding, (ii) nectin3 and nectin4 binding to nectin1 was reduced by a number of monoclonal antibodies directed against the nectin1 V domain, and (iii) the glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus-1 that binds to the V domain of nectin1 reduced nectin3 and nectin4 binding. Finally, using chimeric nectin1/PVR receptors where PVR V domain beta-strands were substituted with the corresponding regions of nectin1, the nectin3 and nectin4 minimal binding region on nectin1 V domain was mapped to the C-C'-C""-D beta-strands."
15044490,"Binding stoichiometry and kinetics of the interaction of a human anthrax toxin receptor, CMG2, with protective antigen.","The protective antigen (PA) moiety of anthrax toxin binds to cellular receptors and mediates entry of the two enzymatic moieties of the toxin into the cytosol. Two PA receptors, anthrax toxin receptor (ATR)/tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2), have been identified. We expressed and purified the von Willebrand A (VWA) domain of CMG2 and examined its interactions with monomeric and heptameric forms of PA. Monomeric PA bound a stoichiometric equivalent of CMG2, whereas the heptameric prepore form bound 7 eq. The Kd of the VWA domain-PA interaction is 170 pm when liganded by Mg2+, reflecting a 1000-fold tighter interaction than most VWA domains with their endogenous ligands. The dissociation rate constant is extremely slow, indicating a 30-h lifetime for the CMG2.PA monomer complex. CMG2 metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) was studied kinetically and thermodynamically. The association rate constant (approximately 10(5) m(-1) s(-1)) is virtually identical in the presence or absence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ , but the dissociation rate of metal ion liganded complex is up to 4 orders of magnitude slower than metal ion free complex. Residual affinity (Kd approximately 960 nm) in the absence of divalent metal ions allowed the free energy for the contribution of the metal ion to be calculated as 5 kcal mol(-1), demonstrating that the metal ion-dependent adhesion site is directly coordinated by CMG2 and PA in the binding interface. The high affinity of the VWA domain for PA supports its potency in neutralizing anthrax toxin, demonstrating its potential utility as a novel therapeutic for anthrax."
16330538,"Human C4b-binding protein, structural basis for interaction with streptococcal M protein, a major bacterial virulence factor.","Human C4b-binding protein (C4BP) protects host tissue, and those pathogens able to hijack this plasma glycoprotein, from complement-mediated destruction. We now show that the first two complement control protein (CCP) modules of the C4BP alpha-chain, plus the four residues connecting them, are necessary and sufficient for binding a bacterial virulence factor, the Streptococcus pyogenes M4 (Arp4) protein. Structure determination by NMR reveals two tightly coupled CCP modules in an elongated arrangement within this region of C4BP. Chemical shift perturbation studies demonstrate that the N-terminal, hypervariable region of M4 binds to a site including strand 1 of CCP module 2. This interaction is accompanied by an intermodular reorientation within C4BP. We thus provide a detailed picture of an interaction whereby a pathogen evades complement."
17529992,Structural and biochemical insights into the regulation of protein phosphatase 2A by small t antigen of SV40.,"The small t antigen (ST) of DNA tumor virus SV40 facilitates cellular transformation by disrupting the functions of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) through a poorly defined mechanism. The crystal structure of the core domain of SV40 ST bound to the scaffolding subunit of human PP2A reveals that the ST core domain has a novel zinc-binding fold and interacts with the conserved ridge of HEAT repeats 3-6, which overlaps with the binding site for the B' (also called PR61 or B56) regulatory subunit. ST has a lower binding affinity than B' for the PP2A core enzyme. Consequently, ST does not efficiently displace B' from PP2A holoenzymes in vitro. Notably, ST inhibits PP2A phosphatase activity through its N-terminal J domain. These findings suggest that ST may function mainly by inhibiting the phosphatase activity of the PP2A core enzyme, and to a lesser extent by modulating assembly of the PP2A holoenzymes."
7868247,Pneumocystis carinii glycoprotein A binds macrophage mannose receptors.,"Pneumocystis carinii causes life-threatening pneumonia in patients with impaired immunity. Recent studies suggest that alveolar macrophages interact with P. carinii through macrophage mannose receptors. However, the ligand(s) on P. carinii that is recognized by these receptors has not been fully defined. P. carinii contains a major mannose-rich surface antigen complex termed glycoprotein A (gpA). It was therefore hypothesized that gpA binds directly to macrophage mannose receptors and mediates organism attachment to these phagocytes. To assess this, gpA was purified from P. carinii by continuous-elution gel electrophoresis. 125I-labeled gpA bound to alveolar macrophages in a saturable fashion. In addition, gpA binding was substantially inhibited by both alpha-mannan and EDTA, further suggesting that gpA interacts with macrophage mannose receptors. Macrophage membrane proteins capable of binding to gpA were isolated with a gpA-Sepharose column. A 165-kDa membrane-associated protein was specifically eluted from the gpA-Sepharose column with EDTA (20 mM). This protein was identified as the macrophage mannose receptor by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-mannose receptor antiserum. To further investigate the role of gpA in P. carinii-macrophage interactions, 51Cr-labeled P. carinii cells were incubated with macrophages in the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble gpA, and organism attachment was quantified. Soluble gpA (2.5 mg/dl) competitively inhibited P. carinii attachment to alveolar macrophages by 51.3% +/- 3.7% (P = 0.01). Our findings demonstrate that gpA present on P. carinii interacts directly with mannose receptors, thereby mediating organism attachment to alveolar macrophages."
18252829,Structure and mechanism of IFN-gamma antagonism by an orthopoxvirus IFN-gamma-binding protein.,"Ectromelia virus (ECTV) encodes an IFN-gamma-binding protein (IFN-gammaBP(ECTV)) that disrupts IFN-gamma signaling and its ability to induce an antiviral state within cells. IFN-gammaBP(ECTV) is an important virulence factor that is highly conserved (>90%) in all orthopoxviruses, including variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. The 2.2-A crystal structure of the IFN-gammaBP(ECTV)/IFN-gamma complex reveals IFN-gammaBP(ECTV) consists of an IFN-gammaR1 ligand-binding domain and a 57-aa helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif that is structurally related to the transcription factor TFIIA. The HTH motif forms a tetramerization domain that results in an IFN-gammaBP(ECTV)/IFN-gamma complex containing four IFN-gammaBP(ECTV) chains and two IFN-gamma dimers. The structure, combined with biochemical and cell-based assays, demonstrates that IFN-gammaBP(ECTV) tetramers are required for efficient IFN-gamma antagonism."
17174309,Identification of the WW domain-interaction sites in the unstructured N-terminal domain of EBV LMP 2A.,"Epstein-Barr virus latency is maintained by the latent membrane protein (LMP) 2A, which mimics the B-cell receptor (BCR) and perturbs BCR signaling. The cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of LMP2A is composed of 119 amino acids. The N-terminal domain of LMP2A (LMP2A NTD) contains two PY motifs (PPPPY) that interact with the WW domains of Nedd4 family ubiquitin-protein ligases. Based on our analysis of NMR data, we found that the LMP2A NTD adopts an overall random-coil structure in its native state. However, the region between residues 60 and 90 was relatively ordered, and seemed to form the hydrophobic core of the LMP2A NTD. This region resides between two PY motifs and is important for WW domain binding. Mapping of the residues involved in the interaction between the LMP2A NTD and WW domains was achieved by chemical shift perturbation, by the addition of WW2 and WW3 peptides. Interestingly, the binding of the WW domains mainly occurred in the hydrophobic core of the LMP2A NTD. In addition, we detected a difference in the binding modes of the two PY motifs against the two WW peptides. The binding of the WW3 peptide caused the resonances of five residues (Tyr(60), Glu(61), Asp(62), Trp(65), and Gly(66)) just behind the N-terminal PY motif of the LMP2A NTD to disappear. A similar result was obtained with WW2 binding. However, near the C-terminal PY motif, the chemical shift perturbation caused by WW2 binding was different from that due to WW3 binding, indicating that the residues near the PY motifs are involved in selective binding of WW domains. The present work represents the first structural study of the LMP2A NTD and provides fundamental structural information about its interaction with ubiquitin-protein ligase."
16000308,Novel interaction partners of the CD2BP2-GYF domain.,"The GYF domain of CD2BP2 serves as an adapter that recognizes proline-rich sequences in intracellular proteins. Although the T cell adhesion molecule CD2 and the core splicing protein SmB/B' were previously shown to interact with CD2BP2-GYF, we are now using a general approach to identify putative GYF domain target sites within the human proteome. The phage display-derived recognition motif for CD2BP2-GYF is PPG(W/F/Y/M/L). SPOT analysis confirmed that the GYF domain interacts with peptides from human proteins containing the consensus site. Epitope mapping by NMR spectroscopy performed for several peptides revealed a conserved binding surface. A direct interaction of the CD2BP2-GYF domain with the novel protein interaction partners PI31 and NPWBP was verified by yeast two-hybrid analysis."
12086624,Recognition of eIF4G by rotavirus NSP3 reveals a basis for mRNA circularization.,"Rotaviruses, segmented double-stranded RNA viruses, co-opt the eukaryotic translation machinery with the aid of nonstructural protein 3 (NSP3), a rotaviral functional homolog of the cellular poly(A) binding protein (PABP). NSP3 binds to viral mRNA 3' consensus sequences and circularizes mRNA via interactions with eIF4G. Here, we present the X-ray structure of the C-terminal domain of NSP3 (NSP3-C) recognizing a fragment of eIF4GI. Homodimerization of NSP3-C yields a symmetric, elongated, largely alpha-helical structure with two hydrophobic eIF4G binding pockets at the dimer interface. Site-directed mutagenesis and isothermal titration calorimetry documented that NSP3 and PABP use analogous eIF4G recognition strategies, despite marked differences in tertiary structure."
16249186,Structure of the human Papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein and its mechanism for inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor.,"The E7 oncoprotein from human Papillomavirus (HPV) mediates cell transformation in part by binding to the human pRb tumor suppressor protein and E2F transcription factors, resulting in the dissociation of pRb from E2F transcription factors and the premature cell progression into the S-phase of the cell cycle. This activity is mediated by the LXCXE motif and the CR3 zinc binding domain of the E7 protein. In this study we report the x-ray crystal structure of the CR3 region of HPV E7 and a structure-based mutational analysis to investigate its mode of pRb and E2F binding and E2F displacement from pRb. The structure reveals a novel zinc-bound E7-CR3 obligate homodimer that contains two surface patches of sequence conservation. Mutation of residues within these patches reveals that one patch is required for pRb binding, whereas the other is required for E2F binding. We also show that both E7-mediated interactions are required to disrupt pRb.E2F complexes. Based on these studies we present a mechanistic model for how E7 displaces E2F from pRb. Because the CR3 region of HPV E7 has no detectable homology to other human proteins, the structure-function studies presented here provide an avenue for developing small molecule compounds that inhibit HPV-E7-mediated cell transformation."
17540176,The tumor suppressor PP2A Abeta regulates the RalA GTPase.,"The serine-threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric enzyme family that regulates numerous signaling pathways. Biallelic mutations of the structural PP2A Abeta subunit occur in several types of human tumors; however, the functional consequences of these cancer-associated PP2A Abeta mutations in cell transformation remain undefined. Here we show that suppression of PP2A Abeta expression permits immortalized human cells to achieve a tumorigenic state. Cancer-associated Abeta mutants fail to reverse tumorigenic phenotype induced by PP2A Abeta suppression, indicating that these mutants function as null alleles. Wild-type PP2A Abeta but not cancer-derived Abeta mutants form a complex with the small GTPase RalA. PP2A Abeta-containing complexes dephosphorylate RalA at Ser183 and Ser194, inactivating RalA and abolishing its transforming function. These observations identify PP2A Abeta as a tumor suppressor gene that transforms immortalized human cells by regulating the function of RalA."
17981117,Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein promotes the development of the liver stages of the parasite.,"The liver stages of malaria are clinically silent but have a central role in the Plasmodium life cycle. Liver stages of the parasite containing thousands of merozoites grow inside hepatocytes for several days without triggering an inflammatory response. We show here that Plasmodium uses a PEXEL/VTS motif to introduce the circumsporozoite (CS) protein into the hepatocyte cytoplasm and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to enter its nucleus. CS outcompetes NFkappaB nuclear import, thus downregulating the expression of many genes controlled by NFkappaB, including those involved in inflammation. CS also influences the expression of over one thousand host genes involved in diverse metabolic processes to create a favorable niche for the parasite growth. The presence of CS in the hepatocyte enhances parasite growth of the liver stages in vitro and in vivo. These findings have far reaching implications for drug and vaccine development against the liver stages of the malaria parasite."
8388547,Analysis of a protein-binding domain of p53.,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 was first isolated as a simian virus 40 large T antigen-associated protein and subsequently was found to function in cell proliferation control. Tumor-derived mutations in p53 occur predominantly in four evolutionarily conserved regions spanning approximately 50% of the polypeptide. Previously, three of these regions were identified as essential for T-antigen binding. We have examined the interaction between p53 and T antigen by using Escherichia coli-expressed human p53. By a combination of deletion analysis and antibody inhibition studies, a region of p53 that is both necessary and sufficient for binding to T antigen has been localized. This function is contained within residues 94 to 293, which include the four conserved regions affected by mutation in tumors. Residues 94 to 293 of p53 were expressed in both wild-type and mutant forms. T-antigen binding was unaffected by tumor-derived mutations which have been associated with the wild-type conformation of p53 but was greatly reduced by mutations which were previously shown to alter p53 conformation. Our results show that, like T-antigen binding to the Rb tumor suppressor protein, T antigen appears to interact with the domain of p53 that is commonly mutated in human tumors."
8551580,The major transcriptional transactivation domain of simian virus 40 large T antigen associates nonconcurrently with multiple components of the transcriptional preinitiation complex.,"Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (Tag) is a promiscuous transcriptional transactivator; however, its mechanism of transactivation remains unknown. Recent studies have suggested the possible involvement of protein-protein interactions with TBP, the TATA box-binding protein of TFIID, and TEF-1, an enhancer-binding factor. We show here that (i) the Tag domain containing amino acids 133 to 249 directly interacts with the general transcription factor TFIIB, the activator protein Sp1, and the 140-kDa subunit of RNA polymerase II, as well as with TBP and TEF-1; (ii) these interactions can also occur when these transcription factors are present in their functional states in cellular extracts; (iii) binding of Tag to TBP is eliminated by preincubation of TBP either at 48 degrees C or with the adenovirus 13S E1a protein; (iv) this domain of Tag cannot bind concurrently to more than one of these transcription factors; and (v) the substitution of Tag amino acid residues 173 and 174 inactivates the ability of this Tag domain both to associate with any of these transcription factors and to transactivate the SV40 late promoter. Thus, we conclude that SV40 Tag probably does not transactivate via the concurrent interaction with multiple components of the preinitiation complex. Rather, we hypothesize that transactivation by Tag may primarily occur by removing or preventing the binding of factors that inhibit the formation of preinitiation complexes."
12368347,Cooperative activation of human papillomavirus type 8 gene expression by the E2 protein and the cellular coactivator p300.,"The E2 proteins of papillomaviruses (PV) bind to the coactivator CBP/p300 as do many other transcription factors, but the precise role of CBP/p300 in E2-specific functions is not yet understood. We show that the E2 protein of human PV type 8 (HPV8) directly binds to p300. Activation of HPV8 gene expression by low amounts of HPV8 E2 was stimulated up to sevenfold by coexpression of p300. The interaction between E2 and p300 may play a role in differentiation-dependent activation of PV gene expression, since we can show that the expression level of p300 increases during keratinocyte differentiation. Surprisingly, sequence-specific binding of E2 to its recognition sites within the regulatory region of HPV8 is not necessary for this cooperation, indicating that E2 can be recruited to the promoter via protein-protein interaction. HPV8 E2 binds via its N-terminal activation domain (AD), its C-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD), and its internal hinge region to p300 in vitro. Transient-transfection assays revealed that the AD is necessary and sufficient for cooperative activation with p300. However, we provide evidence that the interaction of the hinge and the DBD of HPV8 E2 with p300 may contribute. Our data suggest an important role of p300 in regulation of HPV8 gene expression and reveal a new mechanism by which E2 may be recruited to a promoter to activate transcription without sequence specific DNA binding."
14747526,Recruitment of replication protein A by the papillomavirus E1 protein and modulation by single-stranded DNA.,"With the exception of viral proteins E1 and E2, papillomaviruses depend heavily on host replication machinery for replication of their viral genome. E1 and E2 are known to recruit many of the necessary cellular replication factors to the viral origin of replication. Previously, we reported a physical interaction between E1 and the major human single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein, replication protein A (RPA). E1 was determined to bind to the 70-kDa subunit of RPA, RPA70. In this study, using E1-affinity coprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based interaction assays, we show that E1 interacts with the major ssDNA-binding domain of RPA. Consistent with our previous report, no measurable interaction between E1 and the two smaller subunits of RPA was detected. The interaction of E1 with RPA was substantially inhibited by ssDNA. The extent of this inhibition was dependent on the length of the DNA. A 31-nucleotide (nt) oligonucleotide strongly inhibited the E1-RPA interaction, while a 16-nt oligonucleotide showed an intermediate level of inhibition. In contrast, a 10-nt oligonucleotide showed no observable effect on the E1-RPA interaction. This inhibition was not dependent on the sequence of the DNA. Furthermore, ssDNA also inhibited the interaction of RPA with papillomavirus E2, simian virus 40 T antigen, human polymerase alpha-primase, and p53. Taken together, our results suggest a potential role for ssDNA in modulating RPA-protein interactions, in particular, the RPA-E1 interactions during papillomavirus DNA replication. A model for recruitment of RPA by E1 during papillomavirus DNA replication is proposed."
10233951,"Interactions of the papovavirus DNA replication initiator proteins, bovine papillomavirus type 1 E1 and simian virus 40 large T antigen, with human replication protein A.","Papovaviruses utilize predominantly cellular DNA replication proteins to replicate their own viral genomes. To appropriate the cellular DNA replication machinery, simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (Tag) binds to three different cellular replication proteins, the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex, the replication protein A (RPA) complex, and topoisomerase I. The functionally similar papillomavirus E1 protein has also been shown to bind to the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex. Enzyme-linked immunoassay-based protein interaction assays and protein affinity pull-down assays were used to show that the papillomavirus E1 protein also binds to the cellular RPA complex in vitro. Furthermore, SV40 Tag was able to compete with bovine papillomavirus type 1 E1 for binding to RPA. Each of the three RPA subunits was individually overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble fusion protein. These fusion proteins were used to show that the E1-RPA and Tag-RPA interactions are primarily mediated through the 70-kDa subunit of RPA. These results suggest that different viruses have evolved similar mechanisms for taking control of the cellular DNA replication machinery."
7815540,Simian virus 40 large T antigen affects the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle and interacts with p34CDC28.,"Simian virus 40 tumor (T) antigen, an established viral oncoprotein, causes alterations in cell growth control through interacting with, and altering the function of, cellular proteins. To examine the effects of T antigen on cell growth control, and to identify the cellular proteins with which it may functionally interact, T antigen was expressed in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast cells expressing T antigen showed morphological alterations as well as growth inhibition attributable, at least in part, to a lag in progression from G1 to S. This point in the cell cycle is also known to be affected by T antigen in mammalian cells. Both p34CDC28 and p34CDC2Hs were shown to bind to a chimeric T antigen-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, indicating that T antigen interacts directly with cell cycle proteins which control the G1 to S transition. This interaction was confirmed by in vivo cross-linking experiments, in which T antigen and p34CDC28 were coimmunoprecipitated from extracts of T-antigen-expressing yeast cells. These immunoprecipitated complexes could phosphorylate histone H1, indicating that kinase activity was retained. In addition, in autophosphorylation reactions, the complexes phosphorylated a novel 60-kDa protein which appeared to be underphosphorylated (or underrepresented) in p34CDC28-containing complexes from cells which did not express T antigen. These results suggest that T antigen interacts with p34CDC28 and alters the kinase function of p34CDC28-containing complexes. These events correlate with alterations in the yeast cell cycle at the G1 to S transition."
8551581,Interaction between T antigen and TEA domain of the factor TEF-1 derepresses simian virus 40 late promoter in vitro: identification of T-antigen domains important for transcription control.,"The large tumor antigen (TAg) of simian virus 40 regulates transcription of the viral genes. The early promoter is repressed when TAg binds to the origin and DNA replication begins, whereas the late promoter is activated by TAg through both replication-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Previously it was shown that activation is diminished when a site in the viral enhancer to which the factor TEF-1 binds is disrupted. We show here that the NH2-terminal region of TAg binds to the TEA domain of TEF-1, a DNA binding domain also found in the Drosophila scalloped and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TEC1 proteins. The interaction inhibits DNA binding by TEF-1 and activates transcription in vitro from a subset of naturally occurring late start sites. These sites are also activated by mutations in the DNA motifs to which TEF-1 binds. Therefore, TEF-1 appears to function as a repressor of late transcription, and its involvement in the early-to-late shift in viral transcription is discussed. The mutation of Ser-189 in TAg, which reduces transformation efficiency in certain assays, disrupts the interaction with TEF-1. Thus, TEF-1 might also regulate genes involved in growth control."
8423815,Transcriptional activation by simian virus 40 large T antigen: interactions with multiple components of the transcription complex.,"Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen is a potent transcriptional activator of both viral and cellular promoters. Within the SV40 late promoter, a specific upstream element necessary for T-antigen transcriptional activation is the binding site for transcription-enhancing factor 1 (TEF-1). The promoter structure necessary for T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation appears to be simple. For example, a promoter consisting of upstream TEF-1 binding sites (or other factor-binding sites) and a downstream TATA or initiator element is efficiently activated. It has been demonstrated that transcriptional activation by T antigen does not require direct binding to the DNA; thus, the most direct effect that T antigen could have on these simple promoters would be through protein-protein interactions with either upstream-bound transcription factors, the basal transcription complex, or both. To determine whether such interactions occur, full-length T antigen or segments of it was fused to the glutathione-binding site (GST fusions) or to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1 to 147) (Gal4 fusions). With the GST fusions, it was found that TEF-1 and the TATA-binding protein (TBP) bound different regions of T antigen. A GST fusion containing amino acids 5 to 172 (region T1) efficiently bound TBP. TEF-1 bound neither region T1 nor a region between amino acids 168 and 373 (region T2); however, it bound efficiently to the combined region (T5) containing amino acids 5 to 383.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9882311,Interaction of the transcription factor TFIID with simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen interferes with replication of SV40 DNA in vitro.,"Simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor (T) antigen is the major regulatory protein that directs the course of viral infection, primarily by interacting with host cell proteins and modulating their functions. Initiation of viral DNA replication requires specific interactions of T antigen bound to the viral origin of DNA replication with cellular replication proteins. Transcription factors are thought to stimulate initiation of viral DNA replication, but the mechanism of stimulation is poorly understood. Since the transcription factor TATA-binding protein (TBP) binds to sequences within the origin of replication and interacts specifically with T antigen, we examined whether TBP complexes stimulate SV40 DNA replication in vitro. On the contrary, we found that depletion of TBP complexes from human cell extracts increased their ability to support viral DNA replication, and readdition of TBP complexes to the depleted extracts diminished their activity. We have mapped the sites of interaction between the proteins to residues 181 to 205 of T antigen and 184 to 220 of TBP. Titration of fusion proteins containing either of these peptides into undepleted cell extracts stimulated their replication activity, suggesting that they prevented the T antigen-TBP interaction that interfered with replication activity. TBP complexes also interfered with origin DNA unwinding by purified T antigen, and addition of either the T antigen or the TBP fusion peptide relieved the inhibition. These results suggest that TBP complexes associate with a T-antigen surface that is also required for origin DNA unwinding and viral DNA replication. We speculate that competition among cellular proteins for T antigen may play a role in regulating the course of viral infection."
12186919,Interaction of the Vp3 nuclear localization signal with the importin alpha 2/beta heterodimer directs nuclear entry of infecting simian virus 40.,"For nuclear entry of large nucleoprotein complexes, it is thought that one key nuclear localization signal (NLS) of a protein component becomes exposed to mediate importin recognition. We show that the nuclear entry of simian virus 40 involves a dynamic interplay between two distinct interiorly situated capsid NLSs, the Vp1 NLS and the Vp3 NLS, and the selective exposure and importin recognition of the Vp3 NLS. The Vp3 NLS-null mutants assembled normally into virion-like particles (VLP) in mutant DNA-transfected cells. When used to infect a new host, the null VLP entered the cell normally but was impaired in viral DNA nuclear entry due to a lack of recognition by the importin alpha 2/beta heterodimer, leading to reduced viability. Both Vp3 and Vp1 NLSs directed importin interaction in vitro, but the Vp1 NLS, which overlaps the Vp1 DNA binding domain, did not bind importins in the presence of DNA. The results suggest that certain canonical NLSs within a nucleoprotein complex, such as the Vp1 NLS, can be masked from functioning by binding to the nucleic acid component and that the availability of an NLS that is not masked and can become exposed for importin binding, such as the Vp3 NLS, is a general feature of the nuclear entry of the nucleoprotein complexes, including those of other animal viruses."
12634384,The abundant nuclear enzyme PARP participates in the life cycle of simian virus 40 and is stimulated by minor capsid protein VP3.,"The abundant nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) functions in DNA damage surveillance and repair and at the decision between apoptosis and necrosis. Here we show that PARP binds to simian virus 40 (SV40) capsid proteins VP1 and VP3. Furthermore, its enzymatic activity is stimulated by VP3 but not by VP1. Experiments with purified mutant proteins demonstrated that the PARP binding domain in VP3 is localized to the 35 carboxy-terminal amino acids, while a larger peptide of 49 amino acids was required for full stimulation of its activity. The addition of 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), a known competitive inhibitor of PARP, demonstrated that PARP participates in the SV40 life cycle. The titer of SV40 propagated on CV-1 cells was reduced by 3-AB in a dose-dependent manner. Additional experiments showed that 3-AB did not affect viral DNA replication or capsid protein production. PARP did not modify the viral capsid proteins in in vitro poly(ADP-ribosylation) assays, implying that it does not affect SV40 infectivity. On the other hand, it greatly reduced the magnitude of the host cytopathic effects, a hallmark of SV40 infection. Additional experiments suggested that the stimulation of PARP activity by VP3 leads the infected cell to a necrotic pathway, characterized by the loss of membrane integrity, thus facilitating the release of mature SV40 virions from the cells. Our studies identified a novel function of the minor capsid protein VP3 in the recruitment of PARP for the SV40 lytic process."
7666533,"Bovine papillomavirus type 1 E2 transcriptional regulators directly bind two cellular transcription factors, TFIID and TFIIB.","The bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E2 translational open reading frame encodes three proteins that regulate viral transcription and DNA replication: the E2 transcriptional activator (E2TA), the E2 transcriptional repressor (E2TR) and the E8/E2 transcriptional repressor (E8/E2TR). E2TA is a strong activator of papillomaviral promoters and is required for viral DNA replication. E2TR and E8/E2TR inhibit the activities of E2TA but also possess weak transactivational properties of their own. Two components of the cellular transcription apparatus, TFIID and TFIIB, have previously been shown to associate with other viral and cellular transcriptional activators. We present evidence here that E2TA, the full-length E2 open reading frame gene product, directly binds both of these transcription factors in vitro. Glutathione S-transferase E2TA (GST-E2TA) fusion protein bound in vitro-synthesized TATA-box-binding protein (TBP), a component of TFIID, and in vitro-synthesized TFIIB. Likewise, GST-E2TA bound TFIID and TFIIB present in a nuclear extract from the human cervical cancer-derived cell line, HeLa. The binding of GST-E2TA to TBP and TFIIB required no additional mammalian factors, as shown by direct binding of GST-E2TA to bacterially synthesized recombinant TBP and recombinant TFIIB. The domain of E2TA required for its interaction with both TBP and TFIIB was localized to the C terminus of E2TA, a region also present in E2TR and E8/E2TR. This domain lies within the region of E2TA previously shown to confer cooperative DNA binding by E2TA and TBP and overlaps with the region of E2TA required for DNA binding and dimerization. Our findings, taken in context with previous studies, lead us to conclude that (i) cooperative DNA binding by E2 proteins and TBP is likely mediated by the direct binding of E2 proteins to TBP, (ii) the weak transcriptional transactivation by E2TR and E8/E2TR may result as a consequence of direct TBP and TFIIB binding by these proteins, and (iii) TBP and/or TFIIB binding may be required but is not sufficient for E2TA's strong transactivational activity."
9466902,The SV40 capsid protein VP3 cooperates with the cellular transcription factor Sp1 in DNA-binding and in regulating viral promoter activity.,"Chromatin structure and protein-protein interactions play an important role in eukaryotic gene function. Nucleosomal rearrangement at the simian virus 40 (SV40) regulatory region occurs at the late stages of the viral life cycle preceding viral assembly. The SV40 capsid proteins are required for this nucleosomal rearrangement suggesting that they participate in turning-off the viral promoters. In aiming to elucidate the role of the capsid proteins in gene regulation, we studied the interaction between VP3, an internal capsid protein, and the cellular transcription factor Sp1, a major regulator of both the early and late viral promoters. Our results showed that VP3 repressed transcription from the viral early promoter in vitro. We found significant cooperativity between Sp1 and VP3 in specific DNA-binding to the Sp1 binding site. In addition, protein-protein interactions between VP3 and Sp1 in the absence of DNA were observed. These findings have led us to conclude that the novel host-viral Sp1-VP3 complex down regulates viral transcription and further suggest that Sp1 participates in recruiting VP3 to the SV40 minichromosome in SV40 assembly."
12021324,"Cellular transcription factor Sp1 recruits simian virus 40 capsid proteins to the viral packaging signal, ses.","Simian virus 40 (SV40) capsid assembly occurs in the nucleus. All three capsid proteins bind DNA nonspecifically, raising the dilemma of how they attain specificity to the SV40 minichromosome in the presence of a large excess of genomic DNA. The SV40 packaging signal, ses, which is required for assembly, is composed of multiple DNA elements that bind transcription factor Sp1. Our previous studies showed that Sp1 participates in SV40 assembly and that it cooperates in DNA binding with VP2/3. We hypothesized that Sp1 recruits the capsid proteins to the viral minichromosome, conferring upon them specific DNA recognition. Here, we have tested the hypothesis. Computer analysis showed that the combination of six tandem GC boxes at ses is not found at cellular promoters and therefore is unique to SV40. Cooperativity in DNA binding between Sp1 and VP2/3 was not abolished at even a 1,000-fold excess of cellular DNA, providing strong support for the recruitment hypothesis. Sp1 also binds VP1 and cooperates with VP1 in DNA binding. VP1 pentamers (VP1(5)) avidly interact with VP2/3, utilizing the same VP2/3 domain as described for polyomavirus. We conclude that VP1(5)-VP2/3 building blocks are recruited by Sp1 to ses, where they form the nucleation center for capsid assembly. By this mechanism the virus ensures that capsid formation is initiated at a single site around its minichromosome. Sp1 enhances the formation of SV40 pseudovirions in vitro, providing additional support for the model. Analyses of Sp1 and VP3 deletion mutants showed that Sp1 and VP2/3 bind one another and cooperate in DNA binding through their DNA-binding domains, with additional contacts outside these domains. VP1 contacts Sp1 at residues outside the Sp1 DNA-binding domain. These and additional data allowed us to propose a molecular model for the VP1(5)-VP2/3-DNA-Sp1 complex."
7624774,Interaction of papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins with a putative calcium-binding protein.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with the majority of cervical cancers and encode a transforming protein, E6, that interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. Because E6 has p53-independent transforming activity, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for other E6-binding proteins. One such protein, E6BP, interacted with cancer-associated HPV E6 and with bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E6. The transforming activity of BPV-1 E6 mutants correlated with their E6BP-binding ability. E6BP is identical to a putative calcium-binding protein, ERC-55, that appears to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum."
12444549,Chimaeric HPV E6 proteins allow dissection of the proteolytic pathways regulating different E6 cellular target proteins.,"The ability of HPV E6 oncoproteins to induce the degradation of PDZ domain-containing MAGUK proteins correlates with their malignant potential. We previously showed that the HPV-6 E6 protein, when provided with the PDZ-binding domain from HPV-18 E6, acquires the ability to bind the Discs Large (Dlg) tumour suppressor and target it for degradation. Based on this finding we have extended this analysis to E6 proteins from a variety of different papillomavirus types. Cloning a PDZ-binding sequence onto the C-terminus of E6 proteins derived from low-risk mucosal, and low and high-risk cutaneous papillomavirus types, enables them to bind Dlg and a second MAGUK family member, MAGI-1. This renders the mucosally-derived low-risk chimaeric HPV E6 proteins capable of targeting Dlg for degradation, but they are unable to induce significant levels of degradation of MAGI-1. In contrast, none of the E6 proteins derived from cutaneous papillomavirus types induce significant degradation of either MAGI-1 or Dlg when provided with a PDZ-binding domain. These results demonstrate significant differences, both between mucosal and cutaneous HPV E6 proteins and in the pathways required for Dlg and MAGI-1 degradation."
15564746,Specific in vitro interaction between papillomavirus E2 proteins and TBP-associated factors.,"The bovine and human papillomavirus (BPV/HPV) E2 proteins bind specifically to palindromic sequences ACCGN4CGGT that are concentrated within the viral long control region, where they regulate viral oncogene transcription. E2 can activate viral promoters over relatively large distances within the viral genome and was shown to cooperate with a number of cellular transcription factors. Transcriptional activator proteins, such as E2, are thought to act, at least in part, by influencing the assembly and/or stability of preinitiation complexes and it has been suggested that the transcription factor IID, composed by the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and numerous TBP-associated factors (TAFs), is a possible target of this important viral protein. In this paper, we demonstrate that E2 proteins associate in vitro with several TAFs, in particular with TAFII250 and TAFII80. In addition, we observed that the association of TAFII250 with BPV1 E2 is stronger than with HPV18 E2 and that the carboxy terminal domain of both viral proteins is involved in this interaction. On the other hand, TAFII80 binds with similar strength to both E2 proteins through their amino terminal region. These observations may help to explain the different behavior of bovine and human E2 proteins, since BPV E2 is a stronger transcriptional activator than HPV18 E2."
11042264,Direct binding of hepatitis B virus X protein and retinoid X receptor contributes to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transactivation.,"The X gene product of the human hepatitis B virus (HBx), a major factor responsible for hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, modulates transactivation by a variety of transcription factors. Herein, expression of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene was found to be regulated transcriptionally by HBx through two distinct promoter regions. The cAMP response element (CRE)-1 site within the proximal promoter region mediated the HBx-induced transactivation of the PEPCK gene through C/EBP alpha and ATF-2. A retinoid X receptor (RXR) response element within the distal promoter region also contributed to the HBx-induced transactivation. Consistent with these results, HBx directly interacted with RXR, and the interaction interfaces were localized to the transactivation domain of HBx and the ligand binding domain of RXR."
12963047,Interaction of hepatitis C virus NS5A with La protein revealed by T7 phage display.,"Although the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome is synthesized by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, other viral and cellular factors are assumed to be required for template-specific initiation and regulation of RNA-synthesis. The cellular protein La, which normally associates with RNA polymerase III transcripts, also interacts with the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of several RNA viruses, including HCV. To investigate whether other viral gene products may be involved in this interaction, we constructed an HCV cDNA expression library in bacteriophage T7 allowing portions of the HCV polyprotein to be displayed on the phage surface. Screening of the phage library against La resulted in selection of clones displaying the N-terminal region of HCV NS5A. Co-precipitation of full-length and truncated forms of recombinant NS5A with La revealed that the N-terminal region of NS5A was both necessary and sufficient for binding to La. Although this region of NS5A is essential for HCV replication, the role of the NS5A-La interaction in the infected cell remains to be established."
10924497,Hepatitis C virus core protein enhances p53 function through augmentation of DNA binding affinity and transcriptional ability.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes a persistent infection, chronic hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since there are several reports indicating that some viruses influence the tumor suppressor p53 function, we determined the effects of HCV proteins on p53 function and its mechanism determined by use of a reporter assay. Among seven HCV proteins investigated (core, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B), only core protein augmented the transcriptional activity of p53 and increased the expression of p21(waf1) protein, which is a major target of p53. Core protein increased both DNA-binding affinity of p53 in electrophoretic morbidity shift assay and transcriptional ability of p53 itself in a reporter assay. The direct interaction between core protein and C terminus of p53 was also shown by glutathione S-transferase fusion protein binding assay. In addition, core protein interacted with hTAF(II)28, a component of the transcriptional factor complex in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that HCV core protein interacts with p53 and modulates p53-dependent promoter activities during HCV infection."
8221891,Drosophila TAFII40 interacts with both a VP16 activation domain and the basal transcription factor TFIIB.,"Enhancement of RNA polymerase II transcription by the viral transactivator VP16 requires the TFIID complex, which consists of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here we report the molecular cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of Drosophila TAFII40 (dTAFII40), a subunit of TFIID. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays revealed direct binding between dTAFII40 and a 39 amino acid VP16 activation domain. In addition, affinity chromatography indicated a direct binding of the basal factor TFIIB to immobilized dTAFII40. Since VP16 also binds TFIIB, our results suggest a ternary interaction among an activator, a coactivator, and a basal transcription factor. Antibodies directed against dTAFII40 inhibited activation by GAL4-VP16 without affecting basal transcription. These results, taken together with previous studies of Sp1 and dTAFII110, establish that different activators interact with distinct TAFs in the TFIID complex and that TAFs can contact both activators and basal factors."
18587047,Integrins alpha1beta1 and alpha2beta1 are receptors for the rotavirus enterotoxin.,"Rotavirus NSP4 is a viral enterotoxin capable of causing diarrhea in neonatal mice. This process is initiated by the binding of extracellular NSP4 to target molecule(s) on the cell surface that triggers a signaling cascade leading to diarrhea. We now report that the integrins alpha1beta1 and alpha2beta1 are receptors for NSP4. NSP4 specifically binds to the alpha1 and alpha2 I domains with apparent K(d) = 1-2.7 muM. Binding is mediated by the I domain metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif, requires Mg(2+) or Mn(2+), is abolished with EDTA, and an NSP4 point mutant, E(120)A, fails to bind alpha2 integrin I domain. NSP4 has two distinct integrin interaction domains. NSP4 amino acids 114-130 are essential for binding to the I domain, and NSP4 peptide 114-135 blocks binding of the natural ligand, collagen I, to integrin alpha2. NSP4 amino acids 131-140 are not associated with the initial binding to the I domain, but elicit signaling that leads to the spreading of attached C2C12-alpha2 cells, mouse myoblast cells stably expressing the human alpha2 integrin. NSP4 colocalizes with integrin alpha2 on the basolateral surface of rotavirus-infected polarized intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells as well as surrounding noninfected cells. NSP4 mutants that fail to bind or signal through integrin alpha2 were attenuated in diarrhea induction in neonatal mice. These results indicate that NSP4 interaction with integrin alpha1 and alpha2 is an important component of enterotoxin function and rotavirus pathogenesis, further distinguishing this viral virulence factor from other microbial enterotoxins."
17268555,Structural basis of T-cell specificity and activation by the bacterial superantigen TSST-1.,"Superantigens (SAGs) bind simultaneously to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules, resulting in the massive release of inflammatory cytokines that can lead to toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and death. A major causative agent of TSS is toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), which is unique relative to other bacterial SAGs owing to its structural divergence and its stringent TCR specificity. Here, we report the crystal structure of TSST-1 in complex with an affinity-matured variant of its wild-type TCR ligand, human T-cell receptor beta chain variable domain 2.1. From this structure and a model of the wild-type complex, we show that TSST-1 engages TCR ligands in a markedly different way than do other SAGs. We provide a structural basis for the high TCR specificity of TSST-1 and present a model of the TSST-1-dependent MHC-SAG-TCR T-cell signaling complex that is structurally and energetically unique relative to those formed by other SAGs. Our data also suggest that protein plasticity plays an exceptionally significant role in this affinity maturation process that results in more than a 3000-fold increase in affinity."
17612295,Yeast split-ubiquitin-based cytosolic screening system to detect interactions between transcriptionally active proteins.,"Interactions between proteins are central to most biological processes; consequently, understanding the latter requires identification of all possible protein interactions within a cell. To extend the range of existing assays for the detection of protein interactions, we present a novel genetic screening assay, the cytosolic yeast two-hybrid system (cytoY2H), which is based on the split-ubiquitin technique and detects protein-protein interactions in the cytoplasm. We show that the assay can be applied to a wide range of proteins that are difficult to study in the classical yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system, including transcription factors such as p53 and members of the NF-kappaB complex. Furthermore, we applied the cytoY2H system to cDNA library screening and identified several new interaction partners of Uri1p, an uncharacterized yeast protein. The cytoY2H system extends existing methods for the detection of protein interactions by providing a convenient solution for screening a wide range of transcriptionally active proteins."
12419245,Structural basis of chemokine sequestration by a herpesvirus decoy receptor.,"The M3 protein encoded by murine gamma herpesvirus68 (gamma HV68) functions as an immune system saboteur by the engagement of chemoattractant cytokines, thereby altering host antiviral inflammatory responses. Here we report the crystal structures of M3 both alone and in complex with the CC chemokine MCP-1. M3 is a two-domain beta sandwich protein with a unique sequence and topology, forming a tightly packed anti-parallel dimer. The stoichiometry of the MCP-1:M3 complex is 2:2, with two monomeric chemokines embedded at distal ends of the preassociated M3 dimer. Conformational flexibility and electrostatic complementation are both used by M3 to achieve high-affinity and broad-spectrum chemokine engagement. M3 also employs structural mimicry to promiscuously sequester chemokines, engaging conservative structural elements associated with both chemokine homodimerization and binding to G protein-coupled receptors."
15545266,Crystal structures of the FXIa catalytic domain in complex with ecotin mutants reveal substrate-like interactions.,"Thrombosis can lead to life-threatening conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Although commonly used anti-coagulant drugs, such as low molecular weight heparin and warfarin, are effective, they carry a significant risk of inducing severe bleeding complications, and there is a need for safer drugs. Activated Factor XI (FXIa) is a key enzyme in the amplification phase of the coagulation cascade. Anti-human FXI antibody significantly reduces thrombus growth in a baboon thrombosis model without bleeding problems (Gruber, A., and Hanson, S. R. (2003) Blood 102, 953-955). Therefore, FXIa is a potential target for anti-thrombosis therapy. To determine the structure of FXIa, we derived a recombinant catalytic domain of FXI, consisting of residues 370-607 (rhFXI370-607). Here we report the first crystal structure of rhFXI370-607 in complex with a substitution mutant of ecotin, a panserine protease protein inhibitor secreted by Escherichia coli, to 2.2 A resolution. The presence of ecotin not only assisted in the crystallization of the enzyme but also revealed unique structural features in the active site of FXIa. Subsequently, the sequence from P5 to P2' in ecotin was mutated to the FXIa substrate sequence, and the structures of the rhFXI370-607-ecotin mutant complexes were determined. These structures provide us with an understanding of substrate binding interactions of FXIa, the structural information essential for the structure-based design of FXIa-selective inhibitors."
15243628,Crystal structure of a complex between anthrax toxin and its host cell receptor.,"Anthrax toxin consists of the proteins protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF) and oedema factor (EF). The first step of toxin entry into host cells is the recognition by PA of a receptor on the surface of the target cell. Subsequent cleavage of receptor-bound PA enables EF and LF to bind and form a heptameric PA63 pre-pore, which triggers endocytosis. Upon acidification of the endosome, PA63 forms a pore that inserts into the membrane and translocates EF and LF into the cytosol. Two closely related host cell receptors, TEM8 and CMG2, have been identified. Both bind to PA with high affinity and are capable of mediating toxicity. Here, we report the crystal structure of the PA-CMG2 complex at 2.5 A resolution. The structure reveals an extensive receptor-pathogen interaction surface mimicking the non-pathogenic recognition of the extracellular matrix by integrins. The binding surface is closely conserved in the two receptors and across species, but is quite different in the integrin domains, explaining the specificity of the interaction. CMG2 engages two domains of PA, and modelling of the receptor-bound PA63 heptamer suggests that the receptor acts as a pH-sensitive brace to ensure accurate and timely membrane insertion. The structure provides new leads for the discovery of anthrax anti-toxins, and should aid the design of cancer therapeutics."
15326297,Structure of heptameric protective antigen bound to an anthrax toxin receptor: a role for receptor in pH-dependent pore formation.,"After binding to cellular receptors and proteolytic activation, the protective antigen component of anthrax toxin forms a heptameric prepore. The prepore later undergoes pH-dependent conversion to a pore, mediating translocation of the edema and lethal factors to the cytosol. We describe structures of the prepore (3.6 A) and a prepore:receptor complex (4.3 A) that reveal the location of pore-forming loops and an unexpected interaction of the receptor with the pore-forming domain. Lower pH is required for prepore-to-pore conversion in the presence of the receptor, indicating that this interaction regulates pH-dependent pore formation. We present an example of a receptor negatively regulating pH-dependent membrane insertion."
11251120,Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex.,"The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites."
11135665,How the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoS toxin downregulates Rac.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen. One of its major toxins, ExoS, is translocated into eukaryotic cells by a type III secretion pathway. ExoS is a dual function enzyme that affects two different Ras-related GTP binding proteins. The C-terminus inactivates Ras through ADP ribosylation, while the N-terminus inactivates Rho proteins through its GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity. Here we have determined the three-dimensional structure of a complex between Rac and the GAP domain of ExoS in the presence of GDP and AlF3. Composed of approximately 130 residues, this ExoS domain is the smallest GAP hitherto described. The GAP domain of ExoS is an all-helical protein with no obvious structural homology, and thus no recognizable evolutionary relationship, with the eukaryotic RhoGAP or RasGAP fold. Similar to other GAPs, ExoS downregulates Rac using an arginine finger to stabilize the transition state of the GTPase reaction, but the details of the ExoS-Rac interaction are unique. Considering the intrinsic resistance of P. aeruginosa to antibiotics, this might open up a new avenue towards blocking its pathogenicity."
14579355,The tissue factor/factor VIIa/factor Xa complex: a model built by docking and site-directed mutagenesis.,"Factor X is activated to factor Xa (fXa) in the extrinsic coagulation pathway by the tissue factor (TF)/factor VIIa (fVIIa) complex. Upon activation, the fXa molecule remains associated with the TF/fVIIa complex, and this ternary complex is known to activate protease-activated receptors (PARs) 1 and 2. Activation of fVII in the TF complex by fXa is also seen at physiologic concentrations. The ternary complexes TF/fVII/fXa, TF/fVIIa/fX, and TF/fVIIa/fXa are therefore all physiologically relevant and of interest as targets for inhibition of both coagulation and cell-signaling pathways that are important in cardiovascular disease and inflammation. We therefore present a model of the TF/fVIIa/fXa complex, built with the use of the available structures of the TF/fVIIa complex and fXa by protein-protein docking calculations with the program Surfdock. The fXa model has an extended conformation, similar to that of fVIIa in the TF/fVIIa complex, with extensive interactions with TF and the protease domain of fVIIa. All four domains of fXa are involved in the interaction. The gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) and epithelial growth factor (EGF1 and EGF2) domains of fVIIa are not significantly involved in the interaction. Docking of the Gla domain of fXa to TF/fVIIa has been reported previously. The docking results identify potential interface residues, allowing rational selection of target residues for site-directed mutagenesis. This combination of docking and mutagenesis confirms that residues Glu51 and Asn57 in the EGF1 domain, Asp92 and Asp95 in the EGF2 domain, and Asp 185a, Lys 186, and Lys134 in the protease domain of factor Xa are involved in the interaction with TF/fVIIa. Other fX protease domain residues predicted to be involved in the interaction come from the 160s loop and the N-terminus of the fX protease domain, which is oriented in such a way that activation of both fVII by fXa, and the reciprocal fX activation by fVIIa, is possible."
7236608,Crystallographic refinement and atomic models of a human Fc fragment and its complex with fragment B of protein A from Staphylococcus aureus at 2.9- and 2.8-A resolution.,"The model of human Fc fragment was refined at 2.9-A resolution. Two different automated procedures for crystallographic refinement were used [Deisenhofer, J., & Steigemann, W. (1975) Acta Crystallogr., Sec. B B31, 238; Jack, A., & Levitt, M. (1978) Acta Crystallogr., Sect. A A34, 931]. The final R value is 0.22. The dimer of CH3 domains closely resembles the CH1-CL aggregate in Fab fragments. There is no contact between CH2 domains. The contact between CH2 and CH3 domains has about one-third of the size of the CH3-CH3 contact. The carbohydrate, a branched chain of nine hexose units, covers parts of the C-contact face of the CH2 domain, shielding hydrophobic residues on this surface. Six atoms of the carbohydrate are within hydrogen-bonding distance of atoms in the CH2 domain. Crystallographic refinement of the complex between Fc fragment and fragment B of protein A from Staphylococcus aureus reduced the R value of the model is 0.24. A major part of the structure of fragment B consists of two alpha helics; the rest of the polypeptide chain is folded irregularly. In the crystal, fragment B forms two contacts with Fc fragment molecules. Contact 1 involves residues from both helices of fragment B, and residues from the CH2 and CH3 domains of FC, and is predominantly hydrophobic. Contact 2 is smaller than contact 1. Residues from the second helix and adjacent residues of fragment B and residues only from the CH3 domain of Fc contribute to contact 2. The nature of contact 2 is mainly polar and includes a sulfate ion. There are strong arguments that contact 1 is the fragment B-Fc contact formed in solution under physiological conditions, while contact 2 is a crystal contact."
17932491,Vinculin binding in its closed conformation by a helix addition mechanism.,"Vinculin links integrin receptors to the actin cytoskeleton by binding to talin. Vinculin is held in an inactive, closed-clamp conformation through hydrophobic interactions between its head and tail domains, and vinculin activation has long been thought to be dependent upon severing the head-tail interaction. Talin, alpha-actinin, and the invasin IpaA of Shigella flexneri sever vinculin's head-tail interaction by inserting an alpha-helix into vinculin's N-terminal four-helical bundle, provoking extensive conformational changes by a helical bundle conversion mechanism; these alterations in vinculin structure displace its tail domain, allowing vinculin to bind to its other partners. IpaA harbors two juxtaposed alpha-helical vinculin-binding sites (VBS) in its C-terminus. Here, we report that the lower affinity VBS of IpaA can also bind to the adjacent C-terminal four-helical bundle of vinculin's head domain through a helix addition mechanism. These hydrophobic interactions do not alter the conformation of this helical bundle, and the architecture of the complex suggests that IpaA can simultaneously interact with both of the four-helical bundle domains of vinculin's N-terminus to stabilize vinculin-IpaA interactions."
17235285,Phosphorylation-independent interaction between 14-3-3 and exoenzyme S: from structure to pathogenesis.,"14-3-3 proteins are phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-recognizing adapter proteins that regulate the activity of a vast array of targets. There are also examples of 14-3-3 proteins binding their targets via unphosphorylated motifs. Here we present a structural and biological investigation of the phosphorylation-independent interaction between 14-3-3 and exoenzyme S (ExoS), an ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ExoS binds to 14-3-3 in a novel binding mode mostly relying on hydrophobic contacts. The 1.5 A crystal structure is supported by cytotoxicity analysis, which reveals that substitution of the corresponding hydrophobic residues significantly weakens the ability of ExoS to modify the endogenous targets RAS/RAP1 and to induce cell death. Furthermore, mutation of key residues within the ExoS binding site for 14-3-3 impairs virulence in a mouse pneumonia model. In conclusion, we show that ExoS binds 14-3-3 in a novel reversed orientation that is primarily dependent on hydrophobic residues. This interaction is phosphorylation independent and is required for the function of ExoS."
9659904,Crystal structure of the complex of diphtheria toxin with an extracellular fragment of its receptor.,"We describe the crystal structure at 2.65 A resolution of diphtheria toxin (DT) complexed 1:1 with a fragment of its cell-surface receptor, the precursor of heparin-binding epidermal-growth-factor-like growth factor (HBEGF). HBEGF in the complex has the typical EGF-like fold and packs its principal beta hairpin against the face of a beta sheet in the receptor-binding domain of DT. The interface has a predominantly hydrophobic core, and polar interactions are formed at the periphery. The structure of the complex suggests that part of the membrane anchor of the receptor can interact with a hinge region of DT. The toxin molecule is thereby induced to form an open conformation conducive to membrane insertion. The structure provides a basis for altering the binding specificity of the toxin, and may also serve as a model for other EGF-receptor interactions."
11260720,Covalent inhibition revealed by the crystal structure of the caspase-8/p35 complex.,"Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that is crucial for normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. The p35 protein from baculoviruses effectively prevents apoptosis by its broad-spectrum caspase inhibition. Here we report the crystal structure of p35 in complex with human caspase-8 at 3.0 A resolution, and biochemical and mutagenesis studies based on the structural information. The structure reveals that the caspase is inhibited in the active site through a covalent thioester linkage to p35, which we confirmed by gel electrophoresis, hydroxylamine treatment and mass spectrometry experiments. The p35 protein undergoes dramatic conformational changes on cleavage by the caspase. The repositioning of the amino terminus of p35 into the active site of the caspase eliminates solvent accessibility of the catalytic dyad. This may be crucial for preventing hydrolysis of the thioester intermediate, which is supported by the abrogation of inhibitory activity through mutations at the N terminus of p35. The p35 protein also makes conserved contacts with the caspase outside the active-site region, providing the molecular basis for the broad-spectrum inhibitory activity of this protein. We demonstrate a new molecular mechanism of caspase inhibition, as well as protease inhibition in general."
7671300,Crystal structure of human uracil-DNA glycosylase in complex with a protein inhibitor: protein mimicry of DNA.,"Uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi) is a B. subtilis bacteriophage protein that protects the uracil-containing phage DNA by irreversibly inhibiting the key DNA repair enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG). The 1.9 A crystal structure of Ugi complexed to human UDG reveals that the Ugi structure, consisting of a twisted five-stranded antiparallel beta sheet and two alpha helices, binds by inserting a beta strand into the conserved DNA-binding groove of the enzyme without contacting the uracil specificity pocket. The resulting interface, which buries over 1200 A2 on Ugi and involves the entire beta sheet and an alpha helix, is polar and contains 22 water molecules. Ugi binds the sequence-conserved DNA-binding groove of UDG via shape and electrostatic complementarity, specific charged hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic packing enveloping Leu-272 from a protruding UDG loop. The apparent mimicry by Ugi of DNA interactions with UDG provides both a structural mechanism for UDG binding to DNA, including the enzyme-assisted expulsion of uracil from the DNA helix, and a crystallographic basis for the design of inhibitors with scientific and therapeutic applications."
11226179,Structural basis for the inactivation of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor by SV40 large T antigen.,"Inactivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor by Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen is one of the central features of tumorigenesis induced by SV40. Both the N-terminal J domain and the LxCxE motif of large T antigen are required for inactivation of Rb. The crystal structure of the N-terminal region (residues 7-117) of SV40 large T antigen bound to the pocket domain of Rb reveals that large T antigen contains a four-helix bundle, and residues from helices alpha2 and alpha4 and from a loop containing the LxCxE motif participate in the interactions with Rb. The two central helices and a connecting loop in large T antigen have structural similarities with the J domains of the molecular chaperones DnaJ and HDJ-1, suggesting that large T antigen may use a chaperone mechanism for its biological function. However, there are significant differences between large T antigen and the molecular chaperones in other regions and these differences are likely to provide the specificity needed for large T antigen to inactivate Rb."
8001121,Site-specific conformational alteration of the Oct-1 POU domain-DNA complex as the basis for differential recognition by Vmw65 (VP16).,"We show that the presence of a regulatory cis-acting element that flanks the core octamer site and dictates selectivity in the response to Vmw65 (VP16), while dispensable for POU binding per se, induces a conformational alteration in the nature of the POU domain in the DNA complex. A single substitution in the flanking signal distorts the POU complex and without affecting overall POU binding prevents Vmw65 interaction. Alternatively, substitution of a residue in the homeodomain predicted to contact the GARAT region prevents its recognition even on a wild-type motif, causing a reversion to the DNA binding pattern seen on a cellular motif and at the same time inefficient recognition by Vmw65. The results indicate that Vmw65 recognizes a particular POU domain conformation induced by the presence of the flanking GARAT region."
15784897,Further studies on hepatitis C virus NS5A-SH3 domain interactions: identification of residues critical for binding and implications for viral RNA replication and modulation of cell signalling.,"The NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus has been shown to interact with a subset of Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing proteins. The molecular mechanisms underlying these observations have not been fully characterized, therefore a previous analysis of NS5A-SH3 domain interactions was extended. By using a semi-quantitative ELISA assay, a hierarchy of binding between various SH3 domains for NS5A was demonstrated. Molecular modelling of a polyproline motif within NS5A (termed PP2.2) bound to the FynSH3 domain predicted that the specificity-determining RT-loop region within the SH3 domain did not interact directly with the PP2.2 motif. However, it was demonstrated that the RT loop did contribute to the specificity of binding, implicating the involvement of other intermolecular contacts between NS5A and SH3 domains. The modelling analysis also predicted a critical role for a conserved arginine located at the C terminus of the PP2.2 motif; this was confirmed experimentally. Finally, it was demonstrated that, in comparison with wild-type replicon cells, inhibition of the transcription factor AP-1, a function previously assigned to NS5A, was not observed in cells harbouring a subgenomic replicon containing a mutation within the PP2.2 motif. However, the ability of the mutated replicon to establish itself within Huh-7 cells was unaffected. The highly conserved nature of the PP2.2 motif within NS5A suggests that functions involving this motif are of importance, but are unlikely to play a role in replication of the viral RNA genome. It is more likely that they play a role in altering the cellular environment to favour viral persistence."
8806520,Simian virus 40 large T antigen binds to topoisomerase I.,"Binding of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen to human and calf thymus topoisomerase I (topo I) was readily detected by using modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblots. In addition to WT T antigen, binding could also be readily demonstrated with T antigen fragments from the amino-terminal region as well as with fragments missing this region, but much less so with small t antigen or with human p53. Antibody-blocking experiments showed that a monoclonal antibody that binds to the N-terminal region and several antibodies that recognize the central region of T antigen interfere with the binding to topo I. Our data are consistent with the existence of two separate topo I-binding regions in T antigen, one mapping within residues 82 to 246 and an apparently weaker one present after residue 246. By comparing the binding of T antigen to topo I with that of T antigen to DNA polymerase alpha or RPA, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, it was determined that the T antigen-topo I interaction is much stronger and that the binding sites for topo I and DNA polymerase overlap, whereas the one for RPA differs. Several unwinding-defective mutants of T antigen were partially defective in their binding to topo I, suggesting that the binding to topo I is required for unwinding circular DNA. Finally, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that T antigen can interact with DNA-bound topo I, indicating that such an interaction may take place during SV40 DNA replication."
8648648,Evidence that a kissing loop structure facilitates genomic RNA dimerisation in HIV-1.,"Genomic RNA isolated from retroviral particles is a dimer composed of two identical strands. A region called the dimer linkage signal close to the 5' end of the RNA may be involved in forming the dimer. Several models for the formation of the HIV-1 RNA dimer have been proposed. In the kissing loop model, dimerisation results from base-pairing between homologous sequences in an RNA stem-loop. In the guanine tetrad model interstrand guanine contacts from the dimer. We have made mutations preventing the dimerisation of subgenomic RNAs in vitro by these mechanisms. To prevent the kissing loop dimer forming we changed the complementary loop sequence from 711GCGCGC716 to 711AAACGC716. To prevent the guanine tetrad dimer forming we changed G819 to U. These mutations were introduced into a clone of HIV-1NL4-3 separately and collectively. All three clones produced infectious virions. Dimeric RNA with similar thermal stabilities was isolated from viruses containing either the single or the double mutations. The results suggest that sequences involved in forming a guanine tetrad are not important for HIV-1 RNA dimerisation. In contrast sequences involved in forming a kissing loop complex are not absolutely required, but are important in forming a stable HIV-1 RNA dimer."
16730714,Cellular stability of Rho-GTPases glucosylated by Clostridium difficile toxin B.,"Mono-glucosylation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 by Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) induces changes of actin dynamics and apoptosis. When fibroblasts were treated with TcdB, an apparent decrease of the cellular Rac1 level was observed when applying anti-Rac1(Mab 102). This decrease was not based on degradation as inhibition of the proteasome by lactacystin did not stabilise cellular Rac1 levels. The application of anti-Rac1 (Mab 23A8) showed that the cellular Rac1 level slightly increased in TcdB-treated fibroblasts; thus, the apparent loss of cellular Rac1 was not due to degradation but due to impaired recognition of glucosylated Rac1 by anti-Rac1 (Mab 102). In contrast, recognition of RhoA by anti-RhoA (Mab 26C4) and Cdc42 by anti-Cdc42 (Mab 44) was not altered by glucosylation; a transient decrease of cellular RhoA and Cdc42 in TcdB-treated fibroblasts was indeed due to proteasomal degradation, as inhibition of the proteasome by lactacystin stabilised both cellular RhoA and Cdc42 levels. The finding that the apparent decrease of Rac1 reflects Rac1 glucosylation offers a valuable tool to determine Rac1 glucosylation."
17064692,Pfnek3: an atypical activator of a MAP kinase in Plasmodium falciparum.,"The canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal cascade was previously suggested to be atypical in the malaria parasite. This raises queries on the existence of alternative mediators of plasmodial MAPK pathways. This study describes, Pfnek3, a malarial protein kinase belonging to the NIMA (Never in Mitosis, Aspergillus) family. Endogenous Pfnek3 is expressed during late asexual to gametocyte stages and lacks some classical protein kinase sequence motifs. Moreover, Pfnek3 is phylogenetically distant from mammalian NIMA-kinases. Recombinant Pfnek3 was able to phosphorylate and stimulate a malarial MAPK (Pfmap2). Contrastingly, this was not observed with two other kinases, Pfmap1 and human MAPK1, suggesting that the Pfnek3-Pfmap2 interaction may be specific for Pfmap2 regulation. In summary, our data reveal a malarial NIMA-kinase with the potential to regulate a MAPK. Possessing biochemical properties divergent from classical mammalian NIMA-kinases, Pfnek3 could potentially be an attractive target for parasite-selective anti-malarials."
16131227,Dynamics of SNARE assembly and disassembly during sperm acrosomal exocytosis.,"The dynamics of SNARE assembly and disassembly during membrane recognition and fusion is a central issue in intracellular trafficking and regulated secretion. Exocytosis of sperm's single vesicle--the acrosome--is a synchronized, all-or-nothing process that happens only once in the life of the cell and depends on activation of both the GTP-binding protein Rab3 and of neurotoxin-sensitive SNAREs. These characteristics make acrosomal exocytosis a unique mammalian model for the study of the different phases of the membrane fusion cascade. By using a functional assay and immunofluorescence techniques in combination with neurotoxins and a photosensitive Ca2+ chelator we show that, in unactivated sperm, SNAREs are locked in heterotrimeric cis complexes. Upon Ca2+ entry into the cytoplasm, Rab3 is activated and triggers NSF/alpha-SNAP-dependent disassembly of cis SNARE complexes. Monomeric SNAREs in the plasma membrane and the outer acrosomal membrane are then free to reassemble in loose trans complexes that are resistant to NSF/alpha-SNAP and differentially sensitive to cleavage by two vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-specific neurotoxins. Ca2+ must be released from inside the acrosome to trigger the final steps of membrane fusion that require fully assembled trans SNARE complexes and synaptotagmin. Our results indicate that the unidirectional and sequential disassembly and assembly of SNARE complexes drive acrosomal exocytosis."
16963744,"Human cellular protein VRK2 interacts specifically with Epstein-Barr virus BHRF1, a homologue of Bcl-2, and enhances cell survival.","BHRF1, an early gene product of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), is structurally and functionally homologous to Bcl-2, a cellular anti-apoptotic protein. BHRF1 has been shown to protect cells from apoptosis induced by numerous external stimuli. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is an epithelial cancer associated closely with EBV infection. Specific proteins that might interact with and modulate the BHRF1 anti-apoptotic activity in normal epithelial cells are of interest. Therefore, a cDNA library derived from normal human foreskin keratinocytes was screened by the yeast two-hybrid system and a cellular gene encoding human vaccinia virus B1R kinase-related kinase 2 (VRK2) was isolated. Interaction between the cellular VRK2 and viral BHRF1 proteins was further demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, confocal laser-scanning microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation. Analyses of VRK2-deletion mutants revealed that a 108 aa fragment at the C terminus was important for VRK2 to interact with BHRF1. For BHRF1, aa 1-18 and 89-142 were crucial in interacting with VRK2 and these two regions are counterparts of Bcl-2 homology domains 4 and 1. Overexpressed VRK2 alone showed a modest effect in anti-apoptosis and appeared to enhance cell survival in the presence of BHRF1. However, this enhancement was not observed when VRK2 was co-expressed with Bcl-2. The results indicate that human VRK2 interacts specifically with EBV BHRF1 and that the interaction is involved in protecting cells from apoptosis."
16257957,Regulation of transactivation function of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded EBNA-3 protein.,"EBNA-3 is one of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear antigens that is indispensable for immunoblastic transformation and sustained proliferation of B-lymphocytes. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the function of EBNA-3 are poorly understood. We previously found that EBNA-3 interacts with an immunophilin-like protein XAP2/ARA9/AIP, which in mammalian cells is known to interact with the latent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that mediates cellular responses to environmental pollutants, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). In this study, we show that EBNA-3 interacts specifically with AhR. The stability of this interaction is determined by the activation state of AhR and its association with XAP2. We and others have demonstrated that XAP2 retains the nonactivated AhR in the cell cytoplasm. However, in the presence of TCDD, the effect of XAP2 on the intracellular localization of AhR was counter-acted by EBNA-3, resulting in nuclear translocation of the AhR. In addition, EBNA-3 enhanced transactivation function by the ligand-activated AhR in cells, as assessed by reporter gene assays. Our data suggested that EBNA-3 plays a role in facilitating the ligand-dependent AhR activation process. Following activation of the AhR, we also observed that EBNA-3 counteracted the inhibitory effect of TCDD on the growth of EBV-carrying lymphoblasts. Taken together, our studies revealed a novel interaction between EBV- and AhR-dependent cellular pathways that control cell proliferation and survival."
15604276,Adenoviral E1A targets Mdm4 to stabilize tumor suppressor p53.,"The adenoviral protein E1A associates with multiple anticancer activities, including stabilization of p53 tumor suppressor, and has been tested through gene therapy approaches in clinical trials. To identify potential E1A-binding proteins involved in E1A's anticancer activities, we screened a yeast two-hybrid library and identified Mdm4, an Mdm2-related p53-binding protein, as a novel E1A-binding protein. The NH(2)-terminal region of Mdm4 and the CR1 domain of E1A were required for the interaction between E1A and Mdm4. E1A preferentially bound to Mdm4 rather than Mdm2 and formed a complex with p53 in the presence of Mdm4, resulting in the stabilization of p53 in a p14(ARF)-independent manner. E1A failed to stabilize p53 in the absence of Mdm4, showing that Mdm4 was required for p53 stabilization by E1A. Moreover, E1A-mediated stabilization of p53 occurred in nucleus. Although it had no effect on the p53-Mdm2 interaction, E1A facilitated Mdm4 binding to p53 and inhibited Mdm2 binding to Mdm4, resulting in decreased nuclear exportation of p53. Thus, our findings highlighted a novel mechanism, whereby E1A stabilized the p53 tumor suppressor through Mdm4."
9299613,"P32/TAP, a cellular protein that interacts with EBNA-1 of Epstein-Barr virus.","The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA-1 protein has a central role in the maintenance of a latent EBV infection and is the only virus-encoded protein expressed in all EBV-associated tumors. EBNA-1 is required for replication of the episomal form of the latent viral genome and transactivates the latency C and LMP-1 promoters. The mechanisms by which EBNA-1 performs these functions are not known. Here we describe the cloning, expression, and characterization of a cellular protein, P32/TAP, which strongly interacts with EBNA-1. We show that P32/TAP is expressed at high levels in Raji cells and is synthesized as a proprotein of 282 amino acids (aa) that is posttranslationally processed by a two-step cleavage process to yield a mature protein of 209 aa. It has been previously reported that P32/TAP is expressed on the cell surface. Our transient expression assays detected full-length P32/TAP (1-282 aa) in the cytoplasm while mature P32/TAP protein localized to the nucleus. Three lines of evidence support P32/TAP interaction with EBNA-1. First, in the yeast two-hybrid system we mapped two interactive N-terminal regions of EBNA-1, aa 40-60 and aa 325-376, each of which contains arginine-glycine repeats. These regions interact with the C-terminal half of P32/TAP. Second, the full-length cytoplasmic P32/TAP protein can translocate nuclear EBNA-1 into the cytoplasm. Third, P32/TAP co-immunoprecipitated with EBNA-1. We have confirmed that a Gal4 fusion protein containing the C-terminal region of P32/TAP (aa 244-282) transactivates expression from a reporter containing upstream Gal4-binding sites. Deletion of the P32/TAP interactive regions of EBNA-1 severely diminished EBNA-1 transactivation of FRTKCAT in transient expression assays. Our data suggest that interaction with P32/TAP may contribute to EBNA-1-mediated transactivation."
12620797,Modulation of interferon expression by hepatitis C virus NS5A protein and human homeodomain protein PTX1.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein transcriptionally modulates a number of cellular genes. Since there is no evidence of binding of NS5A protein to DNA, it is likely to exert its activity in concert with cellular factor(s). In this study, we have identified a specific interaction of HCV NS5A with homeodomain protein PTX1 of human origin by a yeast two-hybrid interacting cloning system. The authenticity of this interaction was verified by mammalian two-hybrid assay, in vivo co-immunoprecipitation analysis, and from a colocalization study. Recently, murine PTX1 (mPTX1) has been shown to repress virus-induced murine interferonA4 promoter activity. Interferon-à alone or together with ribavirin is the only available therapy for HCV-infected patients. Therefore, we examined whether coexpression of NS5A and human PTX1 (hPTX1) proteins modulate human IFN-à promoter activity. An in vitro reporter assay by transfection of HepG2 cells with NS5A suggested an activation of IFN-à promoter to approximately 20-fold upon Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection. Under similar experimental conditions, hPTX1-activated IFN-à prompter to approximately sevenfold, unlike mPTX1. However, cotransfection of NS5A and hPTX1 displayed a lower interferon promoter activity, probably for physical association between these two proteins. Subsequent study demonstrated that activation of IFN promoter by NS5A is associated with an increased expression of IRF-3. Further analysis revealed that ectopic expression of NS5A in HepG2 cells enhances endogenous IFN-à secretion and MxA expression upon induction with NDV. However, exogenous expression of hPTX1 did not significantly alter NS5A-mediated function in the stable transfectants. Taken together, these results suggested that the level of endogenous hPTX1 is not sufficient to block the function of NS5A for augmentation of virus-mediated IFN activity in HepG2 cells."
14623081,Direct interaction between alpha-actinin and hepatitis C virus NS5B.,"It has been suggested that cellular proteins are involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated seven cDNA clones encoding proteins interacting with HCV RNA polymerase (NS5B) from a human liver cDNA library. For one of these, alpha-actinin, we confirmed the interaction by coimmunoprecipitation, immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopic analysis. Experiments with deletion mutants showed that domains NS5B(84-95), NS5B(466-478), and alpha-actinin(621-733) are responsible for the interaction. Studies of the HCV subgenomic replicon system with small interference RNA indicate that alpha-actinin is essential for HCV RNA replication. Our results suggest alpha-actinin may be a component of the HCV replication complex."
12634373,Interaction with a ubiquitin-like protein enhances the ubiquitination and degradation of hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.,"To identify potential cellular regulators of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B), we searched for cellular proteins interacting with NS5B protein by yeast two-hybrid screening of a human hepatocyte cDNA library. We identified a ubiquitin-like protein, hPLIC1 (for human homolog 1 of protein linking intergrin-associated protein and cytoskeleton), which is expressed in the liver (M. F. Kleijnen, A. H. Shih, P. Zhou, S. Kumar, R. E. Soccio, N. L. Kedersha, G. Gill, and P. M. Howley, Mol. Cell 6: 409-419, 2000). In vitro binding assays and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed the interaction between hPLIC1 and NS5B, which occurred through the ubiquitin-associated domain at the C terminus of the hPLIC1 protein. As hPLICs have been shown to physically associate with two E3 ubiquitin protein ligases as well as proteasomes (Kleijnen et al., Mol. Cell 6: 409-419, 2000), we investigated whether the stability and posttranslational modification of NS5B were affected by hPLIC1. A pulse-chase labeling experiment revealed that overexpression of hPLIC1, but not the mutant lacking the NS5B-binding domain, significantly shortened the half-life of NS5B and enhanced the polyubiquitination of NS5B. Furthermore, in Huh7 cells that express an HCV subgenomic replicon, the amounts of both NS5B and the replicon RNA were reduced by overexpression of hPLIC1. Thus, hPLIC1 may be a regulator of HCV RNA replication through interaction with NS5B."
17006541,Regulation of TopBP1 oligomerization by Akt/PKB for cell survival.,"Regulation of E2F1-mediated apoptosis is essential for proper cellular growth. This control requires TopBP1, a BRCT (BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal) domain-containing protein, which interacts with E2F1 but not other E2Fs and represses its proapoptotic activity. We now show that the regulation of E2F1 by TopBP1 involves the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, and is independent of pocket proteins. Akt phosphorylates TopBP1 in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation by Akt induces oligomerization of TopBP1 through its seventh and eighth BRCT domains. The Akt-dependent oligomerization is crucial for TopBP1 to interact with and repress E2F1. Akt phosphorylation is also required for interaction between TopBP1 and Miz1 or HPV16 E2, and repression of Miz1 transcriptional activity, suggesting a general role for TopBP1 oligomerization in the control of transcription factors. Together, this study defines a novel pathway involving PI3K-Akt-TopBP1 for specific control of E2F1 apoptosis, in parallel with cyclin-Cdk-Rb for general control of E2F activities."
11689660,"Interaction of zyxin, a focal adhesion protein, with the e6 protein from human papillomavirus type 6 results in its nuclear translocation.","Zyxin, a focal adhesion molecule, interacts specifically with the E6 protein from human papillomavirus (HPV) type 6 in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library prepared from human keratinocytes. Zyxin does not interact significantly with E6 proteins from HPV types 11, 16, or 18. The interaction was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo analyses and it requires the LIM domains (Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3 [G. Freyd, S. K. Kim, and H. R. Horvitz, Nature 344:876-879, 1990]) found at the carboxyl terminus of zyxin. Cotransfection of E6 from HPV ((6)E6) and zyxin results in the accumulation of zyxin in the nucleus where it can function as a transcriptional activator. (6)E6 can also mobilize endogenous zyxin to the nucleus."
11119584,"Gps2, a protein partner for human papillomavirus E6 proteins.","We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a cDNA library prepared from normal human epidermal keratinocytes and identified protein partners for human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 proteins. A clone that encoded Gps2 interacted with E6 proteins from HPVs of high and low oncogenic risk. The specificity of these reactions was verified and the regions of E6 that were required for interaction were mapped. Steady-state and pulse-chase analyses of cells cotransfected with DNAs expressing E6 from either HPV6 or HPV18 and Gps2 demonstrated that the E6 proteins induced the degradation of Gps2 in vivo but not in vitro. Gps2 exhibited transcriptional activation activity, and high-risk E6 suppressed this activity."
11713253,Human papillomavirus type 16 E7 binds to E2F1 and activates E2F1-driven transcription in a retinoblastoma protein-independent manner.,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 oncoprotein can immortalize primary human cells and induce tumor formation. These properties of E7 depend on its ability to inhibit the activity of retinoblastoma protein (pRB), which in turn affects E2F function. E2F proteins control the expression of genes involved in differentiation, development, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. By using genetic and biochemical approaches, the present study shows that E7 binds to E2F1 in vivo and in vitro and that both proteins co-localize in the nucleus. Importantly, the binding of the high risk group HPV E7 to E2F1 is tighter than the binding of the low risk group HPV E7 to E2F1. Although E7 of the high risk group HPVs activates E2F1-dependent transcription strongly in C33A or 293T cells, E7 of the low risk group HPVs activates transcription only weakly. By using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we also showed that E7 binds to E2F1-DNA complexes. Furthermore, we show that these activities of E7 are independent of pRB by using E7 and E2F1 mutants that cannot bind to pRB. Taken together, these data suggest that E7 contributes to the deregulation of pRB-dependent E2F1 repression and to the further activation of E2F1 independently of pRB."
9326658,Binding of high-risk human papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins to the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein.,"In the majority of cervical cancers, DNAs of high-risk mucosotpropic human papillomaviruses (HPVs), such as type 16, are maintained so as to express two viral proteins, E6 and E7, suggesting an essential importance to carcinogenesis. The high-risk HPV E6 proteins are known to inactivate p53 tumor suppressor protein but appear to have an additional, molecularly unknown function(s). In this study, we demonstrate that these E6 proteins can bind to the second PDZ domain of the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein (hDLG) through their C-terminal XS/TXV/L (where X represents any amino acid, S/T serine or threonine, and V/L valine or leucine) motif. This finding is similar to the interaction between the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product and hDLG. E6 mutants losing the ability to bind to hDLG are no longer able to induce E6-dependent transformation of rodent cells. These results suggest an intriguing possibility that interaction between the E6 protein and hDLG or other PDZ domain-containing proteins could be an underlying mechanism in the development of HPV-associated cancers."
10487758,The E6 protein of human papillomavirus type 16 binds to and inhibits co-activation by CBP and p300.,"The co-activators CBP and p300 are important for normal cell differentiation and cell cycle progression and are the targets for viral proteins that dysregulate these cellular processes. We show here that the E6 protein from the oncogenic human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) binds to three regions (C/H1, C/H3 and the C-terminus) of both CBP and p300. The interaction of E6 with CBP/p300 was direct and independent of proteins known to bind the co-activators, such as p53. The E6 protein from low-risk HPV type 6 did not interact with C/H3 or the C-terminus but associated with the C/H1 domain at 50% of the level of HPV-16. HPV-16 E6 inhibited the intrinsic transcriptional activity of CBP/p300 and decreased the ability of p300 to activate p53- and NF-kappaB-responsive promoter elements. Interestingly, some mutations in HPV-16 E6 abrogated C/H3-E6 interactions, but did not alter the ability of E6 to associate with the C/H1 domain, suggesting that these modified proteins could be used to delineate the functional significance of the C/H1 and C/H3 domains of CBP/p300."
15044019,HBZ interacts with JunD and stimulates its transcriptional activity.,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) bZIP factor (HBZ) is a viral basic leucine zipper protein that was originally described as a partner of cAMP response element binding protein-2 and as a repressor of HTLV-I viral transcription. In addition, HBZ is able to interact with the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors c-Jun and JunB, the interaction with c-Jun leading to a transcriptional repression of AP-1-regulated genes. Here we show that HBZ also interacts with JunD in vitro and in vivo, and that this association occurs via the bZIP domain of the two proteins. Moreover, we show that HBZ can activate JunD-dependent transcription and that its amino-terminus is required."
16917502,PRA1 promotes the intracellular trafficking and NF-kappaB signaling of EBV latent membrane protein 1.,"Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), which is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded oncoprotein, induces nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling by mimicking the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR). LMP1 signals primarily from intracellular compartments in a ligand-independent manner. Here, we identify a new LMP1-interacting molecule, prenylated Rab acceptor 1 (PRA1), which interacts with LMP1 for the first time through LMP1's transmembrane domain, and show that PRA1 is involved in intracellular LMP1 trafficking and LMP1-induced NF-kappaB activity. Immunofluorescence and biochemical analyses revealed that LMP1 physically interacted with PRA1 at the Golgi apparatus, and the colocalization of LMP1 and PRA1 to the Golgi was sensitive to nocodazole and brefeldin A. Coexpression of a PRA1 export mutant or knockdown of PRA1 led to redistribution of LMP1 and its associated signaling molecules to the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent impairment of LMP1-induced NF-kappaB activation, but had no effect on CD40- and TNFR1-mediated signaling or the functional integrity of the Golgi apparatus. These novel findings provide important new insights into LMP1, and identify an unexpected new role for PRA1 in cellular signaling."
17024179,Hepatitis C virus RNA replication is regulated by FKBP8 and Hsp90.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a component of viral replicase and is well known to modulate the functions of several host proteins. Here, we show that NS5A specifically interacts with FKBP8, a member of the FK506-binding protein family, but not with other homologous immunophilins. Three sets of tetratricopeptide repeats in FKBP8 are responsible for interactions with NS5A. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of FKBP8 in a human hepatoma cell line harboring an HCV RNA replicon suppressed HCV RNA replication, and this reduction was reversed by the expression of an siRNA-resistant FKBP8 mutant. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that FKBP8 forms a complex with Hsp90 and NS5A. Treatment of HCV replicon cells with geldanamycin, an inhibitor of Hsp90, suppressed RNA replication in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the complex consisting of NS5A, FKBP8, and Hsp90 plays an important role in HCV RNA replication."
16963558,Influenza A virus NS1 protein binds p85beta and activates phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling.,"Influenza A virus NS1 is a multifunctional protein, and in virus-infected cells NS1 modulates a number of host-cell processes by interacting with cellular factors. Here, we report that NS1 binds directly to p85beta, a regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), but not to the related p85alpha subunit. Activation of PI3K in influenza virus-infected cells depended on genome replication, and showed kinetics that correlated with NS1 expression. Additionally, it was found that expression of NS1 alone was sufficient to constitutively activate PI3K, causing the phosphorylation of a downstream mediator of PI3K signal transduction, Akt. Mutational analysis of a potential SH2-binding motif within NS1 indicated that the highly conserved tyrosine at residue 89 is important for both the interaction with p85beta, and the activation of PI3K. A mutant influenza virus (A/Udorn/72) expressing NS1 with the Y89F amino acid substitution exhibited a small-plaque phenotype, and grew more slowly in tissue culture than WT virus. These data suggest that activation of PI3K signaling in influenza A virus-infected cells is important for efficient virus replication."
16501113,Interaction of the adenovirus type 5 E4 Orf3 protein with promyelocytic leukemia protein isoform II is required for ND10 disruption.,"Nuclear domain 10 (ND10s), or promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies, are spherical nuclear structures that require PML proteins for their formation. Many viruses target these structures during infection. The E4 Orf3 protein of adenovirus 5 (Ad5) rearranges ND10s, causing PML to colocalize with Orf3 in nuclear tracks or fibers. There are six different PML isoforms (I to VI) present at ND10s, all sharing a common N terminus but with structural differences at their C termini. In this study, PML II was the only one of these six isoforms that was found to interact directly and specifically with Ad5 E4 Orf3 in vitro and in vivo; these results define a new Orf3 activity. Three of a series of 18 mutant Orf3 proteins were unable to interact with PML II; these were also unable to cause ND10 rearrangement. Moreover, in PML-null cells that contained neoformed ND10s comprising a single PML isoform, only ND10s formed of PML II were rearranged by Orf3. These data show that the interaction between Orf3 and PML II is necessary for ND10 rearrangement to occur. Finally, Orf3 was shown to self-associate in vitro. This activity was absent in mutant Orf3 proteins that were unable to form tracks and to bind PML II. Thus, Orf3 oligomerization may mediate the formation of nuclear tracks in vivo and may also be important for PML II binding."
15492812,The PDZ protein Tip-1 is a gain of function target of the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein.,"Previous work has indicated that the PDZ domain Tax interacting protein 1 (Tip-1) is a target of the HTLV1 Tax protein and is a potential RhoA effector. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to show that Tip-1 also interacts with the HPV16 E6 protein. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from E6 expressing C33A cervical carcinoma cells (C33A-E6) which showed that Tip-1 was not degraded by interaction with the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein. During routine passage we observed that C33A-E6 had a less compact morphology and were less adherent than control vector transfected cells C33A-V cells - a known effect of GTP-RhoA. Comparison of C33A-E6 to C33A-V demonstrated that E6 expressing cells had higher levels of phosphorylated myosin light chains (MLC) and increased cell motility, which was inhibited by antisense silencing of Tip-1 expression and by the RhoA kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632. Both C33A-E6 and C33A-V cells were shown to express GTP activated RhoA. Since ROCKs can be activated by GTP RhoA these data indicate that E6 may increase cell motility by augmenting GTP RhoA mediated activation of ROCKs and that this is dependent on the expression of the Tip-1 protein."
18172216,SOCS1 is an inducible host factor during HIV-1 infection and regulates the intracellular trafficking and stability of HIV-1 Gag.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) utilizes the macromolecular machinery of the infected host cell to produce progeny virus. The discovery of cellular factors that participate in HIV-1 replication pathways has provided further insight into the molecular basis of virus-host cell interactions. Here, we report that the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is an inducible host factor during HIV-1 infection and regulates the late stages of the HIV-1 replication pathway. SOCS1 can directly bind to the matrix and nucleocapsid regions of the HIV-1 p55 Gag polyprotein and enhance its stability and trafficking, resulting in the efficient production of HIV-1 particles via an IFN signaling-independent mechanism. The depletion of SOCS1 by siRNA reduces both the targeted trafficking and assembly of HIV-1 Gag, resulting in its accumulation as perinuclear solid aggregates that are eventually subjected to lysosomal degradation. These results together indicate that SOCS1 is a crucial host factor that regulates the intracellular dynamism of HIV-1 Gag and could therefore be a potential new therapeutic target for AIDS and its related disorders."
17991777,An influenza virus replicon system in yeast identified Tat-SF1 as a stimulatory host factor for viral RNA synthesis.,"Influenza viruses infect vertebrates, including mammals and birds. Influenza virus reverse-genetics systems facilitate the study of the structure and function of viral factors. In contrast, less is known about host factors involved in the replication process. Here, we developed a replication and transcription system of the negative-strand RNA genome of the influenza virus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which depends on viral RNAs, viral RNA polymerases, and nucleoprotein (NP). Disruption of SUB2 encoding an orthologue of human RAF-2p48/UAP56, a previously identified viral RNA synthesis stimulatory host factor, resulted in reduction of the viral RNA synthesis rate. Using a genome-wide set of yeast single-gene deletion strains, we found several host factor candidates affecting viral RNA synthesis. We found that among them, Tat-SF1, a mammalian homologue of yeast CUS2, was a stimulatory host factor in influenza virus RNA synthesis. Tat-SF1 interacted with free NP, but not with NP associated with RNA, and facilitated formation of RNA-NP complexes. These results suggest that Tat-SF1 may function as a molecular chaperone for NP, as does RAF-2p48/UAP56. This system has proven useful for further studies on the mechanism of influenza virus genome replication and transcription."
18836454,Phosphorylation of APOBEC3G by protein kinase A regulates its interaction with HIV-1 Vif.,"Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G, referred to here as A3G) is a potent antiretroviral host factor against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) counteracts A3G by promoting its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Recent studies demonstrated that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates activation-induced deaminase (AID), another member of the APOBEC3 family. A3G has two putative PKA phosphorylation residues. Here we show that PKA binds and specifically phosphorylates A3G at Thr32 in vitro and in vivo. This phosphorylation event reduces the binding of A3G to Vif and its subsequent ubiquitination and degradation, and thus promotes A3G antiviral activity. Computer-assisted structural modeling and mutagenesis studies suggest that the interaction between A3G Thr32 and Arg24 is crucial for interaction with Vif. These data imply that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of A3G can regulate the interaction between A3G and Vif."
17698809,von Hippel Lindau binding protein 1-mediated degradation of integrase affects HIV-1 gene expression at a postintegration step.,"HIV-1 integrase, the viral enzyme responsible for provirus integration into the host genome, can be actively degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here, we identify von Hippel-Lindau binding protein 1(VBP1), a subunit of the prefoldin chaperone, as an integrase cellular binding protein that bridges interaction between integrase and the cullin2 (Cul2)-based von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that VBP1 and Cul2/VHL are required for proper HIV-1 expression at a step between integrase-dependent proviral integration into the host genome and transcription of viral genes. Using both an siRNA approach and Cul2/VHL mutant cells, we show that VBP1 and the Cul2/VHL ligase cooperate in the efficient polyubiquitylation of integrase and its subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Results presented here support a role for integrase degradation by the prefoldin-VHL-proteasome pathway in the integration-transcription transition of the viral replication cycle."
10381623,A novel adenovirus E1B19K-binding protein B5 inhibits apoptosis induced by Nip3 by forming a heterodimer through the C-terminal hydrophobic region.,"The adenovirus E1B19K protein inhibits apoptosis induced by E1A and other divergent signals. The cellular proteins that interact with E1B19K have been analyzed by isolating cDNA clones by the yeast two hybrid system. One of these clones encodes B5 which consists of 219 amino acid residues and contains the putative BH3 and transmembrane regions. B5 binds strongly to Nip3 and itself, weakly to E1B19K, but not to Bcl-2 and localizes in nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. B5 has sequence homology with Nip3 in the middle and C-terminal regions, but not in the N-terminal region. Unlike other E1B19K binding BH3 proteins so far characterized, B5 does not induce apoptosis, but inhibits apoptosis induced by Nip3. However the deletion mutant B5Delta1-31 lacking the N-terminus does induce apoptosis, although weaker than does Nip3, suggesting that the N-terminal region is masking the apoptosis-inducing capacity of B5."
7479821,Molecular cloning and characterization of a cellular phosphoprotein that interacts with a conserved C-terminal domain of adenovirus E1A involved in negative modulation of oncogenic transformation.,"The adenovirus type 2/5 E1A proteins transform primary baby rat kidney (BRK) cells in cooperation with the activated Ras (T24 ras) oncoprotein. The N-terminal half of E1A (exon 1) is essential for this transformation activity. While the C-terminal half of E1A (exon 2) is dispensable, a region located between residues 225 and 238 of the 243R E1A protein negatively modulates in vitro T24 ras cooperative transformation as well as the tumorigenic potential of E1A/T24 ras-transformed cells. The same C-terminal domain is also required for binding of a cellular 48-kDa phosphoprotein, C-terminal binding protein (CtBP). We have cloned the cDNA for CtBP via yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning. The cDNA encodes a 439-amino acid (48 kDa) protein that specifically interacts with exon 2 in yeast two-hybrid, in vitro protein binding, and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation analyses. This protein requires residues 225-238 of the 243R E1A protein for interaction. The predicted protein sequence of the isolated cDNA is identical to amino acid sequences obtained from peptides prepared from biochemically purified CtBP. Fine mapping of the CtBP-binding domain revealed that a 6-amino acid motif highly conserved among the E1A proteins of various human and animal adenoviruses is required for this interaction. These results suggest that interaction of CtBP with the E1A proteins may play a critical role in adenovirus replication and oncogenic transformation."
14517264,Transglutaminase 2 inhibits Rb binding of human papillomavirus E7 by incorporating polyamine.,"Transglutaminase 2 (TGase 2) is one of a family of enzymes that catalyze protein modification through the incorporation of polyamines into substrates or the formation of protein crosslinks. However, the physiological roles of TGase 2 are largely unknown. To elucidate the functions of TGase 2, we have searched for its interacting proteins. Here we show that TGase 2 interacts with E7 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV18) in vitro and in vivo. TGase 2 incorporates polyamines into a conserved glutamine residue in the zinc-binding domain of HPV18 E7 protein. This modification mediates the inhibition of E7's Rb binding ability. In contrast, TGase 2 does not affect HPV16 E7, due to absence of a glutamine residue at this polyamination site. Using E7 mutants, we demonstrate that TGase 2-dependent inhibition of HPV E7 function correlates with the presence of the polyamination site. Our results indicate that TGase 2 is an important cellular interfering factor and define a novel host-virus interaction, suggesting that the inability of TGase 2 to inactivate HPV16 E7 could explain the high prevalence of HPV16 in cervical cancer."
11934887,The human papillomavirus 16 E6 protein binds to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) R1 and protects cells from TNF-induced apoptosis.,"High risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), such as HPV 16, cause human cervical carcinoma. The E6 protein of HPV 16 mediates the rapid degradation of p53, although this is not the only function of E6 and cannot completely explain its transforming potential. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that transfection of HPV 16 E6 into the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-sensitive LM cell line protects expressing cells from TNF-induced apoptosis in a p53-independent manner, and the purpose of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism underlying this protection. Caspase 3 and caspase 8 activation were significantly reduced in E6-expressing cells, indicating that E6 acts early in the TNF apoptotic pathway. In fact, E6 binds directly to TNF R1, as shown both by co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid approaches. E6 requires the same C-terminal portion of TNF R1 for binding as does TNF R1-associated death domain, and TNF R1/TNF R1-associated death domain interactions are decreased in the presence of E6. HA-E6 also blocked cell death triggered by transfection of the death domain of TNF R1. Together, these results provide strong support for a model in which HPV E6 binding to TNF R1 interferes with formation of the death-inducing signaling complex and thus with transduction of proapoptotic signals. They also demonstrate that HPV, like several other viruses, has developed a method for evading the TNF-mediated host immune response."
15215856,A membrane protein complex mediates retro-translocation from the ER lumen into the cytosol.,"Elimination of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by retro-translocation is an important physiological adaptation to ER stress. This process requires recognition of a substrate in the ER lumen and its subsequent movement through the membrane by the cytosolic p97 ATPase. Here we identify a p97-interacting membrane protein complex in the mammalian ER that links these two events. The central component of the complex, Derlin-1, is a homologue of Der1, a yeast protein whose inactivation prevents the elimination of misfolded luminal ER proteins. Derlin-1 associates with different substrates as they move through the membrane, and inactivation of Derlin-1 in C. elegans causes ER stress. Derlin-1 interacts with US11, a virally encoded ER protein that specifically targets MHC class I heavy chains for export from the ER, as well as with VIMP, a novel membrane protein that recruits the p97 ATPase and its cofactor."
17382937,A proline to glycine mutation in the Lck SH3-domain affects conformational sampling and increases ligand binding affinity.,"Loop flexibility is discussed as a factor that affects ligand binding affinity of SH3 domains. To test this hypothesis, we designed a mutant in which a proline in the RT-loop of the human Lck SH3-domain is replaced by glycine. The dynamics and ligand binding properties of wild-type and mutant LckSH3 were studied by fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy as well as molecular dynamics simulations. Although the mutated residue does not form direct contacts with the ligand, the mutation increases ligand affinity by a factor of eight. The mutant exhibits increased loop flexibility and enhanced sampling of binding-competent conformations. This effect is expected to facilitate ligand binding itself and might also allow formation of tighter contacts in the complex thus resulting in an increased binding affinity."
16474402,Molecular recognition of p53 and MDM2 by USP7/HAUSP.,"The ubiquitin-specific protease, USP7, has key roles in the p53 pathway whereby it stabilizes both p53 and MDM2. We show that the N-terminal domain of USP7 binds two closely spaced 4-residue sites in both p53 and MDM2, falling between p53 residues 359-367 and MDM2 residues 147-159. Cocrystal structures with USP7 were determined for both p53 peptides and for one MDM2 peptide. These peptides bind the same surface of USP7 as Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1, explaining the competitive nature of the interactions. The structures and mutagenesis data indicate a preference for a P/AXXS motif in peptides that bind USP7. Contacts made by serine are identical and crucial for all peptides, and Trp165 in the peptide-binding pocket of USP7 is also crucial. These results help to elucidate the mechanism of substrate recognition by USP7 and the regulation of the p53 pathway."
10675342,Hepatitis C virus core protein-induced loss of LZIP function correlates with cellular transformation.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major etiological agent of blood-borne non-A non-B hepatitis and a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. HCV core protein is a multifunctional protein with regulatory functions in cellular transcription and virus-induced transformation and pathogenesis. Here we report on the identification of a bZIP nuclear transcription protein as an HCV core cofactor for transformation. This bZIP factor, designated LZIP, activates CRE-dependent transcription and regulates cell proliferation. Loss of LZIP function in NIH 3T3 cells triggers morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth. We show that HCV core protein aberrantly sequesters LZIP in the cytoplasm, inactivates LZIP function and potentiates cellular transformation. Our findings suggest that LZIP might serve a novel cellular tumor suppressor function that is targeted by the HCV core."
18474220,Interaction with Ppil3 leads to the cytoplasmic localization of Apoptin in tumor cells.,"Apoptin, a small protein encoded by chicken anemia virus (CAV), induces cell death specifically in cancer cells. In normal cells, Apoptin remains in the cytoplasm; whereas in cancerous cells, it migrates into the nucleus and kills the cell. Cellular localization appears to be crucial. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified human Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase-like 3 (Ppil3) as one of the Apoptin-associated proteins. Ppil3 could bind Apoptin directly, and held Apoptin in cytoplasm even in tumor cells. We then demonstrated that the nuclearcytoplasmic distribution of Apoptin is related to the expression level of intrinsic Ppil3. Moreover, extrinsic modifying of Ppil3 levels also resulted in nuclearcytoplasmic shuffling of Apoptin. The Apoptin P109A mutant, located between the putative nuclear localization and export signals, could significantly impair the function of Ppil3. Our results suggest a new direction for the localization mechanism study of Apoptin in cells."
9874765,"CIR, a corepressor linking the DNA binding factor CBF1 to the histone deacetylase complex.","CBF1 is a member of the CSL family of DNA binding factors, which mediate either transcriptional repression or transcriptional activation. CSL proteins play a central role in Notch signaling and in Epstein-Barr virus-induced immortalization. Notch is a transmembrane protein involved in cell-fate decisions, and the cytoplasmic domain of Notch (NotchIC) targets CBF1. The Epstein-Barr virus-immortalizing protein EBNA2 activates both cellular and viral gene expression by targeting CBF1 and mimicking NotchIC. We have examined the mechanism of CBF1-mediated repression and show that CBF1 binds to a unique corepressor, CBF1 interacting corepressor (CIR). A CIR homolog is encoded by Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that CIR is evolutionarily conserved. Two CBF1 mutants that were unable to bind CIR did not function as repressors, suggesting that targeting of CIR to CBF1 is an important component of repression. When expressed as a Gal4 fusion protein, CIR repressed reporter gene expression. CIR binds to histone deacetylase and to SAP30 and serves as a linker between CBF1 and the histone deacetylase complex."
18305892,Search for cellular partners of human papillomavirus type 16 E2 protein.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect cutaneous and mucosal epithelia. Type 16 (HPV16) displays tropism to genital epithelia, giving rise to genital warts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which is a precursor lesion to invasive carcinoma of the cervix. The great majority of human cervical cancers contain integrated HPV DNA where the E2 gene is usually disrupted, suggesting that the loss of the E2 protein is an important step in HPV-induced carcinogenesis. The HPV16 E2 protein is a regulatory protein that seems to be essential for creating favourable conditions for establishment of infection and proper completion of the viral life cycle. Recently, diverse activities of the E2 proteins have been described, but the molecular basis of these processes has not beenfully elucidated. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified epithelial cellular proteins that bind to the E2 protein of HPV16."
10702269,cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein binds to human papillomavirus E2 protein and activates E2-dependent transcription.,"cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) is a eucaryotic transcriptional co-activator that contains multiple protein-protein interaction domains for association with various transcription factors, components of the basal transcriptional apparatus, and other co-activator proteins. Here, we report that CBP is also a co-activator of the human papillomavirus (HPV) E2 protein, which is a sequence-specific transcription/replication factor. We provide biochemical, genetic, and functional evidence that CBP binds directly to HPV E2 in vivo and in vitro and activates E2-dependent transcription. Mutations in an amphipathic helix within HPV-18 E2 abolish its transcriptional activation properties and its ability to bind to CBP. Furthermore, the binding of CBP to E2 was shown to be necessary for E2-dependent transcription. Interestingly, the histone acetyltransferase activity of CBP plays a role in CBP activation of E2-dependent transcription."
7859281,The Epstein-Barr virus transforming protein LMP1 engages signaling proteins for the tumor necrosis factor receptor family.,"The cytoplasmic C-terminus of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent infection membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is essential for B lymphocyte growth transformation and is now shown to interact with a novel human protein (LMP1-associated protein 1 [LAP1]). LAP1 is homologous to a murine protein, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), implicated in growth signaling from the p80 TNFR. A second novel protein (EBI6), induced by EBV infection, is the human homolog of a second murine TNFR-associated protein (TRAF1). LMP1 expression causes LAP1 and EBI6 to localize to LMP1 clusters in lymphoblast plasma membranes, and LMP1 coimmunoprecipitates with these proteins. LAP1 binds to the p80 TNFR, CD40, and the lymphotoxin-beta receptor, while EBI6 associates with the p80 TNFR. The interaction of LMP1 with these TNFR family-associated proteins is further evidence for their role in signaling and links LMP1-mediated transformation to signal transduction from the TNFR family."
10644344,Hepatitis C virus core protein interacts with 14-3-3 protein and activates the kinase Raf-1.,"Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver dysfunction in humans and is epidemiologically closely associated with the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma. Among HCV components, core protein has been reported to be implicated in cell growth regulation both in vitro and in vivo, although mechanisms explaining those effects are still unclear. In the present study, we identified that members of the 14-3-3 protein family associate with HCV core protein. 14-3-3 protein bound to HCV core protein in a phosphoserine-dependent manner. Introduction of HCV core protein caused a substantial increase in Raf-1 kinase activity in HepG2 cells and in a yeast genetic assay. Furthermore, the HCV core-14-3-3 interaction was essential for Raf-1 kinase activation by HCV core protein. These results suggest that HCV core protein may represent a novel type of Raf-1 kinase-activating protein through its interaction with 14-3-3 protein and may contribute to hepatocyte growth regulation."
15175323,Human papillomavirus 16 E6 oncoprotein interferences with insulin signaling pathway by binding to tuberin.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene. TSC1 and TSC2 products, Harmatin and Tuberin, form the functional complex to serve as the negative regulator for insulin-induced phosphorylation of S6 kinase and elF4E-binding protein 1. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the necessary cause for cervical cancer. E6 oncoprotein encoded by HPV plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis by interference with the host intracellular protein functions. In this study, we show that HPV16 E6 interacts with tumor suppressor gene TSC2 product, Tuberin, and results in the phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6 even in the absence of insulin. The overexpression of Tuberin overcomes the effect of E6 on S6 kinase phosphorylation. Binding with HPV16 E6 causes the proteasome-mediated degradation of Tuberin. A DILG motif and an ELVG motif located in the carboxyl-terminal of Tuberin are required for E6 binding. In addition, the Tuberin interaction region in E6 has been mapped in the amino-terminal portion of HPV16 E6, which is different from the binding domain with p53. These results provide a possible link between E6-induced oncogenesis and the insulin-stimulated cell proliferation signaling pathway."
14675634,The human papillomavirus type 11 and 16 E6 proteins modulate the cell-cycle regulator and transcription cofactor TRIP-Br1.,"The genital human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a taxonomic group including HPV types that preferentially cause genital and laryngeal warts (""low-risk types""), such as HPV-6 and HPV-11, or cancer of the cervix and its precursor lesions (""high-risk types""), such as HPV-16. The transforming processes induced by these viruses depend on the proteins E5, E6, and E7. Among these oncoproteins, the E6 protein stands out because it supports a particularly large number of functions and interactions with cellular proteins, some of which are specific for the carcinogenic HPVs, while others are shared among low- and high-risk HPVs. Here we report yeast two-hybrid screens with HPV-6 and -11 E6 proteins that identified TRIP-Br1 as a novel cellular target. TRIP-Br1 was recently detected by two research groups, which described two separate functions, namely that of a transcriptional integrator of the E2F1/DP1/RB cell-cycle regulatory pathway (and then named TRIP-Br1), and that of an antagonist of the cyclin-dependent kinase suppression of p16INK4a (and then named p34SEI-1). We observed that TRIP-Br1 interacts with low- and high-risk HPV E6 proteins in yeast, in vitro and in mammalian cell cultures. Transcription activation of a complex consisting of E2F1, DP1, and TRIP-Br1 was efficiently stimulated by both E6 proteins. TRIP-Br1 has an LLG E6 interaction motif, which contributed to the binding of E6 proteins. Apparently, E6 does not promote degradation of TRIP-Br1. Our observations imply that the cell-cycle promoting transcription factor E2F1/DP1 is dually targeted by HPV oncoproteins, namely (i) by interference of the E7 protein with repression by RB, and (ii) by the transcriptional cofactor function of the E6 protein. Our data reveal the natural context of the transcription activator function of E6, which has been predicted without knowledge of the E2F1/DP1/TRIP-Br/E6 complex by studying chimeric constructs, and add a function to the limited number of transforming properties shared by low- and high-risk HPVs."
9705868,Human papillomavirus oncoprotein E6 binds to the C-terminal region of human minichromosome maintenance 7 protein.,"Oncoprotein E6 of the human papillomavirus (HPV) associated with cervical cancer (HPV-16 and -18) degrades tumor suppressor protein p53, but seems to have p53-independent transforming functions. We searched for other cellular targets for the N-terminal region of HPV-16 E6 using a yeast two-hybrid system. The E6 was found to bind to the C-terminal region of a human minichromosome maintenance 7 (hMCM7) protein, which is a component of replication licensing factors. The full-length hMCM7 translated in vitro was capable of binding to bacterially expressed E6. In yeast cells the E6s of the cancer-associated HPVs (HPV-16, -18, and -58) bound to hMCM7 more strongly than those of the HPVs associated with a benign tumor (HPV-6 and -11). Binding of E6 with hMCM7 may cause chromosomal abnormalities found in the human cells expressing E6s of oncogenic HPVs."
12813456,Interaction of the HPV E7 proteins with the pCAF acetyltransferase.,"Most cervical carcinomas express the E6 and E7 proteins of a high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). These proteins affect growth control by interfering with the functions of cell regulatory proteins, promoting oncogenic transformation. A key target of E7 is the tumor suppressor protein pRb, which directly interacts with E7. However, binding to additional cellular regulatory proteins is clearly required for oncogenesis, as mutants of E7 have been identified that bind to pRb, yet fail to transform efficiently. Here we demonstrate the interaction of the HPV 6, 16 and 18 E7 proteins with the pCAF acetyltransferase, which has been reported to function as a coactivator for a variety of transcription factors including p53. Mutation of a highly conserved leucine residue within the zinc finger region of HPV 16 E7 disrupts binding to pCAF and also impairs transformation and transcriptional activation. HPV 16 E7 interacts with the acetyltransferase domain of pCAF, and reduces its acetyltransferase activity in vitro. Our analysis of the interaction between the pCAF acetyltransferase and E7 provides new insight into the mechanisms by which the E7 oncoproteins can alter cellular gene expression and growth."
9374493,The human papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein functionally interacts with the S4 subunit of the 26 S proteasome.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been etiologically linked to human cervical cancer. More than 90% of cervical cancer tissues express two HPV-encoded oncoproteins E6 and E7. Both E6 and E7 proteins possess transformation activity. and together they cooperate to transform primary human keratinocytes, fibroblasts. and epithelial cells. The transforming activity of E7 is associated with its ability to bind the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb). However, the carboxyl-terminal mutants of E7 are also defective for transformation, suggesting that other cellular targets for E7 might exist. We screened a human placenta cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid assay using HPV 16 E7 as a bait and identified the subunit 4 (S4) ATPase of the 26 S proteasome as a novel E7-binding protein. E7 binds to S4 through the carboxyl-terminal zinc binding motif, and the binding is independent of E7 sequences involved in binding to Rb. The interaction between S4 and E7 can be easily detected by in vitro protein binding assays. Moreover, we found that E7 increases the ATPase activity of S4. A recent study has shown that, in epithelial cells, E7 degrades Rb through the 26 S proteasome pathway. We hypothesize that E7 might target Rb for degradation by 26 S proteasome through its interaction with the subunit 4 of the proteasome."
9990017,Modulation of type M2 pyruvate kinase activity by the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein.,"We report here that the E7 oncoprotein encoded by the oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 binds to the glycolytic enzyme type M2 pyruvate kinase (M2-PK). M2-PK occurs in a tetrameric form with a high affinity to its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and a dimeric form with a low affinity to phosphoenolpyruvate, and the transition between both conformations regulates the glycolytic flux in tumor cells. The glycolytic intermediate fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate induces the reassociation of the dimeric to the tetrameric form of M2-PK. The expression of E7 in an experimental cell line shifts the equilibrium to the dimeric state despite a significant increase in the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate levels. Investigations of HPV-16 E7 mutants and the nononcogenic HPV-11 subtype suggest that the interaction of HPV-16 E7 with M2-PK may be linked to the transforming potential of the viral oncoprotein."
10228159,The E7 oncoprotein associates with Mi2 and histone deacetylase activity to promote cell growth.,"E7 is the main transforming protein of human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16) which is implicated in the formation of cervical cancer. The transforming activity of E7 has been attributed to its interaction with the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor. However, Rb binding is not sufficient for transformation by E7. Mutations within a zinc finger domain, which is dispensable for Rb binding, also abolish E7 transformation functions. Here we show that HPV16 E7 associates with histone deacetylase in vitro and in vivo, via its zinc finger domain. Using a genetic screen, we identify Mi2beta, a component of the recently identified NURD histone deacetylase complex, as a protein that binds directly to the E7 zinc finger. A zinc finger point mutant which is unable to bind Mi2beta and histone deacetylase but is still able to bind Rb fails to overcome cell cycle arrest in osteosarcoma cells. Our results suggest that the binding to a histone deacetylase complex is an important parameter for the growthpromoting activity of the human papilloma virus E7 protein. This provides the first indication that viral oncoproteins control cell proliferation by targeting deacetylation pathways."
18775702,African swine fever virus protein p30 interaction with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) during infection.,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) was identified as interacting cellular protein with the abundant immediate early protein p30 from African swine fever virus (ASFV) in a macrophage cDNA library screening. The interacting regions of hnRNP-K with p30 were established within residues 35-197, which represent KH1 and KH2 domains responsible for RNA binding. Colocalization of hnRNP-K and p30 was observed mainly in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm of infected cells and infection modified hnRNP-K subcellular distribution and decreased the incorporation of 5-fluorouridine into nascent RNA. Since similar effects were observed in cells transiently expressing p30, this interaction provides new insights into p30 function and could represent a possible additional mechanism by which ASFV downregulates host cell mRNA translation."
10330179,"Btf, a novel death-promoting transcriptional repressor that interacts with Bcl-2-related proteins.","The adenovirus E1B 19,000-molecular-weight (19K) protein is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis and cooperates with E1A to transform primary rodent cells. E1B 19K shows sequence and functional homology to the mammalian antiapoptotic gene product, Bcl-2. Like Bcl-2, the biochemical mechanism of E1B 19K function includes binding to and antagonization of cellular proapoptotic proteins such as Bax, Bak, and Nbk/Bik. In addition, there is evidence that E1B 19K can affect gene expression, but whether this contributes to its antiapoptotic function has not been determined. In an effort to further understand the functions of E1B 19K, we screened for 19K-associated proteins by the yeast two-hybrid system. A novel protein, Btf (Bcl-2-associated transcription factor), that interacts with E1B 19K as well as with the antiapoptotic family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL but not with the proapoptotic protein Bax was identified. btf is a widely expressed gene that encodes a protein with homology to the basic zipper (bZip) and Myb DNA binding domains. Btf binds DNA in vitro and represses transcription in reporter assays. E1B 19K, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL sequester Btf in the cytoplasm and block its transcriptional repression activity. Expression of Btf also inhibited transformation by E1A with either E1B 19K or mutant p53, suggesting a role in either promotion of apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. Indeed, the sustained overexpression of Btf in HeLa cells induced apoptosis, which was inhibited by E1B 19K. Furthermore, the chromosomal localization of btf (6q22-23) maps to a region that is deleted in some cancers, consistent with a role for Btf in tumor suppression. Thus, btf may represent a novel tumor suppressor gene residing in a unique pathway by which the Bcl-2 family can regulate apoptosis."
9020106,Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 forms a complex with the nuclear transporter karyopherin alpha2.,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is implicated in the induction of several malignancies. The nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is the only viral protein that is expressed consistently in all EBV-associated tumors. EBNA1 is involved in the replication and maintenance of the viral episome in the infected cell and exhibits oncogenic activity in transgenic mice. Here we report the identification of the nuclear transporter karyopherin alpha2 as a cellular partner of EBNA1 using the yeast ""two-hybrid system."" Karyopherin alpha2 is also called importin alpha or Rch1. The binding to karyopherin alpha2 was mediated through a C-terminal region of EBNA1 encompassing the nuclear localization signal, whereas clones of EBNA1 devoid of the nuclear localization signal failed to bind to karyopherin alpha2. The interaction was biochemically confirmed by far-Western analysis using bacterially expressed karyopherin alpha2 and karyopherin alpha2-specific monoclonal antibodies. The nuclear transport of EBNA1 was impaired by expression of N-terminally truncated karyopherin alpha2. Zone velocity sedimentation in a sucrose gradient indicated that: (i) EBNA1 and Rch1 colocalize; and (ii) the association of karyopherin alpha2 with high molecular weight protein complexes might be impeded by the presence of EBNA1."
10544080,Hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase and NS5A complex with a SNARE-like protein.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A is a phosphoprotein that possesses a cryptic trans-activation activity. To investigate its potential role in viral replication, we searched for the cellular proteins interacting with NS5A protein by yeast two-hybrid screening of a human hepatocyte cDNA library. We identified a newly discovered soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor-like protein termed human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein of 33 kDa (hVAP-33). In vitro binding assay and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed the interaction between hVAP-33 and NS5A. Interestingly, hVAP-33 was also shown to interact with NS5B, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. NS5A and NS5B bind to different domains of hVAP-33: NS5A binds to the C-terminus, whereas NS5B binds to the N-terminus of hVAP-33. Immunofluorescent staining showed a significant colocalization of hVAP-33 with both NS5A and NS5B proteins. hVAP-33 contains a coiled-coil domain followed by a membrane-spanning domain at its C-terminus. Cell fractionation analysis revealed that hVAP-33 is predominantly associated with the ER, the Golgi complex, and the prelysosomal membrane, consistent with its potential role in intracellular membrane trafficking. These interactions provide a mechanism for membrane association of the HCV RNA replication complex and further suggest that NS5A is a part of the viral RNA replication complex."
9671498,Disruption of PML subnuclear domains by the acidic IE1 protein of human cytomegalovirus is mediated through interaction with PML and may modulate a RING finger-dependent cryptic transactivator function of PML.,"Both of the major immediate-early (IE) proteins IE1 and IE2 of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) as well as input viral DNA and sites of viral IE transcription colocalize with or adjacent to punctate PML domains (PML oncogenic domains [PODs] or nuclear domain 10) in the nucleus within the first few hours after infection of permissive human fibroblasts. However, colocalization of IE1 and PML in PODs is only transient, with both proteins subsequently redistributing into a nuclear diffuse form. These processes are believed to promote efficient viral IE transcription and initiation of DNA synthesis especially at low multiplicities of infection. To examine the mechanism of PML displacement by IE1, we carried out indirect immunofluorescence assay experiments with plasmids expressing intact or deleted forms of PML and IE1 in DNA-transfected cells. The results demonstrated that deletion of the C-terminal acidic region of IE1 uncouples the requirements for displacement of both endogenous and coexpressed PML from those needed to target to the PODs. Mutant PML proteins containing either a Cys point mutation within the N-terminal RING finger domain or a small deletion (of positions 281 to 304) within the coiled-coil region did not localize to the PODs but instead gave a nuclear diffuse distribution, similar to that produced by intact PML in the presence of IE1. Endogenous PML also colocalized with IE1 in metaphase chromosomes in HCMV or recombinant adenovirus type 5-IE1-infected HF cells undergoing mitosis, implying that there may be a direct physical interaction between IE1 and PML. Indeed, a specific interaction between IE1 and PML was observed in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and the strength of this interaction was comparable to that of IE2 with the retinoblastoma protein. The RING finger mutant form of PML showed a threefold-lower interaction with IE1 in the yeast system, and deletion of the N-terminal RING finger domain of PML abolished the interaction. Consistent with the IFA results, a mutant IE1 protein that lacks the C-terminal acidic region was sufficient for interaction with PML in the yeast system. The two-hybrid interaction assay also showed that both the N-terminal RING finger domain and the intact coiled-coil region of PML are required cooperatively for efficient self-interactions involving dimerization or oligomerization. Furthermore, truncated or deleted GAL4/PML fusion proteins that retained the RING finger domain but lacked the intact coiled-coil region displayed an unmasked cryptic transactivator function in both yeast and mammalian cells, and the RING finger mutation abolished this transactivation property of PML. Therefore, we suggest that a direct interaction between IE1 and the N-terminal RING finger domain of PML may inhibit oligomerization and protein-protein complex formation by PML, leading to displacement of PML and IE1 from the PODs, and that this interaction may also modulate a putative conditional transactivator function of PML."
10336476,Hepatitis C virus core protein binds to a DEAD box RNA helicase.,"Approximately 4 million Americans are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), making it a major cause of chronic liver disease. Because of the lack of an efficient cell culture system, little is known about the interaction between HCV and host cells. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human liver cell cDNA library with HCV core protein as bait and isolated the DEAD box protein DBX. DBX has significant amino acid sequence identity to mouse PL10, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase. The binding of DBX to HCV core protein occurred in an in vitro binding assay in the presence of 1 M NaCl or detergent. When expressed in mammalian cells, HCV core protein and DBX were co-localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. In a mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DBX complemented the function of Ded1p, an essential DEAD box RNA helicase. HCV core protein inhibited the growth of DBX-complemented mutant yeast but not Ded1p-expressing yeast. HCV core protein also inhibited the in vitro translation of capped but not uncapped RNA. These findings demonstrate an interaction between HCV core protein and a host cell protein involved in RNA translation and suggest a mechanism by which HCV may inhibit host cell mRNA translation."
11373297,"The cellular protein PRA1 modulates the anti-apoptotic activity of Epstein-Barr virus BHRF1, a homologue of Bcl-2, through direct interaction.","The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded early protein, BHRF1, is a structural and functional homologue of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2. There is accumulating evidence that BHRF1 protects a variety of cell types from apoptosis induced by various external stimuli. To identify specific proteins from normal epithelial cells that interact with BHRF1 and that might promote or inhibit its anti-apoptotic activity, we screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library derived from human normal foreskin keratinocytes and identified a cellular gene encoding human prenylated rab acceptor 1 (hPRA1). The interaction of hPRA1 with BHRF1 was confirmed using glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation. Two regions of PRA1, amino acids 30-53 and the carboxyl-terminal 21 residues, are important for BHRF1 interactions and two regions of BHRF1, amino acids 1-18 and 89-142, including the Bcl-2 homology domains BH4 and BH1, respectively, are crucial for PRA1 interactions. PRA1 expression interferes with the anti-apoptotic activity of BHRF1, although not of Bcl-2. These results indicate that the PRA1 interacts selectively with BHRF1 to reduce its anti-apoptotic activity and might play a role in the impeding completion of virus maturation."
11753645,The HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein binds Skip and suppresses its transcriptional activity.,"E7 is the major transforming protein of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is implicated in the development of cervical cancer. The transforming activity of E7 has been attributed in part to its interaction with the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor; however, the Rb interaction alone is not sufficient for transformation by E7. In a screen for cellular targets of HPV E7, we identified the Ski interacting protein, Skip, as a new interacting partner of E7. We show that HPV-16 E7 associates with Skip via sequences in its carboxy terminal region, and the evolutionarily conserved proline rich sequences (PRS) of the SNW domain of Skip. E7 functionally targets Skip in vivo and inhibits its transcriptional activation activity. Two transformation defective mutants of E7 were identified that failed both to bind Skip and to inhibit its transcriptional activity. These results suggest that inhibition of Skip function may contribute to cell transformation by HPV-16 E7."
9660940,"A novel human WD protein, h-beta TrCp, that interacts with HIV-1 Vpu connects CD4 to the ER degradation pathway through an F-box motif.","HIV-1 Vpu interacts with CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum and triggers CD4 degradation, presumably by proteasomes. Human beta TrCP identified by interaction with Vpu connects CD4 to this proteolytic machinery, and CD4-Vpu-beta TrCP ternary complexes have been detected by coimmunoprecipitation. beta TrCP binding to Vpu and its recruitment to membranes require two phosphoserine residues in Vpu essential for CD4 degradation. In beta TrCP, WD repeats at the C terminus mediate binding to Vpu, and an F box near the N terminus is involved in interaction with Skp1p, a targeting factor for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. An F-box deletion mutant of beta TrCP had a dominant-negative effect on Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation. These data suggest that beta TrCP and Skp1p represent components of a novel ER-associated protein degradation pathway that mediates CD4 proteolysis."
9683573,"A novel human DnaJ protein, hTid-1, a homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor protein Tid56, can interact with the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein.","We have cloned hTid-1, a human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor protein Tid56, by virtue of its ability to form complexes with the human papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein. The carboxyl terminal cysteine-rich metal binding domain of E7 is the major determinant for interaction with hTid-1. The carboxyl terminus of E7 is essential for the functional and structural integrity of E7 and has previously been shown to function as a multimerization domain. The hTid-1 protein is a member of the DnaJ-family of chaperones. Its mRNA is widely expressed in human tissues, including the HPV-18-positive cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa and human genital keratinocytes, the normal host cells of the HPVs. The hTid-1 gene has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 16. The large tumor antigens of polyomaviruses encode functional J-domains that are important for viral replication as well as cellular transformation. The ability of HPV E7 to interact with a cellular DnaJ protein suggests that these two viral oncoproteins may target common regulatory pathways through J-domains."
10702232,Inactivation of interferon regulatory factor-1 tumor suppressor protein by HPV E7 oncoprotein. Implication for the E7-mediated immune evasion mechanism in cervical carcinogenesis.,"In studying biological roles of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 tumor suppressor in cervical carcinogenesis, we found that HPV E7 is functionally associated with IRF-1. Binding assays indicate a physical interaction between IRF-1 and HPV E7 in vivo and in vitro. The carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of IRF-1 was required for the interaction. Transient co-expression of E7 significantly inhibits the IRF-1-mediated activation of IFN-beta promoter in NIH-3T3 cells. Co-transfection of E7 mutants reveals that the pRb-binding portion of E7 is necessary for the E7-mediated inactivation of IRF-1. It was next determined whether histone deacetylase (HDAC) is involved in the inactivation mechanism as recently suggested, where the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain of E7 associates with NURD complex containing HDAC. When trichostatin A, an inhibitor of HDAC, was treated, the repressing activity of E7 was released in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the mutation of zinc finger abrogates such activity without effect on the interaction with IRF-1. These results suggest that HPV E7 interferes with the transactivation function of IRF-1 by recruiting HDAC to the promoter. The immune-promoting role of IRF-1 evokes the idea that our novel finding might be important for the elucidation of the E7-mediated immune evading mechanism that is frequently found in cervical cancer."
15073179,The human papillomavirus 16 E6 protein binds to Fas-associated death domain and protects cells from Fas-triggered apoptosis.,"High risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), such as HPV 16, cause human cervical carcinoma. The E6 protein of HPV 16 mediates the rapid degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, although this is not the only function of E6 and cannot completely explain its transforming potential. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that E6 can protect cells from tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis by binding to the C-terminal end of tumor necrosis factor R1, thus blocking apoptotic signal transduction. In this study, E6 was shown to also protect cells from apoptosis induced via the Fas pathway. Furthermore, use of an inducible E6 expression system demonstrated that this protection is dose-dependent, with higher levels of E6 leading to greater protection. Although E6 suppresses activation of both caspase 3 and caspase 8, it does not affect apoptotic signaling through the mitochondrial pathway. Mammalian two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays were then used to demonstrate that E6 binds directly to the death effector domain of Fas-associated death domain (FADD), with deletion and site-directed mutants enabling the localization of the E6-binding site to the N-terminal end of the FADD death effector domain. E6 is produced in two forms as follows: a full-length version of approximately 16 kDa and a smaller version of about half that size corresponding to the N-terminal half of the full-length protein. Pull-down and functional assays demonstrated that the full-length version, but not the small version of E6, was able to bind to FADD and to protect cells from Fas-induced apoptosis. In addition, binding to E6 leads to degradation of FADD, with the loss of cellular FADD proportional to the amount of E6 expressed. These results support a model in which E6-mediated degradation of FADD prevents transmission of apoptotic signals via the Fas pathway."
12482659,Interaction of human papillomavirus type 16 L2 with cellular proteins: identification of novel nuclear body-associated proteins.,"Two structural proteins form the Papillomavirus (PV) capsids. While the functions of the major structural protein L1 are well established, the exact functions for the minor structural protein L2 are much less well defined, except for some information on a role in viral entry and maturation of infectious virions. To gain more insight in the function of L2 we used the yeast two hybrid system with the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 11 L2 and HPV16 L2 as bait proteins to isolate putative cellular interaction partners. We identified four proteins interacting with L2 proteins of at least two different HPV types and this interaction was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assays. Further evidence for this interaction was obtained by in vivo localization studies. Two of the proteins, the previously described PATZ and a novel protein, designated PLINP, were localized in discrete nuclear domains and colocalized with L2. The third protein, designated PMSP, is a newly identified cytoplasmic protein which was recruited to nuclear dots when coexpressed with L2. The fourth protein interacting with HPV16, 11 and 1 L2, the tubular-nephritis antigen related protein (TIN-Ag-RP), shows a cytoplasmic as well as a membrane bound subcellular distribution. Taken together, our data indicate that L2 of HPVs with different phenotypes interacts with several cellular host proteins, recruits one of them to the nucleus, and is complexed with at least three cellular proteins in specific nuclear domains. These findings suggest an HPV type-independent modulatory function of L2 on host-cell functions that involves discrete nuclear domains and alteration of the subcellular distribution of cellular proteins. The interacting cellular proteins identified may play a role in the viral life cycle and establishment of viral persistence."
10498661,Hepatitis C virus core protein binds to apolipoprotein AII and its secretion is modulated by fibrates.,"Several lines of evidence suggest that hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein may modulate cellular transduction signals and alter lipid metabolism. We have investigated the binding of HCV core protein to cellular proteins by combining 2 yeast hybrid, confocal, and surface plasmon resonance assays. Our results show the direct binding of the viral protein to apolipoprotein AII (apoAII) and map the interaction domain to the C-terminal of HCV core protein. To investigate the biological relevance of the interaction between HCV core and lipid metabolism, we took advantage of the well-established increase in apoAII expression caused by fibrates in HepG2 cells. After fenofibric acid treatment, we show a parallel increase in apoAII and core protein secretion, this effect being abolished by brefeldin A. Our study identifies apoAII as one of the cellular targets for HCV core protein. We also show that the intervention of fenofibric acid in cellular lipid metabolism directly affects the expression pattern of HCV core protein."
12435599,Stimulation of IKK-gamma oligomerization by the human T-cell leukemia virus oncoprotein Tax.,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 oncoprotein Tax activates NF-kappaB through direct binding to IKK-gamma, the regulatory component of the IkappaB kinase complex. Mechanisms by which IKK-gamma adapts the Tax signal to the IkappaB kinase are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that IKK-gamma forms homodimer and homotrimer both in vitro and in yeast or mammalian cells through a C-terminal domain comprising amino acids 251-419. In contrast, Tax protein targets a central region of IKK-gamma, which consists of amino acids 201-250. Interestingly, Tax stimulates the oligomerization of IKK-gamma, likely through direct binding. Taken together, our findings suggest a new model of Tax activation of NF-kappaB, in which Tax interacts with IKK-gamma to stimulate its oligomerization."
9792841,The vaccinia virus E3L gene product interacts with both the regulatory and the substrate binding regions of PKR: implications for PKR autoregulation.,"The vaccinia virus E3L gene product, pE3, is a dsRNA binding protein that prevents activation of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated protein kinase, PKR. Activation of PKR, which results in phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor, eIF2alpha, leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis, a process involved in defense against virus infection. The E3L gene product has a conserved dsRNA binding domain (DRBD) in its carboxyl-terminal region and has been shown to function in vitro by sequestration of dsRNA. We have utilized in vitro binding assays and the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate direct interactions of pE3 with PKR. By these methods, we demonstrate that pE3 interacts with two distinct regions in PKR, the amino-terminal (amino acids 1-99) located in the regulatory domain and the carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 367-523) located in the catalytic domain. The amino-terminal region of PKR that interacts with pE3 contains a conserved DRBD, suggesting that PKR can form nonfunctional heterodimers with pE3, analogous to those seen with other dsRNA binding proteins. Interaction of pE3 with the amino-terminal region of PKR is enhanced by dsRNA. In contrast, dsRNA reduces the interaction of pE3 with the carboxyl-terminal region of PKR. Competition experiments demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal region of PKR, to which pE3 binds, overlaps the region with which eIF2alpha and the pseudosubstrate pK3 interact, suggesting that pE3 may also prevent PKR activation by masking the substrate binding domain. Like pE3, the amino-terminal region of PKR also interacts with the carboxyl-terminal domain of PKR. These interactions increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which pE3 downregulates PKR. In addition, the PKR-PKR interactions observed leads us to suggest a novel autoregulatory mechanism for activation of PKR in which dsRNA binding to the DRBD(s) induces a conformational change that results in release of the amino terminal region from the substrate binding domain, allowing access to eIF2alpha and its subsequent phosphorylation."
8816500,"Induction of apoptosis by human Nbk/Bik, a BH3-containing protein that interacts with E1B 19K.","The E1B 19-kilodalton protein (19K protein) is a potent apoptosis inhibitor and the adenovirus homolog of Bcl-2 (E. White, Genes Dev. 10:1-15, 1996). To obtain a better understanding of the biochemical mechanism by which the E1B 19K protein regulates apoptosis, proteins that interact with 19K have been identified; one of these is Bax (J. Han, P. Sabbatini, D. Perez, L. Rao, D. Mohda, and E. White, Genes Dev. 10:461-477, 1996), and another is Bak (S. N. Farrow, J. H. M. White, I. Martinou, T. Raven, K.-T. Pun, C. J. Grinham, J.-C. Martinou, and R. Brown, Nature (London) 374:731-733, 1995). Bax and Bak are Bcl-2 family members which contain Bcl-2 homology regions 1, 2, and 3 (BH1, BH2, and BH3), which interact with E1B 19K and Bcl-2 and promote apoptosis. Like Bax and Bak, Nbk was cloned from a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with E1B 19K. Nbk contained BH3 but not BH1 or BH2. It also interacted with Bcl-2 but not with Bax. Both Bcl-2 and E1B 19K interacted with Nbk in vitro, and this interaction was highly specific. In vivo, the Nbk and E1B 19K proteins may colocalize with cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes. Nbk expression functionally antagonized 19K-mediated inhibition of apoptotic cell death and completely prevented transformation by E1A and E1B 19K. Nbk was sufficient for induction of apoptosis in the presence of mutant p53 and thus low levels of Bax, suggesting that Nbk functions independently of Bax to induce apoptosis. Nbk may therefore represent a novel death regulator which contains only a BH3 that interacts with and antagonizes apoptosis inhibitors such as the E1B 19K protein."
8600029,The E1B 19K protein blocks apoptosis by interacting with and inhibiting the p53-inducible and death-promoting Bax protein.,"The E1B 19K protein is a potent apoptosis inhibitor and the putative adenovirus Bcl-2 homolog. To investigate the mechanism of apoptosis regulation, 19K-interacting cellular proteins were identified using the yeast two-hybrid system, and Bax was one of seven 19-K interacting clones. Residues 50-78 of Bax containing a conserved region designated Bcl-2 homology region 3 (BH3) were sufficient for specific binding to both the E1B 19K and Bcl-2 proteins. The Bax-E1B 19K interaction was detectable in vitro and in lysates from mammalian cells, and Bax expression antagonized E1B 19K protein function. bax mRNA and protein levels were p53-inducible with kinetics identical to that of p21/Waf-1/Cip-1, and E1B 19K and Bcl-2 expression did not affect Bax or p21/Waf-1/Cip-1 accumulation. In cells where p53 was mutant, Bax expression induced apoptosis, suggesting that Bax was sufficient for apoptosis, and acted downstream of p53. p53 may simultaneously activate the transcription of genes required for both growth arrest (p21/Waf-1/Cip-1) and death (bax), and E1B 19K and Bcl-2 may act distally and function through interaction with and antagonism of Bax to prevent apoptosis. With the death pathway disabled, induction of growth arrest by p53 can then be manifested."
7715729,Cloning of a bcl-2 homologue by interaction with adenovirus E1B 19K.,"A number of DNA viruses carry apoptosis-inhibiting genes which enable the virus to escape from the host response. The adenovirus E1B 19K protein can inhibit apoptosis induced by E1A, tumour-necrosis factor-alpha, FAS antigen and nerve growth factor deprivation. The molecular basis of this inhibition remains poorly understood, but the fact that protection is seen in the absence of other viral proteins suggests that E1B 19K targets cellular proteins. We report here the identification of three cellular proteins that bind E1B 19K. One of these is a new member of the bcl-2 family, which we have called bak (for bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer). This protein, which is expressed in a wide variety of cell types, binds to E1B 19K and to the Bcl-2 homologue Bcl-XL (ref. 17) in yeast. In addition, overexpression of bak in sympathetic neurons deprived of nerve growth factor accelerates apoptosis and blocks the protective effect of co-injected E1B 19K."
11275986,"Functional inactivation of p73, a homolog of p53 tumor suppressor protein, by human papillomavirus E6 proteins.","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is strongly implicated as a causative agent in the etiology of cervical cancer. Of its gene products, E6 binds to and inactivates p53 tumor suppressor protein by ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation. Recently, p73, a novel family of p53, has been identified and demonstrated, like p53, to activate p21(WAF1). Here we show that p73 is also inactivated by HPV-E6, but ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is not responsive. Yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays indicate a physical interaction between p73 and either HPV-16 or HPV-11 E6 proteins in vivo and in vitro, respectively. The transactivation domain (amino acid residues 1 to 49) is found to be absolutely required for the interaction. Transient co-expression of E6 significantly inhibits the p73-mdiated activation of p21(WAF1) promoter in a p53-defective C33A cell line. Using Gal4-p73 fusion protein, we demonstrate that E6 inhibition of p73 transactivation function is independent of sequence-specific DNA binding, which is confirmed by a direct electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Moreover, E6 inhibits p73 function by interfering with the activity of the amino-terminal activation domain. Co-transfection of E6 mutants reveals that the same portion of E6 appears to be responsible for the inactivation of p53 and p73 function. However, the inactivation mechanism of p73 is clearly different from that of p53, because p73, unlike p53, is inactivated by both high- and low-risk E6s and is not susceptible to E6-dependent proteolysis. These overall results, consequently, suggest that in addition to the inactivation of p53, the functional interference of p73 by HPV-E6 may, at least in part, contribute to E6-mediated transformation and hyperproliferation of cervical cells."
9649509,Human papillomavirus 16 E6 oncoprotein binds to interferon regulatory factor-3 and inhibits its transcriptional activity.,Interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) was found to specifically interact with HPV16 E6 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. IRF-3 is activated by the presence of double-stranded RNA or by virus infection to form a stable complex with other transcriptional regulators that bind to the regulatory elements of the IFNbeta promoter. We show that IRF-3 is a potent transcriptional activator and demonstrate that HPV16 E6 can inhibit its transactivation function. The expression of HPV16 E6 in primary human keratinocytes inhibits the induction of IFNbeta mRNA following Sendai virus infection. The binding of HPV16 E6 to IRF-3 does not result in its ubiquitination or degradation. We propose that the interaction of E6 with IRF-3 and the inhibition of IRF-3's transcriptional activity may provide the virus a means to circumvent the normal antiviral response of an HPV16-infected cell.
9223484,"Two classes of human papillomavirus type 16 E1 mutants suggest pleiotropic conformational constraints affecting E1 multimerization, E2 interaction, and interaction with cellular proteins.","Random mutagenesis of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E1 was used to generate E1 missense mutants defective for interaction with either hUBC9 or 16E1-BP, two cDNAs encoding proteins that have been identified by their ability to interact with HPV16 E1 in two-hybrid assays. hUBC9, the human counterpart of Saccharomyces cerevisiae UBC9, is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme known to be involved in cell cycle progression. 16E1-BP encodes a protein of no known function but does contain an ATPase signature motif. Eight hUBC9 or 16E1-BP interaction-defective HPV16 E1 missense mutants were identified and characterized for origin-dependent transient DNA replication, ATPase activity, and various protein-protein interaction phenotypes. Six of these mutant E1 proteins were significantly impaired for replication. Among these, two classes of replication-defective HPV16 E1 missense mutants were observed. One class, represented by the S330R replication-defective mutant (containing an S-to-R change at position 330), remained competent for all protein-protein interactions tested, with the exception of hUBC9 association. Furthermore, this mutant, unlike the other replication-defective HPV16 E1 missense mutants, had a strong dominant negative replication phenotype in transient-replication assays. The other class, represented by five of the missense mutants, was defective for multiple protein-protein interactions, usually including, but not limited to, the interaction defect for which each mutant was originally selected. In many cases, a single missense mutation in one region of HPV16 E1 had pleiotropic effects, even upon activities thought to be associated with other domains of HPV16 E1. This suggests that E1 proteins are not modular but may instead be composed of multiple structurally and/or functionally interdependent domains."
12951035,"Adenovirus ADP protein (E3-11.6K), which is required for efficient cell lysis and virus release, interacts with human MAD2B.","The human subgroup C adenovirus (Ad) protein named adenovirus death protein (ADP) (previously named E3-11.6K) is synthesized at very late stages of infection when it mediates efficient lysis of cells and release of adenovirus to infect other cells. ADP is an integral membrane N-linked, O-linked palmitoylated glycoprotein of 101 amino acids (aa) that localizes to the nuclear membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi. It has a single membrane spanning region (roughly aa 40-60) and is oriented with aa 1-40 in the lumen and aa 61-101 in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Using aa 61-101 of Ad2 ADP as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated a cDNA for a 211-aa protein that initially was not in the database but has now been published by others with the names human MAD2B, MAD2L2, and REV7. ADP binds strongly to human MAD2B not only in yeast but also in GST pull-down experiments and in coimmunoprecipitations of ADP and MAD2B synthesized in vitro or in vivo. ADP mutants with deletions throughout the bait region do not interact with human MAD2B, whereas a Pro69Pro70 to Ala69Ala70 mutant in the ""basic-proline"" domain of ADP does interact. Northern blot analyses indicate that human MAD2B is expressed ubiquitously. Human MAD2B is about 25% identical to human MAD2, a spindle assembly checkpoint protein. Two human A549 cell lines were made that constitutively overexpress MAD2B. Wild-type adenovirus lyses these cells significantly more slowly than it lyses parental A549 cells, raising the possibility that ADP and MAD2B act in opposition and suggesting that the ADP-MAD2B interaction is biologically relevant."
15983032,BRCA1 interaction with human papillomavirus oncoproteins.,"Previously, we reported that BRCA1 strongly represses the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) in human breast and prostate cancer cells but only weakly inhibits ER-alpha in cervical cancer cells. We now report that introduction of the human papillomavirus E7 or E6 oncogenes into human papillomavirus-negative cells rescues the BRCA1 repression of ER-alpha activity and that the E7 and E6 oncoproteins interact directly with BRCA1 in vitro and associate with BRCA1 in vivo in cultured cells. This interaction involves at least two contact points on BRCA1, one within an N-terminal site shown previously to interact with ER-alpha and the other in a C-terminal region of BRCA1 containing the first BRCA1 C-terminal domain. Point mutations within the zinc finger domains of E7 and E6 inactivated the binding to the N terminus of BRCA1 and reduced their ability to rescue BRCA1 inhibition of ER-alpha. E6 and E7 also antagonized the ability of BRCA1 to inhibit c-Myc E-box-mediated transactivation and human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter activity, in a manner dependent upon the zinc finger domains. Finally, the ability of E6 and E7 to antagonize BRCA1 did not involve proteolytic degradation of BRCA1. These findings suggest functional interactions of BRCA1 with E7 and E6. The potential significance of these findings is discussed."
11309377,The nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 interacts with hepatitis delta antigens and modulates the hepatitis delta virus RNA replication.,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) encodes two isoforms of delta antigens (HDAgs). The small form of HDAg is required for HDV RNA replication, while the large form of HDAg inhibits the viral replication and is required for virion assembly. In this study, we found that the expression of B23, a nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in disparate functions including nuclear transport, cellular proliferation, and ribosome biogenesis, is up-regulated by these two HDAgs. Using in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches, we have demonstrated that both isoforms of HDAg can interact with B23 and their interaction domains were identified as the NH(2)-terminal fragment of each molecule encompassing the nuclear localization signal but not the coiled-coil region of HDAg. Sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis indicated that the majority of small HDAg, but a lesser amount of the large HDAg, co-sedimented with B23 and nucleolin in the large nuclear complex. Transient transfection experiments also indicated that introducing exogenous full-length B23, but not a mutated B23 defective in HDAg binding, enhanced HDV RNA replication. All together, our results reveal that HDAg has two distinct effects on nucleolar B23, up-regulation of its gene expression and the complex formation, which in turn regulates HDV RNA replication. Therefore, this work demonstrates the important role of nucleolar protein in regulating the HDV RNA replication through the complex formation with the key positive regulator being small HDAg."
11576548,Inhibition of Src by direct interaction with protein phosphatase 2A.,"In this study, we report that Src kinase is inhibited by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase. We carried out experiments in vitro using purified PP2A (AC dimer) and full-length v-Src or truncated forms of v-Src. The inhibition of v-Src by PP2A is concentration- and time-dependent. Addition of okadaic acid, a PP2A phosphatase inhibitor, abolished the PP2A-dependent inhibition of v-Src. When experiments were carried out at 4 degrees C under conditions where PP2A activity is inhibited, Src activity was unaffected by the presence of PP2A, suggesting that PP2A binding alone is insufficient to block Src activity. These results imply that PP2A activity is essential for inhibition of v-Src. We also demonstrate that PP2A binds to the catalytic and the regulatory domains of v-Src."
9858596,"The E6 oncoproteins of high-risk papillomaviruses bind to a novel putative GAP protein, E6TP1, and target it for degradation.","The high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with carcinomas of the cervix and other genital tumors. Previous studies have identified two viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, which are expressed in the majority of HPV-associated carcinomas. The ability of high-risk HPV E6 protein to immortalize human mammary epithelial cells (MECs) has provided a single-gene model to study the mechanisms of E6-induced oncogenic transformation. In this system, the E6 protein targets the p53 tumor suppressor protein for degradation, and mutational analyses have shown that E6-induced degradation of p53 protein is required for MEC immortalization. However, the inability of most dominant-negative p53 mutants to induce efficient immortalization of MECs suggests the existence of additional targets of the HPV E6 oncoprotein. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have isolated a novel E6-binding protein. This polypeptide, designated E6TP1 (E6-targeted protein 1), exhibits high homology to GTPase-activating proteins for Rap, including SPA-1, tuberin, and Rap1GAP. The mRNA for E6TP1 is widely expressed in tissues and in vitro-cultured cell lines. The gene for E6TP1 localizes to chromosome 14q23.2-14q24.3 within a locus that has been shown to undergo loss of heterozygosity in malignant meningiomas. Importantly, E6TP1 is targeted for degradation by the high-risk but not the low-risk HPV E6 proteins both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the immortalization-competent but not the immortalization-incompetent HPV16 E6 mutants target the E6TP1 protein for degradation. Our results identify a novel target for the E6 oncoprotein and provide a potential link between HPV E6 oncogenesis and alteration of a small G protein signaling pathway."
11934899,A Functional interaction between the human papillomavirus 16 transcription/replication factor E2 and the DNA damage response protein TopBP1.,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) transcription/replication factor E2 is essential for the life cycle of HPVs. E2 protein binds to DNA target sequences in the viral long control regions to regulate transcription of the viral genome. It also enhances viral DNA replication by interacting with the viral replication factor E1 and recruiting it to the origin of replication and may also play a more direct role in replication. The cellular proteins with which E2 interacts to carry out these functions are largely unknown. To identify these proteins a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out with the transcription/replication domain of HPV16 E2. This screen identified several candidate interacting partners for E2 including TopBP1 (topoisomerase II beta-binding protein 1). TopBP1 has eight BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal domains that are found in proteins regulating the DNA damage response, transcription, and replication. Here we demonstrate that HPV16 E2 and TopBP1 interact in vitro and in vivo and that TopBP1 can enhance the ability of E2 to activate transcription and replication. This is the first time that TopBP1 has been shown to function as a transcriptional coactivator and that E2 interacts with TopBP1. Removal of the amino-terminal domain of TopBP1 abolishes coactivation of transcription and replication. This interaction may have functional consequences upon the viral life cycle."
8386265,Human papillomavirus type 16 E7 associates with a histone H1 kinase and with p107 through sequences necessary for transformation.,"The transforming function of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E7 has been shown to depend on activities additional to the ability to bind RB. In this paper we describe two further properties of E7 which may also contribute to transformation, an association with a histone H1 kinase at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and an ability to bind the RB-related protein p107. The region of E7 identified previously as important for RB binding was found to be involved in the association with the kinase and complex formation with p107, although analysis of E7 point mutants within this region revealed a difference in the precise sequence requirement for RB and p107 binding. Association with the kinase activity correlated with the ability to bind RB, but the restriction of the kinase association to the G2/M phase of the cell cycle implies that this activity might not be directly mediated by RB binding. Since kinase-binding-deficient E7 mutants are also transformation defective, this may represent an independent function of E7 which plays a role in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle."
8627785,"The amino-terminal domains of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear proteins 3A, 3B, and 3C interact with RBPJ(kappa).","The ability of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent infection nuclear protein EBNA3C to activate transcription of two EBNA2-responsive genes and to inhibit EBNA2 activation of transcription in transient-transfection assays appears to be due to its ability to interact with RBPJkappa, a cell protein that links EBNA2 to its response elements. We now show that EBNA3A and EBNA3B expressed in non-EBV-infected Burkitt tumor lymphoblasts are similar to EBNA3C in binding to glutathione S-transferase-RBPJkappa in vitro and in coimmunoprecipitating from cell lysates with antibody to RBPJkappa. EBNA3A and EBNA3B can also inhibit the interaction of RBPJkappa with cognate DNA in vitro. Although EBNA3 open reading frames are each close to 1,000 codons long, EBNA3A amino acids 1 to 138, EBNA3B amino acids 1 to 311, and EBNA3C amino acids 1 to 183 are sufficient for RBPJkappa interaction, while EBNA3B amino acids I to 109 have less or no binding. The RBPJkappa interacting domains overlap with the most highly conserved domain (amino acids 90 to 320) among the EBNA3 proteins. Thus, the EBNA3 gene family appears to have evolved to differentially regulate promoters with RBPJkappa binding sites. EBNA2, EBNA3A, and EBNA3C are important in EBV transformation of primary human B lymphocytes. Their interaction with RBPJkappa links EBV transformation to the notch signaling pathway and the effects of activated notch in T-cell leukemogenesis."
11581372,Adenovirus DNA binding protein interacts with the SNF2-related CBP activator protein (SrCap) and inhibits SrCap-mediated transcription.,"The SNF2-related CBP activator protein, SrCap (pronounced ""sir cap""), shares homology with the SNF2/SWI2 protein family. SrCap was cloned through its ability to bind CBP. SrCap can function as a CBP coactivator and can activate transcription in a reporter assay when expressed as a Gal-SrCap fusion protein. A monoclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of SrCap coimmunoprecipitates CBP/p300, supporting the model that SrCap is a CBP binding protein and that these proteins can be found together in a cellular protein complex. In addition, several cellular proteins are coimmunoprecipitated by the SrCap-specific antibody. Since adenovirus E1A proteins interact with CBP/p300 proteins, we examined what proteins could be copurified in a SrCap-specific coimmunoprecipitation assay from lysates of adenovirus-infected cells. While E1A proteins were not detected in this complex, to our surprise, we observed the presence of an infected-cell-specific band of 72 kDa, which we suspected might be the adenovirus DNA binding protein, DBP. The adenovirus DBP is a multifunctional protein involved in several aspects of the adenovirus life cycle, including an ability to modulate transcription. The identity of DBP was confirmed by DBP-specific Western blot analysis and by reimmunoprecipitating DBP from denatured SrCap-specific protein complexes. Using in vitro-translated DBP and SrCap proteins, we demonstrated that these proteins interact. To determine whether this interaction could affect SrCap-mediated transcription, we tested whether increasing amounts of DBP could modulate the Gal-SrCap transcription activity. We observed that DBP inhibited Gal-SrCap transcription activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest a novel mechanism of adenovirus host cell control by which DBP binds to and inactivates SrCap, a member of the SNF2 chromatin-remodeling protein family."
10747932,Genetic analysis of a potential zinc-binding domain of the adenovirus E4 34k protein.,"E4 34k, the product of adenovirus early region 4 (E4) open reading frame 6, modulates viral late gene expression, viral DNA replication, apoptosis, double strand break repair, and transformation through multiple interactions with components in infected and transformed cells. Conservation of several cysteine and histidine residues among E4 34k sequences from a variety of adenovirus serotypes suggests the presence of a zinc binding domain important for function. Consistent with the hypothesis that E4 34k is a zinc metalloprotein, zinc binding by baculovirus-expressed E4 34k protein was demonstrated in a zinc blotting assay. To investigate the relationship between the potential zinc-binding region and E4 34k function, a series of mutant genes containing single amino acid substitutions at each of the conserved cysteine and histidine residues in E4 34k were constructed. The mutant proteins were examined for the ability to complement the late protein synthetic defect of an E4 deletion mutant, to physically interact with the viral E1b 55-kDa protein (E1b 55k) and cellular p53 protein, to relocalize E1b 55k, and to destabilize the p53 protein. These analyses identified a subset of cysteine and histidine residues required for stimulation of late gene expression, physical interaction with E1b 55k, and p53 destabilization. These data suggest that a zinc-binding domain participates in the formation of the E4 34k-E1b 55k physical complex and that the complex is required in late gene expression and for p53 destabilization."
10544104,Adenovirus E4 34k and E4 11k inhibit double strand break repair and are physically associated with the cellular DNA-dependent protein kinase.,"The adenovirus oncoproteins E4 34k and E4 11k, the products of E4 open reading frames 6 and 3, respectively, individually prevent the formation of concatemers of the linear viral genome in infected cells. We show here that genome concatenation in E4 mutant-infected cells requires the cellular DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA PK) and that E4 34k inhibits V(D)J recombination, a normal cellular process that is also dependent on DNA PK. We further show that both E4 34k and E4 11k coimmunoprecipitate with DNA PK. These observations indicate that E4 products block formation of concatemers of the viral genome by inhibiting DNA PK-dependent double strand break repair and suggest that they act by forming a physical complex with DNA PK. DNA PK also participates in activation of p53 DNA-binding activity by DNA damage. By inhibiting DNA PK function, E4 products may block p53 activation in response to the products of viral DNA replication and thus provide a new mechanism to prevent apoptosis of infected cells."
9525610,Adenovirus preterminal protein binds to the CAD enzyme at active sites of viral DNA replication on the nuclear matrix.,"Adenovirus (Ad) replicative complexes form at discrete sites on the nuclear matrix (NM) via an interaction mediated by the precursor of the terminal protein (pTP). The identities of cellular proteins involved in these complexes have remained obscure. We present evidence that pTP binds to a multifunctional pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme found at replication domains on the NM. Far-Western blotting identified proteins of 150 and 240 kDa that had pTP binding activity. Amino acid sequencing of the 150-kDa band revealed sequence identity to carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I) and a high degree of homology to the related trifunctional enzyme known as CAD (for carbamyl phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase). Western blotting with an antibody directed against CAD detected a 240-kDa band that comigrated with that detected by pTP far-Western blotting. Binding experiments showed that a pTP-CAD complex was immunoprecipitable from cell extracts in which pTP was expressed by a vaccinia virus recombinant. Additionally, in vitro-translated epitope-tagged pTP and CAD were immunoprecipitable as a complex, indicating the occurrence of a protein-protein interaction. Confocal fluorescence microscopy of Ad-infected NM showed that pTP and CAD colocalized in nuclear foci. Both pTP and CAD were confirmed to colocalize with active sites of replication detected by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. These data support the concept that the pTP-CAD interaction may allow anchorage of Ad replication complexes in the proximity of required cellular factors and may help to segregate replicated and unreplicated viral DNA."
8553588,Human papillomavirus E7 oncoproteins bind a single form of cyclin E in a complex with cdk2 and p107.,"The E6 and E7 proteins of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) act coordinately to immortalize human keratinocytes. These viral oncoproteins function by binding and altering the activity of cellular proteins which regulate cell cycle progression. Among the proteins bound by E7 are the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, as well as the related p107 and p130 proteins. In addition, E7 binds cyclin A, which regulates transit through the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. In this study, we demonstrate that HPV 18 E7 also associates with cyclin E which controls the G1/S transition. E7/cyclin E complexes were immunoprecipitated from E7-expressing cells as well as from cell extracts using GST-E7 fusion proteins. E7 was found to complex with a single form of cyclin E, and the binding was mediated through p107. Both E7/cyclin E and E7/cyclin A complexes exhibit kinase activity through associated cdk2 proteins which can contribute to phosphorylation of p107. The association of E7 with proteins which regulate transit through the cell cycle may provide an additional mechanism by which infection with human papillomaviruses results in cellular hyperproliferation."
8146144,The zinc finger region of the adenovirus E1A transactivating domain complexes with the TATA box binding protein.,"The 289R E1A protein of adenovirus transactivates a variety of viral and cellular promoters through protein-protein interactions. In earlier studies, mutational analyses of the E1A transactivating domain identified residues that are critical for transactivation and implied that the zinc finger region of the transactivating domain binds a transcription factor. Also, the E1A activation domain was found to bind to the TATA box binding protein (TBP) in vitro. Here, we tested the significance of the E1A-TBP interaction for E1A transactivation by analyzing the effects of conservative substitutions at each of the 49 residues of the E1A activation domain. Seven of the substitutions significantly diminished TBP binding in vitro. All of these were in the zinc finger region and were defective for transactivation in vivo. The perfect correlation between reduced TBP binding and transactivation argues strongly that a direct interaction between the E1A activation domain and TBP is critical to the mechanism of E1A activation. This genetic analysis leads us to further suggest that another factor, which is limiting, is also necessary for E1A-mediated transactivation."
11562473,Proteins related to the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin protein ligases interact with the L domain of Rous sarcoma virus and are required for gag budding from cells.,"The late assembly (L) domain of retrovirus Gag, required in the final steps of budding for efficient exit from the host cell, is thought to mediate its function through interaction with unknown cellular factors. Here, we report the identification of the Nedd4-like family of E3 ubiquitin protein ligases as proteins that specifically interact with the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) L domain in vitro and in vivo. We screened a chicken embryo cDNA expression library by using a peptide derived from the RSV p2b sequence, isolating two unique partial cDNA clones. Neither clone interacted with a peptide containing mutations known to disrupt in vivo RSV L domain function or with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) L domain-derived peptides. The WW domain region of one of the clones, late domain-interacting protein 1 (LDI-1), but not the C2 domain, bound RSV Gag and inhibited RSV Gag budding from human 293 cells in a dominant-negative manner, functionally implicating LDI-1 in RSV particle budding from cells. RSV Gag can be coimmune precipitated from cell extracts with an antisera directed at an exogenously expressed hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged LDI-1 or endogenous Nedd4 proteins. These findings mechanistically link the cellular ubiquitination pathway to retrovirus budding."
10913622,The adenovirus-2 E1B-55K protein interacts with a mSin3A/histone deacetylase 1 complex.,"The adenovirus E1B-55K protein is a multifunctional phosphoprotein that regulates nuclear to cytoplasmic export of host cell and viral mRNAs during lytic viral growth. E1B-55K also blocks apoptosis by binding and functionally inactivating the human tumor suppressor protein p53. Here, we show that E1B-55K interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and the transcriptional corepressor protein mSin3A, both in the adenovirus-transformed 293 cell line and during a lytic adenovirus infection. Furthermore, we show that the central amino acids 156-261 in E1B-55K are necessary for efficient HDAC1 interaction. Importantly, the E1B-55K/mSin3A/HDAC1 complex is also enzymatically active, catalyzing deacetylation of a histone substrate peptide. Collectively, our results suggest that E1B-55K interaction with mSin3A/HDAC1 containing complexes may be significant for one or several of the multiple activities ascribed to this protein."
2556261,Complex formation of human papillomavirus E7 proteins with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product.,"The E7 proteins encoded by the human papillomaviruses (HPVs) associated with anogenital lesions share significant amino acid sequence homology. The E7 proteins of these different HPVs were assessed for their ability to form complexes with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (p105-RB). Similar to the E7 protein of HPV-16, the E7 proteins of HPV-18, HBV-6b and HPV-11 were found to associate with p105-RB in vitro. The E7 proteins of HPV types associated with a high risk of malignant progression (HPV-16 and HPV-18) formed complexes with p105-RB with equal affinities. The E7 proteins encoded by HPV types 6b and 11, which are associated with clinical lesions with a lower risk for progression, bound to p105-RB with lower affinities. The E7 protein of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1), which does not share structural similarity in the amino terminal region with the HPV E7 proteins, was unable to form a detectable complex with p105-RB. The amino acid sequences of the HPV-16 E7 protein involved in complex formation with p105-RB in vitro have been mapped. Only a portion of the sequences that are conserved between the HPV E7 proteins and AdE1A were necessary for association with p105-RB. Furthermore, the HPV-16 E7-p105-RB complex was detected in an HPV-16-transformed human keratinocyte cell line."
8349626,Adenovirus DNA polymerase is phosphorylated by a stably associated histone H1 kinase.,"Adenovirus DNA polymerase (AdPol) exists as a complex with the preterminal protein (pTP) and is essential for both initiation and elongation stages of viral DNA replication. Recent evidence from our laboratory indicates that AdPol is a phosphoprotein and that the major in vivo phosphorylation site, serine 67, occurs within the consensus substrate recognition sequence for cdc2 kinases. In this study, we found that a protein kinase which also exhibits histone H1 phosphorylation activity is stably associated with AdPol. AdPol forms a multimeric complex with this histone H1 kinase and pTP in HeLa cells infected with adenovirus or coinfected with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding AdPol and pTP. The associated protein kinase and the p34cdc2 kinase phosphorylate AdPol at the same sites which are utilized in vivo, suggesting that the p34cdc2 kinase or a related kinase may be involved in the in vivo phosphorylation of AdPol. Serine 67 is also one of the major in vitro phosphorylation sites, and the substitution of alanine for serine at this position abolishes DNA replication initiation activity of AdPol."
9407131,The bovine papillomavirus E6 protein binds to the LD motif repeats of paxillin and blocks its interaction with vinculin and the focal adhesion kinase.,"The bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E6 oncoprotein can transform fibroblasts and induce anchorage-independent growth and disassembly of the actin stress fibers. We have previously shown that the E6 protein interacts with the focal adhesion protein, paxillin, suggesting a direct role of E6 in the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. We have now mapped the E6 binding sites on paxillin to the LD motif repeats region, which has been implicated in mediating paxillin binding to two other focal adhesion proteins, vinculin and the focal adhesion kinase. The five LD motif repeats identified in paxillin do not contribute equally to its interaction with E6. The first LD repeat is most critical for paxillin binding to E6 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the binding of recombinant wild-type E6 protein to paxillin blocked the interaction of several cellular proteins with paxillin, including vinculin and the focal adhesion kinase. A mutant E6 protein (H105) which does not bind to paxillin had no effect on the binding of these cellular proteins to paxillin. These data suggest that E6 disruption of the actin stress fibers occurs through blocking the interaction of paxillin with its cellular effectors such as vinculin and the focal adhesion kinase."
8493578,Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein.,"The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells."
17293873,Structure of a VEGF-VEGF receptor complex determined by electron microscopy.,"Receptor tyrosine kinases are activated upon ligand-induced dimerization. Here we show that the monomeric extracellular domain of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) has a flexible structure. Binding of VEGF to membrane-distal immunoglobulin-like domains causes receptor dimerization and promotes further interaction between receptor monomers through the membrane-proximal immunoglobulin-like domain 7. By this mechanism, ligand-induced dimerization of VEGFR-2 can be communicated across the membrane, activating the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains."
11573093,Interaction of coxsackievirus B3 with the full length coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor.,"Group B coxsackieviruses (CVB) utilize the coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) to recognize host cells. CAR is a membrane protein with two Ig-like extracellular domains (D1 and D2), a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain. The three-dimensional structure of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in complex with full length human CAR and also with the D1D2 fragment of CAR were determined to approximately 22 A resolution using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Pairs of transmembrane domains of CAR associate with each other in a detergent cloud that mimics a cellular plasma membrane. This is the first view of a virus-receptor interaction at this resolution that includes the transmembrane and cytoplasmic portion of the receptor. CAR binds with the distal end of domain D1 in the canyon of CVB3, similar to how other receptor molecules bind to entero- and rhinoviruses. The previously described interface of CAR with the adenovirus knob protein utilizes a side surface of D1."
9653139,Basal and human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein-induced degradation of Myc proteins by the ubiquitin pathway.,"We have previously shown that the degradation of c-myc and N-myc in vitro is mediated by the ubiquitin system. However, the role of the system in targeting the myc proteins in vivo and the identity of the conjugating enzymes and possible ancillary proteins involved has remained obscure. Here we report that the degradation of the myc proteins in cells is inhibited by lactacystin and MG132, two inhibitors of the 20S proteasome. Inhibition is accompanied by accumulation of myc-ubiquitin conjugates. Dissection of the ancillary proteins involved revealed that the high-risk human papillomavirus oncoprotein E6-16 stimulates conjugation and subsequent degradation of the myc proteins in vitro. Expression of E6-16 in cells results in significant shortening of the t1/2 of the myc proteins with subsequent decrease in their cellular level. Analysis of the conjugating enzymes revealed that under basal conditions the proteins can be conjugated by two pairs of E2s and E3s-E2-14 kDa and E3alpha involved in the ""N-end rule"" pathway, and E2-F1 (UbcH7) and E3-Fos involved also in conjugation of c-Fos. In the presence of E6-16, a third pair, E2-F1 and E6-AP mediate conjugation of myc by means of a mechanism that appears to be similar to that involved in the targeting of p53, formation of a myc. E6.E6-AP targeting complex. It is possible that in certain cells E6-mediated targeting of myc prevents myc-induced apoptosis and thus ensures maintenance of viral infection."
8139685,Promoter targeting by adenovirus E1a through interaction with different cellular DNA-binding domains.,"A puzzling property of the transcriptional activators encoded by several animal viruses is their ability to function promiscuously. The adenovirus E1a protein, for example, stimulates transcription of adenoviral genes as well as a wide variety of other viral and cellular genes. We show that E1a can interact with several classes of cellular DNA-binding domains and thereby be recruited to diverse promoters. Our results explain how a single protein can regulate transcription of multiple genes that lack a common promoter element."
7565781,Subregions of the adenovirus E1A transactivation domain target multiple components of the TFIID complex.,"Transcriptional activation by the adenovirus E1A 289R protein requires direct contacts with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and also displays a critical requirement for TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (T.G. Boyer and A. J. Berk, Genes Dev. 7:1810-1823, 1993; J. V. Geisberg, W. S. Lee, A. J. Berk, and R. P. Ricciardi, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:2488-2492, 1994; W. S. Lee, C. C. Kao, G. O. Bryant, X. Liu, and A. J. Berk, Cell 67:365-376, 1991; and Q. Zhou, P. M. Lieberman, T. G. Boyer, and A. J. Berk, Genes Dev. 6:1964-1974, 1992). In this report, we demonstrate that the activation domain of E1A (CR3) specifically binds to two TAFs, human TAFII250 (hTAFII250) and Drosophila TAFII110 (dTAFII110). These interactions can take place both in vivo and in vitro and require the carboxy-terminal region of CR3; the zinc finger region of CR3, which binds TBP, is not needed to bind these TAFs. We mapped the E1A-binding sites on hTAFII250 to an internal region that contains a number of structural motifs, including an HMG box, a bromodomain, and direct repeats. This represents the first demonstration that hTAFII250 may serve as a target of a transcriptional activator. We also mapped the E1A binding on dTAFII110 to its C-terminal region. This is of significance since, by contrast, Sp1-mediated activation requires binding to the N-terminal domain of dTAFII110. Thus, distinct surfaces of dTAFII110 can serve as target sites for different activators. Our results indicate that E1A may activate transcription, in part, through direct contacts of the CR3 subdomains with selected components of the TFIID complex."
16278217,"Streptococcal protein FOG, a novel matrix adhesin interacting with collagen I in vivo.","Group G streptococcus (GGS) is a human pathogen of emerging clinical significance. It causes skin and soft tissue infections, occasionally resulting in life-threatening conditions such as sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. We recently identified FOG, a novel surface protein of GGS with fibrinogen binding and immune evasion properties. Here we investigated the role of FOG in streptococcal primary adhesion to host tissue. A FOG-expressing clinical isolate adhered more efficiently to human skin biopsies ex vivo and to the murine dermis in vivo than a FOG-deficient strain. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of skin specimens exhibited that this property was assigned to the ability of FOG to interact with collagen I, a major interstitial component of the dermis. Overlay experiments with human skin extracts and radiolabeled FOG followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analysis identified both the alpha1- and alpha2-chains of collagen I as targets for FOG. Transmission electron microscopy of the molecular complexes revealed thread-like FOG molecules binding via their NH2 termini to distinct sites on collagen I monomers and fibrils. The results demonstrate that FOG is important for GGS adhesion in vivo, implying a pathogenic role for this surface protein."
15507604,The l2 minor capsid protein of human papillomavirus type 16 interacts with a network of nuclear import receptors.,"The L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during viral infection: in the initial phase after virion disassembly and in the productive phase when, together with the L1 major capsid proteins, they assemble the replicated viral DNA into virions. In this study we investigated the interactions between the L2 protein of high-risk human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) and nuclear import receptors. We discovered that HPV16 L2 interacts directly with both Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3). Moreover, binding of Ran-GTP to either Kapbeta(2) or Kapbeta(3) inhibits its interaction with L2, suggesting that the Kapbeta/L2 complex is import competent. In addition, we found that L2 forms a complex with the Kapalpha(2)beta(1) heterodimer via interaction with the Kapalpha(2) adapter. In agreement with the binding data, nuclear import of L2 in digitonin-permeabilized cells could be mediated by either Kapalpha(2)beta(1) heterodimers, Kapbeta(2), or Kapbeta(3). Mapping studies revealed that HPV16 L2 contains two nuclear localization signals (NLSs), in the N terminus (nNLS) and C terminus (cNLS), that could mediate its nuclear import. Together the data suggest that HPV16 L2 interacts via its NLSs with a network of karyopherins and can enter the nucleus via several import pathways mediated by Kapalpha(2)beta(1) heterodimers, Kapbeta(2), and Kapbeta(3)."
9192623,"Binding of human virus oncoproteins to hDlg/SAP97, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein.","The 9ORF1 gene encodes an adenovirus E4 region oncoprotein that requires a C-terminal region for transforming activity. Screening a lambdagt11 cDNA expression library with a 9ORF1 protein probe yielded a novel cellular PDZ domain-containing protein, 9BP-1, which binds to wild-type, but not a transformation-defective, C-terminal, mutant 9ORF1 protein. The fact that PDZ domains complex with specific sequences at the free C-terminal end of some proteins led to the recognition that the 9ORF1 C-terminal region contained such a consensus-binding motif. This discovery prompted investigations into whether the 9ORF1 protein associates with additional cellular proteins having PDZ domains. It was found that the 9ORF1 protein interacts directly, in vitro and in vivo, with the PDZ domain-containing protein hDlg/SAP97 (DLG), which is a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein and which also binds the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein. Of interest, in forming complexes, the 9ORF1 protein preferentially associated with the second PDZ domain of DLG, similar to adenomatous polyposis coli protein. Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax and most oncogenic human papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins also possessed PDZ domain-binding motifs at their C termini and, significantly, human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax and human papillomavirus 18 E6 proteins bound DLG in vitro. Considering the requirement of the 9ORF1 C-terminal region in transformation, these findings suggest that interactions with the cellular factor DLG may contribute to the tumorigenic potentials of several different human virus oncoproteins."
16374509,Identification of preferred protein interactions by phage-display of the human Src homology-3 proteome.,"We have determined the human genome to contain 296 different Src homology-3 (SH3) domains and cloned them into a phage-display vector. This provided a powerful and unbiased system for simultaneous assaying of the complete human SH3 proteome for the strongest binding to target proteins of interest, without the limitations posed by short linear peptide ligands or confounding variables of more indirect methods for protein interaction screening. Studies involving three ligand proteins, human immunodeficiency virus-1 Nef, p21-activated kinase (PAK)2 and ADAM15, showed previously reported as well as novel SH3 partners with nanomolar affinities specific for them. This argues that SH3 domains may have a more dominant role in directing cellular protein interactions than has been assumed. Besides showing potentially important new SH3-directed interactions, these studies also led to the discovery of novel signalling proteins, such as the PAK2-binding adaptor protein POSH2 and the ADAM15-binding sorting nexin family member SNX30."
10938125,Human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein binds and inactivates growth-inhibitory insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3.,"The E7 protein encoded by human papillomavirus type 16 is one of the few viral genes that can immortalize primary human cells and thereby override cellular senescence. While it is generally assumed that this property of E7 depends on its interaction with regulators of the cell cycle, we show here that E7 targets insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), the product of a p53-inducible gene that is overexpressed in senescent cells. IGFBP-3 can suppress cell proliferation and induce apoptosis; we show here that IGFBP-3-mediated apoptosis is inhibited by E7, which binds to IGFBP-3 and triggers its proteolytic cleavage. Two transformation-deficient mutants of E7 failed to inactivate IGFBP-3, suggesting that inactivation of IGFBP-3 may contribute to cell transformation."
11095724,A PPxY motif within the VP40 protein of Ebola virus interacts physically and functionally with a ubiquitin ligase: implications for filovirus budding.,"VP40, the putative matrix protein of both Ebola and Marburg viruses, possesses a conserved proline-rich motif (PY motif) at its N terminus. We demonstrate that the VP40 protein can mediate its own release from mammalian cells, and that the PY motif is important for this self-exocytosis (budding) function. In addition, we used Western-ligand blotting to demonstrate that the PY motif of VP40 can mediate interactions with specific cellular proteins that have type I WW-domains, including the mammalian ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4. Single point mutations that disrupted the PY motif of VP40 abolished the PY/WW-domain interactions. Significantly, the full-length VP40 protein was shown to interact both physically and functionally with full-length Rsp5, a ubiquitin ligase of yeast and homolog of Nedd4. The VP40 protein was multiubiquitinated by Rsp5 in a PY-dependent manner in an in vitro ubiquitination assay. These data demonstrate that the VP40 protein of Ebola virus possesses a PY motif that is functionally similar to those described previously for Gag and M proteins of specific retroviruses and rhabdoviruses, respectively. Last, these studies imply that VP40 likely plays an important role in filovirus budding, and that budding of retroviruses, rhabdoviruses, and filoviruses may proceed via analogous mechanisms."
17310249,Structure and nuclear import function of the C-terminal domain of influenza virus polymerase PB2 subunit.,"The trimeric influenza virus polymerase, comprising subunits PA, PB1 and PB2, is responsible for transcription and replication of the segmented viral RNA genome. Using a novel library-based screening technique called expression of soluble proteins by random incremental truncation (ESPRIT), we identified an independently folded C-terminal domain from PB2 and determined its solution structure by NMR. Using green fluorescent protein fusions, we show that both the domain and the full-length PB2 subunit are efficiently imported into the nucleus dependent on a previously overlooked bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS). The crystal structure of the domain complexed with human importin alpha5 shows how the last 20 residues unfold to permit binding to the import factor. The domain contains three surface residues implicated in adaptation from avian to mammalian hosts. One of these tethers the NLS-containing peptide to the core of the domain in the unbound state."
18391209,Adenovirus serotype 5 hexon is critical for virus infection of hepatocytes in vivo.,"Human species C adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) is the most common viral vector used in clinical studies worldwide. Ad5 vectors infect liver cells in vivo with high efficiency via a poorly defined mechanism, which involves virus binding to vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation factors. Here, we report that the major Ad5 capsid protein, hexon, binds human coagulation factor X (FX) with an affinity of 229 pM. This affinity is 40-fold stronger than the reported affinity of Ad5 fiber for the cellular receptor coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, CAR. Cryoelectron microscopy and single-particle image reconstruction revealed that the FX attachment site is localized to the central depression at the top of the hexon trimer. Hexon-mutated virus bearing a large insertion in hexon showed markedly reduced FX binding in vitro and failed to deliver a transgene to hepatocytes in vivo. This study describes the mechanism of FX binding to Ad5 and demonstrates the critical role of hexon for virus infection of hepatocytes in vivo."
18725644,Structural basis for suppression of a host antiviral response by influenza A virus.,"Influenza A viruses are responsible for seasonal epidemics and high mortality pandemics. A major function of the viral NS1A protein, a virulence factor, is the inhibition of the production of IFN-beta mRNA and other antiviral mRNAs. The NS1A protein of the human influenza A/Udorn/72 (Ud) virus inhibits the production of these antiviral mRNAs by binding the cellular 30-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30), which is required for the 3' end processing of all cellular pre-mRNAs. Here we report the 1.95-A resolution X-ray crystal structure of the complex formed between the second and third zinc finger domain (F2F3) of CPSF30 and the C-terminal domain of the Ud NS1A protein. The complex is a tetramer, in which each of two F2F3 molecules wraps around two NS1A effector domains that interact with each other head-to-head. This structure identifies a CPSF30 binding pocket on NS1A comprised of amino acid residues that are highly conserved among human influenza A viruses. Single amino acid changes within this binding pocket eliminate CPSF30 binding, and a recombinant Ud virus expressing an NS1A protein with such a substitution is attenuated and does not inhibit IFN-beta pre-mRNA processing. This binding pocket is a potential target for antiviral drug development. The crystal structure also reveals that two amino acids outside of this pocket, F103 and M106, which are highly conserved (>99%) among influenza A viruses isolated from humans, participate in key hydrophobic interactions with F2F3 that stabilize the complex."
15554700,Characterization of Lck-binding elements in the herpesviral regulatory Tip protein.,"Herpesvirus saimiri encodes a tyrosine kinase interacting protein (Tip) that binds to T-cell-specific tyrosine kinase Lck via multiple sequence motifs and controls its activity. The regulation of Lck by Tip represents a key mechanism in the transformation of human T-lymphocytes during herpesviral infection. In this study, the interaction of Tip with the regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains of Lck was investigated by biophysical and computational techniques. NMR spectroscopy of isotopically labeled Tip(140-191) revealed that the interaction with the LckSH3 domain is not restricted to the classical proline-rich motif, but also involves the C-terminally adjacent residues which pack into a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the SH3 domain, thus playing a likely role in mediating binding specificity. Fluorescence binding studies of Tip further demonstrate that Tyr127 in its phosphorylated form represents a strong ligand of the LckSH2 domain, indicating the presence of an additional Lck interaction motif. In contrast, Tyr114, known to be essential for STAT-3 binding, does not interact with the LckSH2 domain, showing that the tyrosines in Tip exhibit distinct binding specificity. The existence of numerous interaction sites between Tip and the regulatory domains of Lck implies a complex regulatory mechanism and may have evolved to allow a gradual regulation of Lck activity in different pathogenic states."
9271389,"Luman, a new member of the CREB/ATF family, binds to herpes simplex virus VP16-associated host cellular factor.","The human host cell factor (HCF) is expressed in a variety of adult and fetal tissues, and its gene is conserved in animals as diverse as mammals and insects. However, its only known function is to stabilize the herpes simplex virus virion transactivator VP16 in a complex with the cellular POU domain protein Oct-1 and cis-acting regulatory elements in promoters of immediate-early viral genes. To identify a cellular function for HCF, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify a cellular ligand for HCF. This protein, Luman, appears to be a cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding protein/activating transcription factor 1 protein of the basic leucine zipper superfamily. It binds CREs in vitro and activates CRE-containing promoters when transfected into COS7 cells. This activation of transcription was synergistically enhanced by the presence of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein elements and inhibited by AP-1 elements in the promoter. In addition to a basic DNA binding domain, Luman possesses an unusually long leucine zipper and an acidic amino-terminal activation domain. These features in Luman are also present in what appear to be homologs in the mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. Luman and VP16 appear to have similar mechanisms for binding HCF, as in vitro each competitively inhibited the binding of the other to HCF. In transfected cells, however, while VP16 strongly inhibited the ability of GAL-Luman to activate transcription from a GAL4 upstream activation sequence-containing promoter, Luman was unable to inhibit the activity of GAL-VP16. Luman appears to be a ubiquitous transcription factor, and its mRNA was detected in all human adult and fetal tissues examined. The possible role of HCF in regulating the function of this ubiquitous transcription factor is discussed."
9973195,BNIP3alpha: a human homolog of mitochondrial proapoptotic protein BNIP3.,"Apoptosis is regulated by interaction of viral and cellular BCL-2 family antiapoptotic proteins with various pro-apoptotic proteins, several of which are also members of the BCL-2 family. Cellular protein BNIP3 is a BCL-2 family proapoptotic protein that interacts with viral antiapoptosis proteins such as adenoviruses E1B-19K and EBV-BHRF1 and cellular antiapoptosis proteins such as BCL-2 and BCL-xL. Database searches indicate that the human genome encodes an open reading frame for a protein, BNIP3alpha, that shares substantial homology with BNIP3. The BNIP3alpha open reading frame encodes a protein of 219 amino acids that contains a conserved BH3 domain and a COOH-terminal trans-membrane domain, characteristic of several BCL-2 family proapoptotic proteins. BNIP3alpha interacts with viral antiapoptosis protein E1B-19K and cellular antiapoptosis proteins BCL-2 and BCL-xL. Overexpression of BNIP3alpha in transfected cells results in apoptosis and suppresses the antiapoptosis activity of E1B-19K and BCL-xL. Like BNIP3, BNIP3alpha seems to be predominantly localized in mitochondria. These results suggest that BNIP3alpha is a structural and functional homologue of BNIP3. BNIP3 and BNIP3alpha seem to be the first examples of homologues among the various human proapoptotic proteins. Northern blot analysis reveals that BNIP3alpha is expressed ubiquitously in most human tissues. In contrast, BNIP3 is expressed well in several human tissues and less abundantly in certain tissues such as placenta and lung. These results suggest that although BNIP3 and BNIP3alpha may promote apoptosis simultaneously in most human tissues, BNIP3alpha may play a more universal role."
14576168,A mammalian homolog of Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional coactivator intersex is a subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex.,"The multiprotein Mediator complex is a coactivator required for transcriptional activation of RNA polymerase II transcribed genes by DNA binding transcription factors. We previously partially purified a Med8-containing Mediator complex from rat liver nuclei (Brower, C. S., Sato, S., Tomomori-Sato, C., Kamura, T., Pause, A., Stearman, R., Klausner, R. D., Malik, S., Lane, W. S., Sorokina, I., Roeder, R. G., Conaway, J. W., and Conaway, R. C. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 10353-10358). Analysis of proteins present in the most highly enriched Mediator fractions by tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of several new mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as several potential Mediator subunits. Here we identify one of these proteins, encoded by the previously uncharacterized AK000411 open reading frame, as a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. The AK000411 protein, which we designate hIntersex (human Intersex), shares significant sequence similarity with the Drosophila melanogaster intersex protein, which has functional properties expected of a transcriptional coactivator specific for the Drosophila doublesex transactivator. In addition, we show that hIntersex assembles into a subcomplex with Mediator subunits p28b and TRFP. Taken together, our findings identify a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator and shed new light on the architecture of the mammalian Mediator complex."
14638676,A mammalian mediator subunit that shares properties with Saccharomyces cerevisiae mediator subunit Cse2.,"The multiprotein Mediator complex is a coactivator required for activation of RNA polymerase II transcription by DNA bound transcription factors. We previously identified and partially purified a mammalian Mediator complex from rat liver nuclei (Brower, C.S., Sato, S., Tomomori-Sato, C., Kamura, T., Pause, A., Stearman, R., Klausner, R.D., Malik, S., Lane, W.S., Sorokina, I., Roeder, R.G., Conaway, J.W., and Conaway, R.C. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 10353-10358). Analysis by tandem mass spectrometry of proteins present in the most highly purified rat Mediator fractions led to the identification of a collection of new mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as several potential Mediator subunits including a previously uncharacterized protein encoded by the FLJ10193 open reading frame. In this study, we present direct biochemical evidence that the FLJ10193 protein, which we designate Med25, is a bona fide subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. In addition, we present evidence that Med25 shares structural and functional properties with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mediator subunit Cse2 and may be a mammalian Cse2 ortholog. Taken together, our findings identify a novel mammalian Mediator subunit and shed new light on the architecture of the mammalian Mediator complex."
11714716,"Gemin5, a novel WD repeat protein component of the SMN complex that binds Sm proteins.","The survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein is the product of the disease gene of spinal muscular atrophy and is found both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it is concentrated in gems. SMN is part of a multi-protein complex that includes Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4. The SMN complex plays an important role in the cytoplasmic assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and likely other RNPs in pre-mRNA splicing and in the assembly of transcriptosomes. Here, we report the identification of an additional component of the SMN complex, a novel WD repeat protein termed Gemin5. Gemin5 binds SMN directly and is a component of the SMN complex. Furthermore, Gemin5 interacts with several of the snRNP core proteins including SmB, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, and SmE, suggesting that it participates in the activities of the SMN complex in snRNP assembly. Immunolocalization studies demonstrate that Gemin5 is found in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, where it colocalizes with SMN in gems. The presence of 13 WD repeat domains in the amino-terminal half of Gemin5 and a coiled-coil motif near its carboxyl terminus indicate that it may form a large heteromeric complex and engage in multiple interactions."
8207801,Inhibition of p53 DNA binding by human papillomavirus E6 proteins.,"Transformation by the human papillomavirus (HPV) early gene products, E6 and E7, involves their interaction with cellular proteins p53 and Rb. Using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, we found that HPV E6 bound human p53 and that the relative efficiency of binding varied such that the GST-HPV type 16 E6 (16E6) protein bound p53 with highest affinity, followed by GST-31E6, GST-18E6, and GST-11E6. The GST-E6 fusion proteins were sufficient for binding p53 purified from a baculovirus expression system as well as in vitro translation sources, while no association was observed with GST-18E7 or a GST-16E6 mutant bearing a five-amino-acid deletion in E6. When the site-specific DNA binding activity of p53 was examined in the presence of GST-E6 proteins, an inhibition of DNA binding was observed. The degree of inhibition correlated with the relative affinity of different E6 proteins for p53; thus, GST-16E6 was the most potent inhibitor of p53 DNA binding activity, and GST-11E6 was the least effective. Prevention of p53 DNA binding is likely to play a role in the abrogation of the transcriptional activity of p53 by HPV E6 and provides a further mechanism for E6 disruption of p53 growth suppressor function in addition to its role in directing specific degradation of p53 through the ubiquitin-mediated pathway. The variation in inhibition of DNA binding seen with the various E6 proteins may thus contribute to the differences in oncogenic potential seen among the HPV types."
2157286,Association of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 E6 proteins with p53.,"Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is a DNA tumor virus that is associated with human anogenital cancers and encodes two transforming proteins, E6 and E7. The E7 protein has been shown to bind to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product, pRB. This study shows that the E6 protein of HPV-16 is capable of binding to the cellular p53 protein. The ability of the E6 proteins from different human papillomaviruses to form complexes with p53 was assayed and found to correlate with the in vivo clinical behavior and the in vitro transforming activity of these different papillomaviruses. The wild-type p53 protein has tumor suppressor properties and has also been found in association with large T antigen and the E1B 55-kilodalton protein in cells transformed by SV40 and by adenovirus type 5, respectively, providing further evidence that the human papillomaviruses, the adenoviruses, and SV40 may effect similar cellular pathways in transformation."
9169421,Identification of novel human WW domain-containing proteins by cloning of ligand targets.,"A recently described protein module consisting of 35-40 semiconserved residues, termed the WW domain, has been identified in a number of diverse proteins including dystrophin and Yes-associated protein (YAP). Two putative ligands of YAP, termed WBP-1 and WBP-2, have been found previously to contain several short peptide regions consisting of PPPPY residues (PY motif) that mediate binding to the WW domain of YAP. Although the function(s) of the WW domain remain to be elucidated, these observations strongly support a role for the WW domain in protein-protein interactions. Here we report the isolation of three novel human cDNAs encoding a total of nine WW domains, using a newly developed approach termed COLT (cloning of ligand targets), in which the rapid cloning of modular protein domains is accomplished by screening cDNA expression libraries with specific peptide ligands. Two of the new genes identified appear to be members of a family of proteins, including Rsp5 and Nedd-4, which have ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. In addition, we demonstrate that peptides corresponding to PY and PY-like motifs present in several known signaling or regulatory proteins, including RasGAP, AP-2, p53BP-2 (p53-binding protein-2), interleukin-6 receptor-alpha, chloride channel CLCN5, and epithelial sodium channel ENaC, can selectively bind to certain of these novel WW domains."
11907332,Complementation of a p300/CBP defective-binding mutant of adenovirus E1a by human papillomavirus E6 proteins.,"Previous studies have shown that the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E6 protein binds to p300/CBP and abrogates its transcriptional co-activator function. However, there is little information on the biological consequences of this interaction and discrepancy as to whether the interaction is high-risk E6 specific or not. We performed a series of studies to compare the interactions of HPV-18 and HPV-11 E6 with p300, and showed that both high- and low- risk E6 proteins bind p300. In addition, using a transformation-deficient mutant of adenovirus E1a, which cannot interact with p300, we demonstrated that HPV-16, HPV-18 and, to a lesser extent, HPV-11 E6, can complement this mutant in cell transformation assays. In contrast, a mutant of HPV-16 E6 which does not bind p300 failed to rescue the E1a mutant. These results suggest that the E6-p300 interaction may be important for the ability of HPV E6 to contribute towards cell transformation."
11571640,HPV E6 and MAGUK protein interactions: determination of the molecular basis for specific protein recognition and degradation.,"It has recently been shown that the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 proteins can target the PDZ-domain containing proteins, Dlg, MUPP-1, MAGI-1 and hScrib for proteasome-mediated degradation. However, the E6 proteins from HPV-16 and HPV-18 (the two most common high-risk virus types) differ in their ability to target these proteins in a manner that correlates with their malignant potential. To investigate the underlying mechanisms for this, we have mutated HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6s to give each protein the other's PDZ-binding motif. Analysis of these mutants shows that the greater ability of HPV-18 E6 to bind to these proteins and to target them for degradation is indeed due to a single amino acid difference. Using a number of assays, we show that the E6 proteins interact specifically with only one of the five PDZ domains of MAGI-1, and this is the first interaction described for this particular PDZ domain. We also show that the guanylate kinase homology domain and the regions of MAGI-1 downstream of amino acid 733 are not required for the degradation of MAGI-1. Finally, in a series of comparative analyses, we show that the degradation of MAGI-1 occurs through a different mechanism from that used by the E6 protein to induce the degradation of Dlg and p53."
11807220,Mutational analysis of the discs large tumour suppressor identifies domains responsible for human papillomavirus type 18 E6-mediated degradation.,"The discs large (Dlg) tumour suppressor protein is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the high-risk human papillomavirus E6 proteins. To understand further the mechanisms behind this, a mutational analysis of Dlg was undertaken. This study demonstrates that an intact PDZ domain 2 (PDZ2) on Dlg is necessary for the ability of E6 to bind and degrade Dlg. However, additional residues within the amino-terminal portion of Dlg are also required for optimal E6 activity. Stable cell lines expressing different Dlg mutants were also established and these confirm that Dlg is regulated intrinsically by the proteasome in the absence of E6; however, in this case, the sequences responsible for regulating Dlg stability lie predominantly within PDZ2. These results suggest that there are at least two mechanisms for regulating Dlg protein stability and that the pathways used by E6 are not necessarily the same as those used in the cell in its absence."
10523825,Oncogenic human papillomavirus E6 proteins target the discs large tumour suppressor for proteasome-mediated degradation.,"Previous studies have shown that the oncogenic HPV E6 proteins form a complex with the human homologue of the Drosophila tumour suppressor protein, discs large (Dlg). This is mediated by the carboxy terminus of the E6 proteins and involves recognition of at least one PDZ domain of Dlg. This region of E6 is not conserved amongst E6 proteins from the low risk papillomavirus types and, hence, binding of HPV E6 proteins to Dlg correlates with the oncogenic potential of these viruses. We have performed studies to investigate the consequences of the interaction between E6 and Dlg. Mutational analysis of both the HPV18 E6 and Dlg proteins has further defined the regions of E6 and Dlg necessary for complex formation. Strikingly, co-expression of wild type HPV18 E6 with Dlg in vitro or in vivo results in a dramatic decrease in the amount of Dlg protein, whereas mutants of E6 which fail to complex with Dlg have minimal effect on Dlg protein levels. The oncogenic HPV16 E6 also decreased the Dlg levels, but this was not observed with the low risk HPV11 E6 protein. Moreover, a region within the first 544 amino acids of Dlg containing the three PDZ domains confers susceptibility to E6 mediated degradation. Finally, treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor overrides the capacity of E6 to degrade Dlg. These results demonstrate that Dlg is targeted by high risk HPV E6 proteins for proteasome mediated degradation."
2537532,The human papilloma virus-16 E7 oncoprotein is able to bind to the retinoblastoma gene product.,"Deletions or mutations of the retinoblastoma gene, RB1, are common features of many tumors and tumor cell lines. Recently, the RB1 gene product, p105-RB, has been shown to form stable protein/protein complexes with the oncoproteins of two DNA tumor viruses, the adenovirus E1A proteins and the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen. Neither of these viruses is thought to be associated with human cancer, but they can cause tumors in rodents. Binding between the RB anti-oncoprotein and the adenovirus or SV40 oncoprotein can be recapitulated in vitro with coimmunoprecipitation mixing assays. These assays have been used to demonstrate that the E7 oncoprotein of the human papilloma virus type-16 can form similar complexes with p105-RB. Human papilloma virus-16 is found associated with approximately 50 percent of cervical carcinomas. These results suggest that these three DNA viruses may utilize similar mechanisms in transformation and implicate RB binding as a possible step in human papilloma virus-associated carcinogenesis."
16103886,The hScrib/Dlg apico-basal control complex is differentially targeted by HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 proteins.,"The E6 proteins of the high-risk Human papillomaviruses (HPV) types have a well-documented ability to target certain cellular proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation via the proteasome. Previous studies have shown that E6 proteins interact differently with different target proteins, and that the viral proteins, depending upon the target, may recruit diverse cellular ubiquitin-protein ligases. In this study, we have examined the abilities of E6 proteins from HPV-16 and HPV-18 to interact with and induce the degradation of two PDZ domain-containing targets, Dlg and hScrib. We have also mapped the binding site of E6 on hScrib and shown that the interaction of E6 with hScrib is distinct from its interactions with other PDZ domain-containing targets. This is reflected in the efficiency with which the two viral E6 proteins can inhibit hScrib's suppression of cell transformation.Dlg and hScrib have complementary activities in the control of epithelial cell polarity and the fact that both are targeted by high-risk HPV E6 proteins underlines their importance. Our finding that they are each targeted differently by HPV-16 and HPV-18 E 6 s suggests that the two viruses are subjected to somewhat different constraints and provides a possible explanation for the apparent redundancy in targeting both parts of this important control mechanism."
12620808,The L1 major capsid protein of human papillomavirus type 11 interacts with Kap beta2 and Kap beta3 nuclear import receptors.,"We have previously shown that the L1 major capsid protein of low-risk HPV11 binds to the Kap alpha2 adapter and enters the nucleus via a Kap alpha2beta1-mediated pathway. In this study, we discovered that HPV11 L1 capsomeres bind to Kap beta2 import receptor, known to mediate nuclear import of hnRNP A1 via interaction with its nuclear localization signal termed M9. Significantly, binding of HPV11 L1 capsomeres to Kap beta2 inhibited the nuclear import of Kap beta2, and its specific M9-containing cargo. Interestingly, HPV11 L1 capsomeres also interacted with Kap beta3 import receptor and inhibited Kap beta3 nuclear import. Moreover, the L1 capsomeres of high-risk HPV-16 shared these activities. These data suggest that HPV L1 major capsid proteins interact with Kap beta2 and Kap beta3, and they may inhibit the Kap beta2- and Kap beta3-mediated nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral life cycle when the virions are assembled and released."
18358807,PILRalpha is a herpes simplex virus-1 entry coreceptor that associates with glycoprotein B.,"Glycoprotein B (gB) is one of the essential components for infection by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). Although several cellular receptors that associate with glycoprotein D (gD), such as herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) and Nectin-1, have been identified, specific molecules that mediate HSV-1 infection by associating with gB have not been elucidated. Here, we found that paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor (PILR) alpha associates with gB, and cells transduced with PILRalpha become susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Furthermore, HSV-1 infection of human primary cells expressing both HVEM and PILRalpha was blocked by either anti-PILRalpha or anti-HVEM antibody. Our results demonstrate that cellular receptors for both gB and gD are required for HSV-1 infection and that PILRalpha plays an important role in HSV-1 infection as a coreceptor that associates with gB. These findings uncover a crucial aspect of the mechanism underlying HSV-1 infection."
18068675,A conserved domain of herpes simplex virus ICP34.5 regulates protein phosphatase complex in mammalian cells.,"ICP34.5, encoded by herpes simplex virus 1, is a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunit that mediates dephosphorylation of the alpha subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). However, the mechanism of its action remains poorly understood. Here, we show that amino acid substitutions in the arginine-rich motif have differential effects on ICP34.5 activity. The phenotypes parallel with viral protein synthesis and cytopathic effects in virus infected cells. Besides the consensus PP1 binding motif, the Arg-motif appears to enhance the interaction between ICP34.5 and PP1. These results suggest that concerted action between the PP1 binding domain and the effector domain of ICP34.5 is crucial for eIF2alpha dephosphorylation and viral protein synthesis."
15491611,Conserved residues in the HIV-1 Nef hydrophobic pocket are essential for recruitment and activation of the Hck tyrosine kinase.,"The Nef protein of the primate lentiviruses human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is essential for high-titer viral replication and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. Nef binds to the macrophage-specific Src family member Hck through its SH3 domain, resulting in constitutive kinase activation capable of transforming rodent fibroblasts. Nef-Hck interaction may be essential for M-tropic HIV replication and AIDS pathogenesis, identifying this virus-host protein complex as a rational target for anti-HIV drug discovery. Here, we investigated whether interaction with Hck is a common feature of Nef alleles from different strains of HIV-1. We compared the ability of four different laboratory HIV-1 Nef alleles (SF2, LAI, ELI, and Consensus) to induce Hck activation and transformation in our Rat-2 fibroblast model. While SF2, LAI, and Consensus Nef all bound and activated Hck, ELI Nef failed to bind to the Hck SH3 domain in vitro and did not cooperate with Hck in fibroblast transformation. Molecular modeling identified three residues in the core region of SF2 Nef (Ala83, His116, and Tyr120) which are substituted in ELI with Glu, Asn, and Ile, respectively. Two of these residues (Ala83 and Tyr120) form part of the hydrophobic pocket that contacts Ile 96 in the RT loop of the Hck SH3 domain in the Nef-SH3 crystal structure. Substitution of SF2 Nef Tyr120 with Ile completely abolished Hck recruitment and activation. In a complementary experiment, substitution of ELI Ile120 with Tyr partly restored ELI Nef-induced Hck activation and transformation in Rat-2 cells. Hck activation increased further by substitution of ELI Glu83 with Ala and Asn116 with His, suggestive of a supportive role for these residues in Hck binding. This study provides the first biological evidence that the HIV-1 Nef hydrophobic pocket is critical to Hck recruitment and activation in vivo. Targeting the Nef hydrophobic pocket with a small molecule may be sufficient to disrupt Nef signaling through Hck in HIV-infected macrophages, slowing disease progression."
18977328,Inactivation of the CYLD deubiquitinase by HPV E6 mediates hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB activation.,"The biochemical mechanisms that underlie hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB activity have remained largely undefined. Here, we find that prolonged hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB activation is restricted to cancer cell lines infected with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) serotypes. The HPV-encoded E6 protein is necessary and sufficient for prolonged hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB activation in these systems. The molecular target of E6 in the NF-kappaB pathway is the CYLD lysine 63 (K63) deubiquitinase, a negative regulator of the NF-kappaB pathway. Specifically, hypoxia stimulates E6-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CYLD. Given the established role of NF-kappaB in human carcinogenesis, these findings provide a potential molecular/viral link between hypoxia and the adverse clinical outcomes observed in HPV-associated malignancies."
15367624,Ring finger protein ZIN interacts with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vif.,"Virion infectivity factor (Vif) protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is essential for the productive infection of primary human CD4 T lymphocytes and macrophages. Vif overcomes the HIV-inhibitory effects of cellular factor APOBEC3G, which has cytidine deaminase activity. We previously reported the isolation of a Vif-interacting ring finger protein, Triad 3, from a human leukocyte cDNA library, using the yeast two-hybrid system. The full-length cellular protein homologue of Triad 3 has been recently identified as the zinc finger protein inhibiting NF-kappaB (ZIN). Sequence analysis indicates that Triad 3 protein contains all four major ring-like motifs of ZIN. We report here that ZIN binds to purified Vif in vitro and that Triad 3/ZIN interacts with HIV-1 Vif in transfected human 293T cells, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation. To test the biological relevance of this interaction, we produced infectious HIV-1 NL4.3 in the presence or absence of cotransfected ZIN. HIV-1 NL4.3 virus stocks produced in the presence of exogenously expressed ZIN were twofold less infectious in a single-cycle infectivity assay than virus produced in the absence of exogenous ZIN. It was further shown that cells infected with HIV NL4.3 virus stocks produced in the presence of exogenously expressed ZIN were impaired in viral DNA synthesis by twofold. The impairment in viral reverse transcription and the reduction in single-cycle viral infectivity were both shown to be dependent on the presence of Vif in the virus producer cells. The possible mechanisms by which ZIN interferes with the early events of HIV-1 replication are discussed."
15452250,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 Gag interacts specifically with PRP4, a serine-threonine kinase, and inhibits phosphorylation of splicing factor SF2.","Using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a T-cell cDNA library to identify cellular proteins that bind to the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) Gag polyprotein, we identified PRP4, a serine-threonine protein kinase. Specific interaction of PRP4 and HIV-2 Gag was confirmed in in vitro and in vivo assays. The interacting region of HIV-2 Gag is located in the conserved matrix and capsid domains, while both the RS (arginine-serine-rich) domain and the KS (kinase) domain of PRP4 are able to bind to HIV-2 Gag. PRP4 is not incorporated into virus particles. HIV-2 Gag is able to inhibit PRP4-mediated phosphorylation of the splicing factor SF2. This is also observed with Gag from simian immunodeficiency virus, a closely related virus, but not with Gag from human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. Our results provide evidence for a novel interaction between Gag and a cellular protein kinase involved in the control of constitutive splicing in two closely related retroviruses. We hypothesize that as Gag accumulates in the cell, down regulation of splicing occurs through reduced phosphorylation of SF2. At late stages of infection, this interaction may replace the function of the early viral regulatory protein Rev."
12859895,Species-specific exclusion of APOBEC3G from HIV-1 virions by Vif.,"The HIV-1 accessory protein Vif (virion infectivity factor) is required for the production of infectious virions by CD4(+) lymphocytes. Vif facilitates particle infectivity by blocking the inhibitory activity of APOBEC3G (CEM15), a virion-encapsidated cellular protein that deaminates minus-strand reverse transcript cytosines to uracils. We report that HIV-1 Vif forms a complex with human APOBEC3G that prevents its virion encapsidation. HIV-1 Vif did not efficiently form a complex with mouse APOBEC3G. Vif dramatically reduced the amount of human APOBEC3G encapsidated in HIV-1 virions but did not prevent encapsidation of mouse or AGM APOBEC3G. As a result, these enzymes are potent inhibitors of wild-type HIV-1 replication. The species-specificity of this interaction may play a role in restricting HIV-1 infection to humans. Together these findings suggest that therapeutic intervention that either induced APOBEC3G or blocked its interaction with Vif could be clinically beneficial."
16601680,Requirement for SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex in Tat-mediated activation of the HIV-1 promoter.,"Activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) promoter in infected cells requires the sequential recruitment of several cellular factors to facilitate the formation of a processive elongation complex. The nucleosomal reorganization of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) observed upon Tat stimulation suggests that chromatin-remodeling complexes could play a role during this process. Here, we reported that Tat interacts directly with Brm, a DNA-dependent ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, to activate the HIV-1 LTR. Inhibition of Brm via small interfering RNAs impaired Tat-mediated transactivation of an integrated HIV-1 promoter. Furthermore, Brm is recruited in vivo to the HIV-1 LTR in a Tat-dependent manner. Interestingly, we found that Tat/Brm interaction is regulated by Tat lysine 50 acetylation. These data show the requirement of Tat-mediated recruitment of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex to HIV-1 promoter in the activation of the LTR."
17254575,Gelsolin segment 5 inhibits HIV-induced T-cell apoptosis via Vpr-binding to VDAC.,"Viral protein R (Vpr) from the human immunodeficiency virus induces cell cycle arrest in proliferating cells, stimulates virus transcription, and regulates activation and apoptosis of infected T-lymphocytes. We report that Jurkat cells overexpressing full-length gelsolin show resistance to Vpr-induced T-cell apoptosis with abrogation of mitochondrial membrane potential loss and the release of cytochrome c. Co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells demonstrated that overexpression of full-length or segment 5 (G5) but not G5-deleted gelsolin (DeltaG5) bound to the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and that the G5 subunit can inhibit HIV-1-Vpr-binding to VDAC. We also confirmed that full-length gelsolin has the same effect in Jurkat cells. Clonogenic analysis showed that transfection of G5 but not DeltaG5 cDNA protects Jurkat T cells from HIV-Vpr-Tet induced T-cell apoptosis and promoted cell survival, as did full-length gelsolin. These results suggest that the gelsolin G5 domain inhibits HIV-Vpr-induced T-cell apoptosis by blocking the interaction between Vpr and VDAC, and might be used as a protective treatment against HIV-Vpr-induced T-cell apoptosis."
17076584,Human immunodeficiency virus impairs reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages.,"Several steps of HIV-1 replication critically depend on cholesterol. HIV infection is associated with profound changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Whereas numerous studies have investigated the role of anti-HIV drugs in lipodystrophy and dyslipidemia, the effects of HIV infection on cellular cholesterol metabolism remain uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that HIV-1 impairs ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-dependent cholesterol efflux from human macrophages, a condition previously shown to be highly atherogenic. In HIV-1-infected cells, this effect was mediated by Nef. Transfection of murine macrophages with Nef impaired cholesterol efflux from these cells. At least two mechanisms were found to be responsible for this phenomenon: first, HIV infection and transfection with Nef induced post-transcriptional down-regulation of ABCA1; and second, Nef caused redistribution of ABCA1 to the plasma membrane and inhibited internalization of apolipoprotein A-I. Binding of Nef to ABCA1 was required for down-regulation and redistribution of ABCA1. HIV-infected and Nef-transfected macrophages accumulated substantial amounts of lipids, thus resembling foam cells. The contribution of HIV-infected macrophages to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis was supported by the presence of HIV-positive foam cells in atherosclerotic plaques of HIV-infected patients. Stimulation of cholesterol efflux from macrophages significantly reduced infectivity of the virions produced by these cells, and this effect correlated with a decreased amount of virion-associated cholesterol, suggesting that impairment of cholesterol efflux is essential to ensure proper cholesterol content in nascent HIV particles. These results reveal a previously unrecognized dysregulation of intracellular lipid metabolism in HIV-infected macrophages and identify Nef and ABCA1 as the key players responsible for this effect. Our findings have implications for pathogenesis of both HIV disease and atherosclerosis, because they reveal the role of cholesterol efflux impairment in HIV infectivity and suggest a possible mechanism by which HIV infection of macrophages may contribute to increased risk of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients."
12600646,The role of Vif during HIV-1 infection: interaction with novel host cellular factors.,"Current research suggests that human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) virion infectivity factor (Vif) acts during viral assembly in producer cells to ensure infectivity in target cells but the exact mechanism of action has not been defined. Vif interacts with Gag, viral protease and RNA and these interactions are proposed to be important for correct particle assembly and stability of the reverse transcription complex."
16094715,Screening of genes of proteins interacting with p7 protein of hepatitis C virus from human liver cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid system.,To investigate the biological function of p7 protein and to look for proteins interacting with p7 protein in hepatocytes.
8607265,Identification of a cellular protein that specifically interacts with the essential cysteine region of the HIV-1 Tat transactivator.,"The Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a powerful activator of HIV gene expression. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that one or more cellular cofactors may be important for Tat activity. We have used two-hybrid interactive cloning in yeast to identify a partial cDNA clone (clone 10) from a human B-lymphoblastoid library that specifically interacts with the N-terminal 31 amino acids of HIV-1 Tat which contains the essential cysteine-rich portion of the Tat activation domain. The encoded protein also binds to purified Tat in vitro. Mutation of single essential cysteine residues in Tat abolishes interaction between Tat and clone 10, suggesting that interaction with the encoded protein is important for Tat activity. We have identified the full-length cDNA for the Tat binding protein and shown that overexpression of the encoded protein, Tip60 (Tat interactive protein, 60 kDa), results in a fourfold augmentation of Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter in transient expression assays without increasing the basal activity of the HIV promoter or activating the heterologous RSV promoter. These data together with the genetic and in vitro binding data support the notion that Tip60 might be a cofactor of Tat involved in the regulation of HIV gene expression."
12055184,"Physical and functional interaction of HIV-1 Tat with E2F-4, a transcriptional regulator of mammalian cell cycle.","Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) plays a critical role in the regulation of viral transcription and replication. In addition, Tat regulates the expression of a variety of cellular genes and could account for AIDS-associated diseases including Kaposi's Sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by interfering with cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic activities of Tat may include the generation of functional heterodimers of Tat with cellular proteins. By screening a human B-lymphoblastoid cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified E2F-4, a member of E2F family of transcription factors, as a Tat-binding protein. The interaction between Tat and E2F-4 was confirmed by GST pull-down experiments performed with cellular extracts as well as with in vitro translated E2F-4. The physical association of Tat and E2F-4 was confirmed by in vivo binding experiments where Tat.E2F-4 heterodimers were recovered from Jurkat cells by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. By using plasmids expressing mutant forms of Tat and E2F-4, the domains involved in Tat.E2F-4 interaction were identified as the regions encompassing amino acids 1-49 of Tat and amino acids 1-184 of E2F-4. Tat x E2F-4 complexes were shown to bind to E2F cis-regions with increased efficiency compared with E2F-4 alone and to mediate the activity of E2F-dependent promoters including HIV-1 long terminal repeat and cyclin A. The data point to Tat as an adaptor protein that recruits cellular factors such as E2F-4 to exert its multiple biological activities."
10887206,Functional interaction between the HIV transactivator Tat and the transcriptional coactivator PC4 in T cells.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transactivator Tat is a potent activator of transcription from the HIV long terminal repeat and is essential for efficient viral gene expression and replication. Tat has been shown to interact with components of the basal transcription machinery and transcriptional activators. Here we identify the cellular coactivator PC4 as a Tat-interacting protein using the yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed this interaction both in vitro and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation. We found that this interaction has a functional outcome in that PC4 overexpression enhanced activation of the HIV long terminal repeat in transient transfection studies in a Tat-dependent manner. The domains of PC4 and Tat required for the interaction were mapped. In vitro binding studies showed that the basic transactivation-responsive binding domain of Tat is required for the interaction with PC4. The minimum region of PC4 required for Tat binding was amino acids 22-91, whereas mutation of the lysine-rich domain between amino acids 22 and 43 prevented interaction with Tat. Tat-PC4 interactions may be controlled by phosphorylation, because phosphorylation of PC4 by casein kinase II inhibited interactions with Tat both in vivo and in vitro. We propose that PC4 may be involved in linking Tat to the basal transcription machinery."
7982906,"Physical interaction of the HIV-1 Nef protein with beta-COP, a component of non-clathrin-coated vesicles essential for membrane traffic.","Nef is a 27-kDa myristylated protein conserved in most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates. Simian immunodeficiency virus Nef is required in macaques for both high viral load and full pathological effects. Nef down-regulates the cell surface expression of CD4 by a post-translational mechanism that is not yet fully elucidated. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify cellular proteins that interact with Nef. A cDNA was isolated which encodes a COOH-terminal fragment of human beta-COP, a major coat component of non-clathrin-coated vesicles. Nef and beta-COP interacted in vitro and were found to be physically associated in HIV-1-infected cells by co-immunoprecipitation. These observations suggest that beta-COP might be one of the cellular mediators of Nef function in HIV-1-infected cells."
18042718,Protein protein interaction inhibition (2P2I) combining high throughput and virtual screening: Application to the HIV-1 Nef protein.,"Protein-protein recognition is the cornerstone of multiple cellular and pathological functions. Therefore, protein-protein interaction inhibition (2P2I) is endowed with great therapeutic potential despite the initial belief that 2P2I was refractory to small-molecule intervention. Improved knowledge of complex molecular binding surfaces has recently stimulated renewed interest for 2P2I, especially after identification of ""hot spots"" and first inhibitory compounds. However, the combination of target complexity and lack of starting compound has thwarted experimental results and created intellectual barriers. Here we combined virtual and experimental screening when no previously known inhibitors can be used as starting point in a structure-based research program that targets an SH3 binding surface of the HIV type I Nef protein. High-throughput docking and application of a pharmacophoric filter on one hand and search for analogy on the other hand identified drug-like compounds that were further confirmed to bind Nef in the micromolar range (isothermal titration calorimetry), to target the Nef SH3 binding surface (NMR experiments), and to efficiently compete for Nef-SH3 interactions (cell-based assay, GST pull-down). Initial identification of these compounds by virtual screening was validated by screening of the very same library of compounds in the cell-based assay, demonstrating that a significant enrichment factor was attained by the in silico screening. To our knowledge, our results identify the first set of drug-like compounds that functionally target the HIV-1 Nef SH3 binding surface and provide the basis for a powerful discovery process that should help to speed up 2P2I strategies and open avenues for new class of antiviral molecules."
15068796,C. elegans SGK-1 is the critical component in the Akt/PKB kinase complex to control stress response and life span.,"The DAF-2 insulin receptor-like signaling pathway controls metabolism, development, longevity, and stress response in C. elegans. Here we show that SGK-1, the C. elegans homolog of the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK, acts in parallel to the AKT kinases to mediate DAF-2 signaling. Loss of sgk-1 results in defective egg-laying, extended generation time, increased stress resistance, and an extension of life span. SGK-1 forms a protein complex with the AKT kinases, and is activated by and strictly depends on PDK-1. All three kinases of this complex are able to directly phosphorylate DAF-16/FKHRL1, yet have different functions in DAF-2 signaling. Whereas AKT-1 and AKT-2 are more important for regulating dauer formation, SGK-1 is the crucial factor for the control of development, stress response, and longevity. Our data also suggest the existence of a second pathway from DAF-2 to DAF-16 that does not depend on AKT-1, AKT-2, and SGK-1."
11909874,HIV Tat binds Egr proteins and enhances Egr-dependent transactivation of the Fas ligand promoter.,"HIV Tat can enhance activation-induced up-regulation of Fas ligand (FasL), which may contribute to T cell apoptosis in human immune deficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. We have assessed functional and physical interactions between Tat and the Egr family of transcription factors (Egr-1, -2, and -3), the latter two of which are major participants in activation-induced FasL up-regulation. Here we report that whereas Tat itself has no effect on the FasL promoter, it binds to Egr-2 and -3 and synergizes with them to superinduce expression of a FasL promoter-driven reporter. A Tat molecule containing a single amino acid substitution that results in the loss of transactivation activity for the HIV long terminal repeat still binds Egr-3 but can no longer enhance Egr-mediated transactivation of the FasL promoter. Furthermore, the mutated Tat acts as a dominant negative inhibitor, blocking the superinduction of FasL caused by wild type Tat. Because Tat is present in virus-infected cells and in the serum of HIV-infected individuals, these results suggest that increased expression of FasL in these circumstances may result from the cooperative activities of activation-induced Egrs and Tat."
9811611,A dileucine motif in HIV-1 Nef is essential for sorting into clathrin-coated pits and for downregulation of CD4.,"Nef, a approximately 200 residue multifunctional regulatory protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), interacts with components of host cell signal transduction and clathrin-dependent protein sorting pathways. The downregulation of surface CD4 molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens by Nef is believed to be important in AIDS pathogenesis [1-7]. Nef contains a globular core domain and two disordered segments--a myristylated arm at the amino terminus and a carboxy-terminal loop projecting from the globular core [8,9]. Here, we aimed to determine the sorting signals in HIV-1 Nef that were responsible for its involvement in the clathrin-mediated pathway. We found that a sequence in the carboxy-terminal disordered loop of Nef is essential for downregulation of CD4. This sequence resembles the dileucine motif, one of two well-characterized sorting signals that target membrane proteins to clathrin-coated vesicles. The dileucine-motif-containing segment of Nef bound directly and specifically to the beta-adaptin subunit of the clathrin adaptor complexes AP-1 and AP-2, which are responsible for recruiting sorted proteins into coated pits. Unlike wild-type Nef, a mutant form of Nef that lacked the dileucine motif did not localize to clathrin-coated pits and did not downregulate CD4 expression, although it could downregulate MHC class I surface expression. Thus, the dileucine motif in HIV-1 is required for CD4 downregulation and for interaction with clathrin adaptor complexes."
9847347,The ability of herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate-early protein Vmw110 to bind to a ubiquitin-specific protease contributes to its roles in the activation of gene expression and stimulation of virus replication.,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate-early protein Vmw110 stimulates the onset of virus infection and is required for efficient reactivation from latency. In transfection assays, Vmw110 is a potent activator of gene expression, but its mode of action has yet to be determined. Previous work has shown that Vmw110 localizes to specific intranuclear structures known as ND10, PML bodies, or PODs and causes the disruption of these domains. The ability of Vmw110 to disrupt ND10 correlates with its biological activities in infected and transfected cells. It has also been found that Vmw110 binds strongly and specifically to a ubiquitin-specific protease known as HAUSP, itself a component of a subset of ND10. In this study we have investigated the role of HAUSP in Vmw110 activity; single amino acid residues of Vmw110 required for the interaction were identified, and the effects of mutation of these residues in infected and transfected cells were then assayed. The results indicate that the ability to bind to HAUSP contributes to the functional activities of Vmw110."
9034339,A novel ubiquitin-specific protease is dynamically associated with the PML nuclear domain and binds to a herpesvirus regulatory protein.,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate-early protein Vmw110 is a non-specific activator of gene expression and is required for efficient initiation of the viral lytic cycle. Since Vmw110-deficient viruses reactivate inefficiently in mouse latency models it has been suggested that Vmw110 plays a role in the balance between the latent and lytic states of the virus. The mechanisms by which Vmw110 achieves these functions are poorly understood. Vmw110 migrates to discrete nuclear structures (ND10) which contain the cellular PML protein, and in consequence PML and other constituent proteins are dispersed. In addition, Vmw110 binds to a cellular protein of approximately 135 kDa, and its interactions with the 135 kDa protein and ND10 contribute to its ability to stimulate gene expression and viral lytic growth. In this report we identify the 135 kDa protein as a novel member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family. The protease is distributed in the nucleus in a micropunctate pattern with a limited number of larger discrete foci, some of which co-localize with PML in ND10. At early times of virus infection, the presence of Vmw110 increases the proportion of ND10 which contain the ubiquitin-specific protease. These results identify a novel, transitory component of ND10 and implicate a previously uncharacterized ubiquitin-dependent pathway in the control of viral gene expression."
11298454,HIV-1 Nef inhibits ASK1-dependent death signalling providing a potential mechanism for protecting the infected host cell.,"In vivo infection of lymphatic tissues by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) leads to enhanced apoptosis, which prominently involves uninfected bystander cells. Increased killing of such bystander cells is mediated in part through Nef induction of Fas ligand (FasL) expression on the surface of the virally infected T cells. The subsequent interaction of FasL with Fas (CD95) displayed on neighbouring cells, including HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, may lead to bystander cell killing and thus forms an important mechanism of immune evasion. As HIV-1 also enhances Fas expression on virally infected cells, it is unclear how these hosts avoid rapid cell-autonomous apoptosis mediated through cis ligation of Fas by FasL. Here we show that HIV-1 Nef associates with and inhibits apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a serine/threonine kinase that forms a common and key signalling intermediate in the Fas and tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) death-signalling pathways. The interaction of Nef with ASK1 inhibits both Fas- and TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis, as well as the activation of the downstream c-Jun amino-terminal kinase. Our findings reveal a strategy by which HIV-1 Nef promotes the killing of bystander cells through the induction of FasL, while simultaneously protecting the HIV-1-infected host cell from these same pro-apoptotic signals through its interference with ASK1 function."
11384967,"The histone acetyltransferase, hGCN5, interacts with and acetylates the HIV transactivator, Tat.","Factor acetyltransferase activity associated with several histone acetyltransferases plays a key role in the control of transcription. Here we report that hGCN5, a well known histone acetyltransferase, specifically interacts with and acetylates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transactivator protein, Tat. The interaction between Tat and hGCN5 is direct and involves the acetyltransferase and the bromodomain regions of hGCN5, as well as a limited region of Tat encompassing the cysteine-rich domain of the protein. Tat lysines 50 and 51, target of acetylation by p300/CBP, were also found to be acetylated by hGCN5. The acetylation of these two lysines by p300/CBP has been recently shown to stimulate Tat transcriptional activity and accordingly, we have found that hGCN5 can considerably enhance Tat-dependent transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. These data highlight the importance of the acetylation of lysines 50 and 51 in the function of Tat, since different histone acetyltransferases involved in distinct signaling pathways, GCN5 and p300/CBP, converge to acetylate Tat on the same site."
9054408,Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5.,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB."
7859737,Proline-rich (PxxP) motifs in HIV-1 Nef bind to SH3 domains of a subset of Src kinases and are required for the enhanced growth of Nef+ viruses but not for down-regulation of CD4.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus Nef proteins contain a conserved motif with the minimal consensus (PxxP) site for Src homology region 3 (SH3)-mediated protein-protein interactions. Nef PxxP motifs show specific binding to biotinylated SH3 domains of Hck and Lyn, but not to those of other tested Src family kinases or less related proteins. A unique cooperative role of a distant proline is also observed. Endogenous Hck of monocytic U937 cells can be specifically precipitated by matrix-bound HIV-1 Nef, but not by mutant protein lacking PxxP. Intact Nef PxxP motifs are dispensable for Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation, but are required for the higher in vitro replicative potential of Nef+ viruses. Thus, CD4 down-regulation and promotion of viral growth are two distinct functions of Nef, and the latter is mediated via SH3 binding."
10944537,HIV-1 TAR RNA enhances the interaction between Tat and cyclin T1.,"Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), Tat activates elongation of RNA polymerase II transcription at the HIV-1 promoter through interaction with the cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor complex, P-TEFb. Binding of Tat to CycT1 induces cooperative binding of the P-TEFb complex onto nascent HIV-1 TAR RNA. Here the specific interaction between Tat protein, human cyclin T1, and HIV-1 TAR RNA was analyzed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, using fluorescein-labeled TAR RNA and a rhodamine-labeled Tat protein synthesized through solid-phase chemistry. We find that CycT1 remodels the structure of Tat to enhance its affinity for TAR RNA and that TAR RNA further enhances the interaction between Tat and CycT1. We conclude that TAR RNA nucleates the formation of the Tat.P-TEFb complex through an induced fit mechanism."
11504720,Visualization of in vivo direct interaction between HIV-1 TAT and human cyclin T1 in specific subcellular compartments by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.,"Human cyclin T1, a component of the P-TEFb kinase complex, was originally identified through its biochemical interaction with the Tat transactivator protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Current understanding suggests that binding of Tat to P-TEFb is required to promote efficient transcriptional elongation of viral RNAs. However, the dynamics and the subnuclear localization of this process are still largely unexplored in vivo. Here we exploit high resolution fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to visualize and quantitatively analyze the direct interaction between Tat and cyclin T1 inside the cells. We observed that cyclin T1 resides in specific subnuclear foci which are in close contact with nuclear speckles and that Tat determines its redistribution outside of these compartments. Consistent with this observation, strong FRET was observed between the two proteins both in the cytoplasm and in regions of the nucleus outside of cyclin T1 foci and overlapping with Tat localization. These results are consistent with a model by which Tat recruits cyclin T1 outside of the nuclear compartments where the protein resides to promote transcriptional activation."
20727575,Structural basis of semaphorin-plexin recognition and viral mimicry from Sema7A and A39R complexes with PlexinC1.,"Repulsive signaling by Semaphorins and Plexins is crucial for the development and homeostasis of the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Sema7A acts as both an immune and a neural Semaphorin through PlexinC1, and A39R is a Sema7A mimic secreted by smallpox virus. We report the structures of Sema7A and A39R complexed with the Semaphorin-binding module of PlexinC1. Both structures show two PlexinC1 molecules symmetrically bridged by Semaphorin dimers, in which the Semaphorin and PlexinC1 beta propellers interact in an edge-on, orthogonal orientation. Both binding interfaces are dominated by the insertion of the Semaphorin's 4c-4d loop into a deep groove in blade 3 of the PlexinC1 propeller. A39R appears to achieve Sema7A mimicry by preserving key Plexin-binding determinants seen in the mammalian Sema7A complex that have evolved to achieve higher affinity binding to the host-derived PlexinC1. The complex structures support a conserved Semaphorin-Plexin recognition mode and suggest that Plexins are activated by dimerization."
16646632,Crystal structure of the HSV-1 Fc receptor bound to Fc reveals a mechanism for antibody bipolar bridging.,"Herpes simplex virus type-1 expresses a heterodimeric Fc receptor, gE-gI, on the surfaces of virions and infected cells that binds the Fc region of host immunoglobulin G and is implicated in the cell-to-cell spread of virus. gE-gI binds immunoglobulin G at the basic pH of the cell surface and releases it at the acidic pH of lysosomes, consistent with a role in facilitating the degradation of antiviral antibodies. Here we identify the C-terminal domain of the gE ectodomain (CgE) as the minimal Fc-binding domain and present a 1.78-angstroms CgE structure. A 5-angstroms gE-gI/Fc crystal structure, which was independently verified by a theoretical prediction method, reveals that CgE binds Fc at the C(H)2-C(H)3 interface, the binding site for several mammalian and bacterial Fc-binding proteins. The structure identifies interface histidines that may confer pH-dependent binding and regions of CgE implicated in cell-to-cell spread of virus. The ternary organization of the gE-gI/Fc complex is compatible with antibody bipolar bridging, which can interfere with the antiviral immune response."
11027293,Human scribble (Vartul) is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the high-risk papillomavirus E6 proteins and the E6AP ubiquitin-protein ligase.,"The high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 proteins stimulate the ubiquitination and degradation of p53, dependent on the E6AP ubiquitin-protein ligase. Other proteins have also been shown to be targeted for degradation by E6, including hDlg, the human homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster Discs large (Dlg) tumor suppressor. We show here that the human homolog of the Drosophila Scribble (Vartul) (hScrib) tumor suppressor protein is also targeted for ubiquitination by the E6-E6AP complex in vitro and that expression of E6 induces degradation of hScrib in vivo. Characterization of the E6AP-E6-hScrib complex indicated that hScrib binds directly to E6 and that the binding is mediated by the PDZ domains of hScrib and a carboxyl-terminal epitope conserved among the high-risk HPV E6 proteins. Green fluorescent protein-hScrib was localized to the periphery of MDCK cells, where it colocalized with ZO-1, a component of tight junctions. E6 expression resulted in loss of integrity of tight junctions, as measured by ZO-1 localization, and this effect was dependent on the PDZ binding epitope of E6. Thus, the high-risk HPV E6 proteins induce the degradation of the human homologs of two Drosophila PDZ domain-containing tumor suppressor proteins, hDlg and hScrib, both of which are associated with cell junction complexes. The fact that Scrib/Vart and Dlg appear to cooperate in a pathway that controls Drosophila epithelial cell growth suggests that the combined targeting of hScrib and hDlg is an important component of the biologic activity of high-risk HPV E6 proteins."
15016876,The binding of histone deacetylases and the integrity of zinc finger-like motifs of the E7 protein are essential for the life cycle of human papillomavirus type 31.,"The E7 oncoprotein of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) binds to and alters the action of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as members of the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of proteins as well as the histone deacetylases (HDACs). To examine the significance of the binding of E7 to HDACs in the viral life cycle, a mutational analysis of the E7 open reading frame was performed in the context of the complete HPV type 31 (HPV-31) genome. Human foreskin keratinocytes were transfected with wild-type HPV-31 genomes or HPV-31 genomes containing mutations in HDAC binding sequences as well as in the C-terminal zinc finger-like domain, and stable cell lines were isolated. All mutant genomes, except those with E7 mutations in the HDAC binding site, were found to be stably maintained extrachromosomally at an early passage following transfection. Upon further passage in culture, genomes containing mutations to the Rb binding domain as well as the zinc finger-like region quickly lost the ability to maintain episomal genomes. Genomes containing mutations abolishing E7 binding to HDACs or to Rb or mutations to the zinc finger-like motifs failed to extend the life span of transfected keratinocytes and caused cells to arrest at the same time as the untransfected keratinocytes. When induced to differentiate by suspension in methylcellulose, cells maintaining genomes with mutations in the Rb binding domain or the zinc finger-like motifs were impaired in their abilities to activate late viral functions. This study demonstrates that the interaction of E7 with HDACs and the integrity of the zinc finger-like motifs are essential for extending the life span of keratinocytes and for stable maintenance of viral genomes."
12551970,Nuclear entry of high-risk human papillomavirus type 16 E6 oncoprotein occurs via several pathways.,"The E6 oncoprotein of high-risk human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) interacts with several nuclear transcription factors and coactivators in addition to cytoplasmic proteins, suggesting that nuclear import of HPV16 E6 plays a role in the cellular transformation process. In this study we have investigated the nuclear import pathways of HPV16 E6 in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells. We found that HPV16 E6 interacted with the karyopherin (Kap) alpha2 adapter and could enter the nucleus via a classical Kap alpha2beta1-mediated pathway. Interestingly, HPV16 E6 also interacted, via its basic nuclear localization signal (NLS) located at the C terminus, with both Kap beta1 and Kap beta2 import receptors. Binding of RanGTP to these Kap betas inhibited their interaction with HPV16 E6 NLS. In agreement with these binding data, nuclear import of the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells could be mediated by either Kap beta1 or Kap beta2. Nuclear import via these pathways required RanGDP and was independent of GTP hydrolysis by Ran. Significantly, an E6(R124G) mutant had reduced nuclear import activity, and the E6 deletion mutant lacking (121)KKQR(124) was not imported into the nucleus. The data reveal that the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein interacts via its C-terminal NLS with several karyopherins and exploits these interactions to enter the nucleus of host cells via multiple pathways."
11971900,Nuclear import strategies of high risk HPV16 L1 major capsid protein.,"During the late phase of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the L1 major capsid proteins enter the nuclei of host epithelial cells and, together with the L2 minor capsid proteins, assemble the replicated viral DNA into virions. We investigated the nuclear import of the L1 major capsid protein of high risk HPV16. When digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated with HPV16 L1 capsomeres, the L1 protein was imported into the nucleus in a receptor-mediated manner. HPV16 L1 capsomeres formed complexes with Kap alpha2beta1 heterodimers via interaction with Kap alpha2. Accordingly, nuclear import of HPV16 L1 capsomeres was mediated by Kap alpha2beta1 heterodimers, required RanGDP and free GTP, and was independent of GTP hydrolysis. Remarkably, HPV16 L1 capsomeres also interacted with Kap beta2 and binding of RanGTP to Kap beta2 did not dissociate the HPV16 L1.Kap beta2 complex. Significantly, HPV16 L1 capsomeres inhibited the nuclear import of Kap beta2 and of a Kap beta2-specific M9-containing cargo. These data suggest that, during the productive stage of infection, while the HPV16 L1 major capsid protein enters the nucleus via the Kap alpha2beta1-mediated pathway to assemble the virions, it also inhibits the Kap beta2-mediated nuclear import of host hnRNP A1 protein and, in this way, favors virion formation."
11438528,Binding of p300/CBP co-activators by polyoma large T antigen.,"Small DNA tumor viruses such as simian virus 40 (SV40) and polyomavirus (Py) take advantage of host cell proteins to transcribe and replicate their DNA. Interactions between the viral T antigens and host proteins result in cell transformation and tumor induction. Large T antigen of SV40 interacts with p53, pRb/p107/p130 family members, and the cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP)/p300. Py large T antigen is known to interact only with pRb and p300 among these proteins. Here we report that Py large T binds to CBP in vivo and in vitro. In co-transfection assays, Py large T inhibits the co-activation functions of CBP/p300 in CREB-mediated transactivation but not in NF-kappa B-mediated transactivation. p53 appears not to be involved in the functions of CREB-mediated transactivation and is not essential for large T:CBP interaction. Mutations introduced into a region of Py large T with homology to adenovirus E1A and SV40 large T prevent binding to the co-activators. These mutant large T antigens fail to inhibit CREB-mediated transactivation. The CBP/p300-binding Py mutants are able to transform established rat embryo fibroblasts but are restricted in their ability to induce tumors in the newborn mouse, indicating that interaction of large T with the co-activators may be essential for virus replication and spread in the intact host."
10374970,Human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 interactions with Bak are conserved amongst E6 proteins from high and low risk HPV types.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) replication occurs in terminally differentiating epithelium, and requires the activation of cellular DNA replication proteins. Unscheduled DNA replication can result in the induction of apoptosis, and the viral E6 protein induces the degradation of p53 to prevent this. It has recently been shown that HPV-18 E6 can also stimulate the degradation of Bak, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. This report shows that the E6 proteins from HPV-18, HPV-16 and HPV-11 can all bind to Bak in vitro, stimulate its degradation in vivo and reduce Bak-induced apoptosis. However, the non-oncogenic HPV-11 E6 is less effective than the oncogenic E6 proteins in each of these assays, indicating that the ability of HPV to circumvent the apoptosis induced by Bak may contribute to the oncogenic potential of the virus."
11744716,Functional interaction between p/CAF and human papillomavirus E2 protein.,"p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (p/CAF), a transcriptional co-activator, interacts with co-activator p300/CBP and acidic transcription factors. p/CAF mediates transcriptional activation by acetylating nucleosomal histones and cellular factors. Previously we reported that CBP binds to human papillomavirus E2 and activates E2-dependent transcription (Lee, D., Lee, B., Kim, J., Kim, D. W., and Choe, J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 7045-7051). Here we show that p/CAF binds to the human papillomavirus E2 protein in vivo and in vitro and activates E2-dependent transcription. CBP along with p/CAF synergistically activates E2-dependent transcription. In addition, the histone acetylase activity of p/CAF is required for efficient activation of E2 transcriptional activity. These results suggest that p/CAF is a transcriptional co-activator of the human papillomavirus E2 protein."
9349482,Human papillomavirus type 16 E7 binds to the conserved carboxy-terminal region of the TATA box binding protein and this contributes to E7 transforming activity.,"We have previously shown that the human papillomavirus E7 proteins bind to the cellular TATA box binding protein (TBP). In this paper we show that the HPV-18 E6 and the HPV-16 E2 proteins will also bind TBP in vitro. This feature of virus proteins is conserved across many viral types and we were interested in determining whether these HPV proteins interacted with the same conserved region of the TBP molecule. A series of deletions was introduced into the TBP protein and its binding to these HPV proteins was measured. The previously well-characterized interaction between p53 and TBP was used for comparison. All four proteins were found to interact with the carboxy-terminal domain of the TBP protein, although the precise residues involved and the relative strengths of association differed between the different HPV proteins. Mutational analysis of HPV-16 E7 protein identified a stretch of four amino acids responsible for the binding to TBP. This mutant E7 protein possessed wild-type levels of transcriptional activity on the adenovirus E2 promoter but exhibited reduced transforming activity in cooperation with EJ-ras. These results demonstrate that the mechanisms of interaction between diverse viral proteins and TBP are similar and that, in the case of E7, this interaction may contribute to its transforming activity."
10809724,PKN binds and phosphorylates human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein.,"The high risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with carcinomas of cervix and other genital tumors. Previous studies have identified two viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, which are expressed in the majority of HPV-associated carcinomas. The ability of high risk HPV E6 protein to immortalize human mammary epithelial cells has provided a single gene model to study the mechanisms of E6-induced oncogenic transformation. In recent years, it has become clear that in addition to E6-induced degradation of p53 tumor suppressor protein, other targets of E6 are required for mammary epithelial cells immortalization. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interaction of HPV16 E6 with protein kinase PKN, a fatty acid- and Rho small G protein-activated serine/threonine kinase with a catalytic domain highly homologous to protein kinase C. We demonstrate direct binding of high risk HPV E6 proteins to PKN in wheat-germ lysate in vitro and in 293T cells in vivo. Importantly, E6 proteins of high risk HPVs but not low risk HPVs were able to bind PKN. Furthermore, all the immortalization-competent and many immortalization-non-competent E6 mutants bind PKN. These data suggest that binding to PKN may be required but not sufficient for immortalizing normal mammary epithelial cells. Finally, we show that PKN phosphorylates E6, demonstrating for the first time that HPV E6 is a phosphoprotein. Our finding suggests a novel link between HPV E6 mediated oncogenesis and regulation of a well known phosphorylation cascade."
10390359,Inhibition of the interferon-inducible protein kinase PKR by HCV E2 protein.,"Most isolates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are resistant to interferon, the only available therapy, but the mechanism underlying this resistance has not been defined. Here it is shown that the HCV envelope protein E2 contains a sequence identical with phosphorylation sites of the interferon-inducible protein kinase PKR and the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha, a target of PKR. E2 inhibited the kinase activity of PKR and blocked its inhibitory effect on protein synthesis and cell growth. This interaction of E2 and PKR may be one mechanism by which HCV circumvents the antiviral effect of interferon."
11278465,The tyrosine kinase Hck is an inhibitor of HIV-1 replication counteracted by the viral vif protein.,"The virus infectivity factor (Vif) protein facilitates the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in primary lymphocytes and macrophages. Its action is strongly dependent on the cellular environment, and it has been proposed that the Vif protein counteracts cellular activities that would otherwise limit HIV-1 replication. Using a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, we identified that Vif binds specifically to the Src homology 3 domain of Hck, a tyrosine kinase from the Src family. The interaction between Vif and the full-length Hck was further assessed by co-precipitation assays in vitro and in human cells. The Vif protein repressed the kinase activity of Hck and was not itself a substrate for Hck phosphorylation. Within one single replication cycle of HIV-1, Hck was able to inhibit the production and the infectivity of vif-deleted virus but not that of wild-type virus. Accordingly, HIV-1 vif- replication was delayed in Jurkat T cell clones stably expressing Hck. Our data demonstrate that Hck controls negatively HIV-1 replication and that this inhibition is suppressed by the expression of Vif. Hck, which is present in monocyte-macrophage cells, represents the first identified cellular inhibitor of HIV-1 replication overcome by Vif."
9832504,The interaction between HIV-1 Tat and human cyclin T1 requires zinc and a critical cysteine residue that is not conserved in the murine CycT1 protein.,"HIV-1 Tat activates transcription through binding to human cyclin T1, a regulatory subunit of the TAK/P-TEFb CTD kinase complex. Here we show that the cyclin domain of hCycT1 is necessary and sufficient to interact with Tat and promote cooperative binding to TAR RNA in vitro, as well as mediate Tat transactivation in vivo. A Tat:TAR recognition motif (TRM) was identified at the carboxy-terminal edge of the cyclin domain, and we show that hCycT1 can interact simultaneously with Tat and CDK9 on TAR RNA in vitro. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the hCycT1 TRM identified residues that are critical for the interaction with Tat and others that are required specifically for binding of the complex to TAR RNA. Interestingly, we find that the interaction between Tat and hCycT1 requires zinc as well as essential cysteine residues in both proteins. Cloning and characterization of the murine CycT1 protein revealed that it lacks a critical cysteine residue (C261) and forms a weak, zinc-independent complex with HIV-1 Tat that greatly reduces binding to TAR RNA. A point mutation in mCycT1 (Y261C) restores high-affinity, zinc-dependent binding to Tat and TAR in vitro, and rescues Tat transactivation in vivo. Although overexpression of hCycT1 in NIH3T3 cells strongly enhances transcription from an integrated proviral promoter, we find that this fails to overcome all blocks to productive HIV-1 infection in murine cells."
15824310,Herpes simplex virus 1 infected cell protein 0 forms a complex with CIN85 and Cbl and mediates the degradation of EGF receptor from cell surfaces.,"Infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) is a 775-residue multifunctional herpes simplex virus protein associated with numerous functions related to transactivation of gene expression and repression of host defenses to infection. We report that an uncharted domain of ICP0 located between residues 245 and 510 contains multiple SH3 domain binding motifs similar to those required for binding to CIN85, the M(r) 85,000 protein that interacts with Cbl. CIN85 and Cbl are involved in endocytosis and negative regulation of numerous receptor tyrosine kinases. We report that ICP0 binds CIN85 in a reciprocal manner and that the complexes pulled down by ICP0 also contain Cbl. We tested the role of ICP0 in the down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases by using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a prototypic receptor. In transfection assays, ICP0, in the absence of other viral genes, down-regulated EGF-dependent expression of a reporter gene (luciferase). ICP0 also down-regulated both total and cell surface levels of EGFR in EGF-independent manner. In wild-type virus-infected cells, the surface levels of EGFR were also decreased in the absence of EGF stimulation. Stimulation by EGF enhanced the decrease in surface EGFR. We conclude that ICP0 encodes SH3 domain binding sites that function to down-regulate signaling pathways associated with receptor tyrosine kinases. The results suggest that ICP0 precludes signaling to the infected cells through the receptor tyrosine kinases."
7588629,A single amino acid in the SH3 domain of Hck determines its high affinity and specificity in binding to HIV-1 Nef protein.,"We have examined the differential binding of Hck and Fyn to HIV-1 Nef to elucidate the structural basis of SH3 binding affinity and specificity. Full-length Nef bound to Hck SH3 with the highest affinity reported for an SH3-mediated interaction (KD 250 nM). In contrast to Hck, affinity of the highly homologous Fyn SH3 for Nef was too weak (KD > 20 microM) to be accurately determined. We show that this distinct specificity lies in a variable loop, the 'RT loop', positioned close to conserved SH3 residues implicated in the binding of proline-rich (PxxP) motifs. A mutant Fyn SH3 with a single amino acid substitution (R96I) in its RT loop had an affinity (KD 380 nM) for Nef comparable with that of Hck SH3. Based on additional mutagenesis studies we propose that the selective recognition of Nef by Hck SH3 is determined by hydrophobic interactions involving an isoleucine residue in its RT loop. Although Nef contains a PxxP motif which is necessary for the interaction with Hck SH3, high affinity binding was only observed for intact Nef protein. The binding of a peptide containing the Nef PxxP motif showed > 300-fold weaker affinity for Hck SH3 than full-length Nef."
7588773,Binding of human prothymosin alpha to the leucine-motif/activation domains of HTLV-I Rex and HIV-1 Rev.,"Rex of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) and Rev of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) are post-transcriptional regulators of viral gene expression. By means of affinity chromatography, we purified an 18-kDa cellular protein that bound to the conserved leucine-motif/activation domain of HTLV-I Rex or HIV-1 Rev. The protein that was purified through a Rev-affinity column was found to bind to Rex immunoprecipitated with anti-Rex IgG from an HTLV-I-producing cell line. We analyzed the purified approximately 18-kDa protein biochemically and identified it as prothymosin alpha. The binding activity of prothymosin alpha to Rev or Rex was completely abolished when the epsilon-amino groups of its lysine residues were chemically modified by N-succinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-diodo- phenyl)propionate. The functional relationship between the nuclear protein prothymosin alpha and Rex-Rev is discussed."
7592647,"Association of human Pur alpha with the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, regulates binding to the single-stranded DNA Pur alpha recognition element.","The retinoblastoma protein, Rb, is detected in extracts of monkey CV-1 cells complexed with Pur alpha, a sequence-specific single-stranded DNA-binding protein implicated in control of gene transcription and DNA replication. These complexes can be immunoextracted from cell lysates using monoclonal antibodies to either Pur alpha or Rb. The Pur alpha-Rb complexes contain a form of Pur alpha with extensive post-synthetic modification, as demonstrated following expression of Pur alpha cDNA fused to a 9-amino acid epitope tag. Human Pur alpha, expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, specifically binds to the hypophosphorylated form of Rb with an affinity as high as that of SV40 large T-antigen. In the absence of DNA, glutathione S-transferase-Pur alpha binds to p56RB, an NH2-terminal-truncated Rb protein purified from Escherichia coli, containing the T-antigen binding domain, to form multimeric complexes. The single-stranded DNA Pur alpha recognition element disrupts these complexes. Conversely, high concentrations of p56RB prevent Pur alpha binding to DNA. Through use of a series of deletion mutants, the DNA binding activity of Pur alpha is localized to a series of modular amino acid repeats. Rb binding involves a Pur alpha region with limited homology to the Rb-binding region of SV40 large T-antigen. Binding of Pur alpha to p56RB, the COOH-terminal portion of Rb, is inhibited by a synthetic peptide containing the T-antigen Rb-binding motif."
17350572,Structural and biochemical studies of ALIX/AIP1 and its role in retrovirus budding.,"ALIX/AIP1 functions in enveloped virus budding, endosomal protein sorting, and many other cellular processes. Retroviruses, including HIV-1, SIV, and EIAV, bind and recruit ALIX through YPX(n)L late-domain motifs (X = any residue; n = 1-3). Crystal structures reveal that human ALIX is composed of an N-terminal Bro1 domain and a central domain that is composed of two extended three-helix bundles that form elongated arms that fold back into a ""V."" The structures also reveal conformational flexibility in the arms that suggests that the V domain may act as a flexible hinge in response to ligand binding. YPX(n)L late domains bind in a conserved hydrophobic pocket on the second arm near the apex of the V, whereas CHMP4/ESCRT-III proteins bind a conserved hydrophobic patch on the Bro1 domain, and both interactions are required for virus budding. ALIX therefore serves as a flexible, extended scaffold that connects retroviral Gag proteins to ESCRT-III and other cellular-budding machinery."
18267072,Adenovirus serotype 5 hexon mediates liver gene transfer.,"Adenoviruses are used extensively as gene transfer agents, both experimentally and clinically. However, targeting of liver cells by adenoviruses compromises their potential efficacy. In cell culture, the adenovirus serotype 5 fiber protein engages the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) to bind cells. Paradoxically, following intravascular delivery, CAR is not used for liver transduction, implicating alternate pathways. Recently, we demonstrated that coagulation factor (F)X directly binds adenovirus leading to liver infection. Here, we show that FX binds to the Ad5 hexon, not fiber, via an interaction between the FX Gla domain and hypervariable regions of the hexon surface. Binding occurs in multiple human adenovirus serotypes. Liver infection by the FX-Ad5 complex is mediated through a heparin-binding exosite in the FX serine protease domain. This study reveals an unanticipated function for hexon in mediating liver gene transfer in vivo."
16493710,"Surface plasmon resonance imaging protein arrays for analysis of triple protein interactions of HPV, E6, E6AP, and p53.","We have developed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based protein microarray to study protein-protein interactions in a high-throughput mode. As a model system, triple protein interactions have been explored with human papillomaviral E6 protein, tumor suppressor p53, and ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to be a causative agent of cervical cancer. Upon infection, the viral E6 protein forms a heterotrimeric protein complex with p53 and E6AP. The formation of the complex eventually results in the degradation of p53. In the present study, a GST-fused E6AP protein was layered onto a glutathione (GSH)-modified gold chip surface. The specific binding of GST-E6AP protein onto the gold chip surface was facilitated through the affinity of GST to its specific ligand GSH. The interacting proteins (E6 and/or p53) were then spotted. Detection of the interaction was performed using a SPR imaging (SPRI) technique. The resulting SPRI intensity data showed that the protein-protein interactions of E6AP, E6, and p53 were detected in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the SPRI-based microarray system can be an effective tool to study protein-protein interactions where multiple proteins are involved."
12730686,Structural insights into the catalytic mechanism of cyclophilin A.,"Cyclophilins constitute a ubiquitous protein family whose functions include protein folding, transport and signaling. They possess both sequence-specific binding and proline cis-trans isomerase activities, as exemplified by the interaction between cyclophilin A (CypA) and the HIV-1 CA protein. Here, we report crystal structures of CypA in complex with HIV-1 CA protein variants that bind preferentially with the substrate proline residue in either the cis or the trans conformation. Cis- and trans-Pro substrates are accommodated within the enzyme active site by rearrangement of their N-terminal residues and with minimal distortions in the path of the main chain. CypA Arg55 guanidinium group probably facilitates catalysis by anchoring the substrate proline oxygen and stabilizing sp3 hybridization of the proline nitrogen in the transition state."
11877480,"Structure of a complex of the human alpha/beta T cell receptor (TCR) HA1.7, influenza hemagglutinin peptide, and major histocompatibility complex class II molecule, HLA-DR4 (DRA*0101 and DRB1*0401): insight into TCR cross-restriction and alloreactivity.","The alpha/beta T cell receptor (TCR) HA1.7 specific for the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen peptide from influenza A virus is HLA-DR1 restricted but cross-reactive for the HA peptide presented by the allo-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule HLA-DR4. We report here the structure of the HA1.7/DR4/HA complex, determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.4 A. The overall structure of this complex is very similar to the previously reported structure of the HA1.7/DR1/HA complex. Amino acid sequence differences between DR1 and DR4, which are located deep in the peptide binding groove and out of reach for direct contact by the TCR, are able to indirectly influence the antigenicity of the pMHC surface by changing the conformation of HA peptide residues at position P5 and P6. Although TCR HA1.7 is cross-reactive for HA presented by DR1 and DR4 and tolerates these conformational differences, other HA-specific TCRs are sensitive to these changes. We also find a dependence of the width of the MHC class II peptide-binding groove on the sequence of the bound peptide by comparing the HA1.7/DR4/HA complex with the structure of DR4 presenting a collagen peptide. This structural study of TCR cross-reactivity emphasizes how MHC sequence differences can affect TCR binding indirectly by moving peptide atoms."
15809419,Molecular recognition of an ADP-ribosylating Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme by RalA GTPase.,"C3 exoenzymes (members of the ADP-ribosyltranferase family) are produced by Clostridium botulinum (C3bot1 and -2), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), Bacillus cereus (C3cer), and Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau1-3). These exoenzymes lack a translocation domain but are known to specifically inactivate Rho GTPases in host target cells. Here, we report the crystal structure of C3bot1 in complex with RalA (a GTPase of the Ras subfamily) and GDP at a resolution of 2.66 A. RalA is not ADP-ribosylated by C3 exoenzymes but inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3bot1, C3lim, and C3cer to different extents. The structure provides an insight into the molecular interactions between C3bot1 and RalA involving the catalytic ADP-ribosylating turn-turn (ARTT) loop from C3bot1 and helix alpha4 and strand beta6 (which are not part of the GDP-binding pocket) from RalA. The structure also suggests a molecular explanation for the different levels of C3-exoenzyme inhibition by RalA and why RhoA does not bind C3bot1 in this manner."
15837194,"Same structure, different function crystal structure of the Epstein-Barr virus IL-10 bound to the soluble IL-10R1 chain.","Human IL-10 (hIL-10) is a cytokine that modulates diverse immune responses. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome contains an IL-10 homolog (vIL-10) that shares high sequence and structural similarity with hIL-10. Although vIL-10 suppresses inflammatory responses like hIL-10, it cannot activate many other immunostimulatory functions performed by the cellular cytokine. These functional differences have been correlated with the approximately 1000-fold lower affinity of vIL-10, compared to hIL-10, for the IL-10R1 receptor chain. To define the structural basis for these observations, crystal structures of vIL-10 and a vIL-10 point mutant were determined bound to the soluble IL-10R1 receptor fragment (sIL-10R1) at 2.8 and 2.7 A resolution, respectively. The structures reveal that subtle changes in the conformation and dynamics of the vIL-10 AB and CD loops and an orientation change of vIL-10 on sIL-10R1 are the main factors responsible for vIL-10's reduced affinity for sIL-10R1 and its distinct biological profile."
12093920,Crystal structure of human cytomegalovirus IL-10 bound to soluble human IL-10R1.,"Human IL-10 (hIL-10) modulates critical immune and inflammatory responses by way of interactions with its high- (IL-10R1) and low-affinity (IL-10R2) cell surface receptors. Human cytomegalovirus exploits the IL-10 signaling pathway by expressing a functional viral IL-10 homolog (cmvIL-10), which shares only 27% sequence identity with hIL-10 yet signals through IL-10R1 and IL-10R2. To define the molecular basis of this virus-host interaction, we determined the 2.7-A crystal structure of cmvIL-10 bound to the extracellular fragment of IL-10R1 (sIL-10R1). The structure reveals cmvIL-10 forms a disulfide-linked homodimer that binds two sIL-10R1 molecules. Although cmvIL-10 and hIL-10 share similar intertwined topologies and sIL-10R1 binding sites, their respective interdomain angles differ by approximately 40 degrees. This difference results in a striking re-organization of the IL-10R1s in the putative cell surface complex. Solution binding studies show cmvIL-10 and hIL-10 share essentially identical affinities for sIL-10R1 whereas the Epstein-Barr virus IL-10 homolog (ebvIL-10), whose structure is highly similar to hIL-10, exhibits a approximately 20-fold reduction in sIL-10R1 affinity. Our results suggest cmvIL-10 and ebvIL-10 have evolved different molecular mechanisms to engage the IL-10 receptors that ultimately enhance the respective ability of their virus to escape immune detection."
12456874,Effects of deletion of streptokinase residues 48-59 on plasminogen activation.,"Streptokinase (SK) is a thrombolytic agent widely used for the clinical treatment of clotting disorders such as heart attack. The treatment is based on the ability of SK to bind plasminogen (Pg) or plasmin (Pm), forming complexes that proteolytically activate other Pg molecules to Pm, which carries out fibrinolysis. SK contains three major domains. The N-terminal domain, SKalpha, provides the complex with substrate recognition towards Pg. SKalpha contains a unique mobile loop, residues 45-70, absent in the corresponding domains of other bacterial Pg activators. To study the roles of this loop, we deleted 12 residues in this loop in both full-length SK and the SKalpha fragment. Kinetic data indicate that this loop participates in the recognition of substrate Pg, but does not function in the active site formation in the activator complex. Two crystal structures of the deletion mutant of SKalpha (SKalpha(delta)) complexed with the protease domain of Pg were determined. While the structure of SKalpha(delta) is essentially the same as this domain in full-length SK, the mode of SK-Pg interaction was however different from a previously observed structure. Even though mutagenesis studies indicated that the current complex represents a minor interacting form in solution, the binding to SKalpha(delta) triggered similar conformational changes in the Pg active site in both crystal forms."
11828325,Structural basis for CDK6 activation by a virus-encoded cyclin.,"Cyclin from herpesvirus saimiri (Vcyclin) preferentially forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) from primate host cells. These complexes show higher kinase activity than host cell CDKs in complex with cellular cyclins and are resistant to cyclin-dependent inhibitory proteins (CDKIs). The crystal structure of human CDK6--Vcyclin in an active state was determined to 3.1 A resolution to better understand the structural basis of CDK6 activation by viral cyclins. The unphosphorylated CDK6 in complex with Vcyclin has many features characteristic of cyclinA-activated, phosphorylated CDK2. There are, however, differences in the conformation at the tip of the T-loop and its interactions with Vcyclin. Residues in the N-terminal extension of Vcyclin wrap around the tip of the CDK6 T-loop and form a short beta-sheet with the T-loop backbone. These interactions lead to a 20% larger buried surface in the CDK6--Vcyclin interface than in the CDK2--cyclinA complex and are probably largely responsible for the specificity of Vcyclin for CDK6 and resistance of the complex to inhibition by INK-type CDKIs."
7788293,Crystal structure of the C2 fragment of streptococcal protein G in complex with the Fc domain of human IgG.,"Streptococcal protein G comprises two or three domains that bind to the constant Fc region of most mammalian immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs). Protein G is functionally related to staphylococcal protein A, with which it shares neither sequence nor structural homology."
8980234,Crystal structure of human cyclophilin A bound to the amino-terminal domain of HIV-1 capsid.,"The HIV-1 capsid protein forms the conical core structure at the center of the mature virion. Capsid also binds the human peptidyl prolyl isomerase, cyclophilin A, thereby packaging the enzyme into the virion. Cyclophilin A subsequently performs an essential function in HIV-1 replication, possibly helping to disassemble the capsid core upon infection. We report the 2.36 A crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 capsid (residues 1-151) in complex with human cyclophilin A. A single exposed capsid loop (residues 85-93) binds in the enzyme's active site, and Pro-90 adopts an unprecedented trans conformation. The structure suggests how cyclophilin A can act as a sequence-specific binding protein and a nonspecific prolyl isomerase. In the crystal lattice, capsid molecules assemble into continuous planar strips. Side by side association of these strips may allow capsid to form the surface of the viral core. Cyclophilin A could then function by weakening the association between capsid strips, thereby promoting disassembly of the viral core."
18713862,Crystal structures of fibronectin-binding sites from Staphylococcus aureus FnBPA in complex with fibronectin domains.,"Staphylococcus aureus can adhere to and invade endothelial cells by binding to the human protein fibronectin (Fn). FnBPA and FnBPB, cell wall-attached proteins from S. aureus, have multiple, intrinsically disordered, high-affinity binding repeats (FnBRs) for Fn. Here, 30 years after the first report of S. aureus/Fn interactions, we present four crystal structures that together comprise the structures of two complete FnBRs, each in complex with four of the N-terminal modules of Fn. Each approximately 40-residue FnBR forms antiparallel strands along the triple-stranded beta-sheets of four sequential F1 modules ((2-5)F1) with each FnBR/(2-5)F1 interface burying a total surface area of approximately 4,300 A(2). The structures reveal the roles of residues conserved between S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes FnBRs and show that there are few linker residues between FnBRs. The ability to form large intermolecular interfaces with relatively few residues has been proposed to be a feature of disordered proteins, and S. aureus/Fn interactions provide an unusual illustration of this efficiency."
10567268,"Structural analysis of the mechanism of adenovirus binding to its human cellular receptor, CAR.","Binding of virus particles to specific host cell surface receptors is known to be an obligatory step in infection even though the molecular basis for these interactions is not well characterized. The crystal structure of the adenovirus fiber knob domain in complex with domain I of its human cellular receptor, coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), is presented here. Surface-exposed loops on knob contact one face of CAR, forming a high-affinity complex. Topology mismatches between interacting surfaces create interfacial solvent-filled cavities and channels that may be targets for antiviral drug therapy. The structure identifies key determinants of binding specificity, which may suggest ways to modify the tropism of adenovirus-based gene therapy vectors."
11511370,Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D bound to the human receptor HveA.,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection requires binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein D (gD) to cell surface receptors. We report the X-ray structures of a soluble, truncated ectodomain of gD both alone and in complex with the ectodomain of its cellular receptor HveA. Two bound anions suggest possible binding sites for another gD receptor, a 3-O-sulfonated heparan sulfate. Unexpectedly, the structures reveal a V-like immunoglobulin (Ig) fold at the core of gD that is closely related to cellular adhesion molecules and flanked by large N- and C-terminal extensions. The receptor binding segment of gD, an N-terminal hairpin, appears conformationally flexible, suggesting that a conformational change accompanying binding might be part of the viral entry mechanism."
15474020,Protein A--a new ligand for human C-reactive protein.,"Phosphorylcholine (PC) is a classical ligand of C-reactive protein (CRP), a clinically important acute phase protein. In search of new ligands, CRPs were affinity-purified from several pathological samples, which exhibited distinct molecular variants induced in different diseases. Both glycosylated and non-glycosylated CRPs showed calcium-independent differential-binding to Staphylococcus aureus cell-surface Protein A. CRP possesses separate binding sites for Protein A and PC with different binding constants. We have demonstrated that Protein A is another ligand in addition to PC establishing an extended definition of CRP. Protein A binding may impart immunomodulatory roles of CRP in combating microorganisms or other foreign materials."
17363894,Granzyme H destroys the function of critical adenoviral proteins required for viral DNA replication and granzyme B inhibition.,"Granzymes are key components of the immune response that play important roles in eliminating host cells infected by intracellular pathogens. Several granzymes are potent inducers of cell death. However, whether granzymes use additional mechanisms to exert their antipathogen activity remains elusive. Here, we show that in adenovirus-infected cells in which granzyme B (gzmB) and downstream apoptosis pathways are inhibited, granzyme H (gzmH), an orphan granzyme without known function, directly cleaves the adenovirus DNA-binding protein (DBP), a viral component absolutely required for viral DNA replication. We directly addressed the functional consequences of the cleavage of the DBP by gzmH through the generation of a virus that encodes a gzmH-resistant DBP. This virus demonstrated that gzmH directly induces an important decay in viral DNA replication. Interestingly, gzmH also cleaves the adenovirus 100K assembly protein, a major inhibitor of gzmB, and relieves gzmB inhibition. These results provide the first evidence that granzymes can mediate antiviral activity through direct cleavage of viral substrates, and further suggest that different granzymes have synergistic functions to outflank viral defenses that block host antiviral activities."
17717529,Poliovirus entry into human brain microvascular cells requires receptor-induced activation of SHP-2.,"Viruses use specific receptor molecules to bind selectively to target cells. Receptors have often been considered as mere docking sites, but they may also possess intrinsic signaling capacities that serve to prime the cell for entry and infection. Poliovirus (PV) initiates infection by binding to the PV receptor (PVR) and causes paralytic poliomyelitis by replicating within motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord. We have examined the process by which PV enters cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier. We found that PV enters HBMEC by dynamin-dependent caveolar endocytosis, and that entry depends on intracellular signals triggered by virus attachment to PVR. Tyrosine kinase and RhoA GTPase activation initiated by PVR ligation were both essential. Virus attachment also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PVR; this permitted the association of PVR with SHP-2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase whose activation was required for entry and infection. The results indicate that receptor-induced signals promote virus entry and suggest a role for tyrosine phosphatases in viral pathogenesis."
17486070,Oncogenic activation of c-Abl in non-small cell lung cancer cells lacking FUS1 expression: inhibition of c-Abl by the tumor suppressor gene product Fus1.,"In lung cancer, frequent loss of one allele of chromosome 3p is seen in both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), providing evidence of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in this chromosomal region. The mechanism of Fus1 tumor suppressor activity is unknown. We have found that a Fus1 peptide inhibits the Abl tyrosine kinase in vitro (IC(50) 35 microM). The inhibitory Fus1 sequence was derived from a region that was deleted in a mutant FUS1 gene (FUS1 (1-80)) detected in some lung cancer cell lines. Importantly, a stearic acid-modified form of this peptide was required for the inhibition, but stearic acid alone was not inhibitory. Two NSCLC cell lines, which lack expression of wild-type Fus1, contain activated c-Abl. Forced expression of an inducible FUS1 cDNA in H1299 NSCLC cells decreased levels of activated c-Abl and inhibited its tyrosine kinase activity. Similarly, treatment of c-Abl immune complexes with the inhibitory Fus1 peptide also reduced the level of c-Abl in these immune complexes. The size and number of colonies of the NSCLC cell line, H1,299, in soft agar was strongly inhibited by the Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Co-expression of FUS1 and c-ABL in COS1 cells blocked activation of c-Abl tyrosine kinase. In contrast, co-expression of mutant FUS1 (1-80) with c-ABL had little inhibitory activity against c-Abl. These findings provide strong evidence that c-Abl is a possible target in NSCLC patients that have reduced expression of Fus1 in their tumor cells."
17097642,Regulation of RKIP binding to the N-region of the Raf-1 kinase.,"The Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) binds to Raf-1 interfering with binding of the MEK substrate and potentially also Raf-1 activation. In response to mitogen stimulation RKIP dissociates from Raf-1 and later re-associates. Here, using a combination of mutational approaches, biochemical studies, peptide arrays and plasmon surface resonance (BIAcore), we fine map and characterize a minimal 24 amino acid long RKIP binding domain in the Raf-1 N-region, which consists of constitutive elements at both flanks and a center element that is regulated by phosphorylation and enhances the re-binding of RKIP to Raf-1 in the later phase of mitogen stimulation."
18048335,Human papillomaviruses activate caspases upon epithelial differentiation to induce viral genome amplification.,"The life cycle of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is linked to epithelial differentiation, with late viral events restricted to the uppermost stratified layers. Our studies indicated that HPV activates capases-3, -7, and -9 upon differentiation, whereas minimal activation was observed in differentiating normal keratinocytes. Activation occurred in the absence of significant levels of apoptosis, suggesting a potential role for caspases in the viral life cycle. In support of this, the addition of caspase inhibitors significantly impaired differentiation-dependent viral genome amplification. A conserved caspase cleavage motif was identified in the replication protein E1 ((46)DxxD(49)) that was targeted in vitro by both recombinant caspase-3 and caspase-7. Mutation of this site inhibited amplification of viral genomes, indicating that caspase cleavage is necessary for the productive viral life cycle. Our study demonstrates that HPV activates caspases upon differentiation to facilitate productive viral replication and represents a way by which HPV controls viral gene function in differentiating cells."
22810585,Viral immune modulators perturb the human molecular network by common and unique strategies.,"Viruses must enter host cells to replicate, assemble and propagate. Because of the restricted size of their genomes, viruses have had to evolve efficient ways of exploiting host cell processes to promote their own life cycles and also to escape host immune defence mechanisms. Many viral open reading frames (viORFs) with immune-modulating functions essential for productive viral growth have been identified across a range of viral classes. However, there has been no comprehensive study to identify the host factors with which these viORFs interact for a global perspective of viral perturbation strategies. Here we show that different viral perturbation patterns of the host molecular defence network can be deduced from a mass-spectrometry-based host-factor survey in a defined human cellular system by using 70 innate immune-modulating viORFs from 30 viral species. The 579 host proteins targeted by the viORFs mapped to an unexpectedly large number of signalling pathways and cellular processes, suggesting yet unknown mechanisms of antiviral immunity. We further experimentally verified the targets heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, the WNK (with-no-lysine) kinase family and USP19 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 19) as vulnerable nodes in the host cellular defence system. Evaluation of the impact of viral immune modulators on the host molecular network revealed perturbation strategies used by individual viruses and by viral classes. Our data are also valuable for the design of broad and specific antiviral therapies."
18024891,Xeroderma pigmentosum C is involved in Epstein Barr virus DNA replication.,"Cellular mismatch and base-excision repair machineries have been shown to be involved in Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) lytic DNA replication. We report here that nucleotide-excision repair (NER) may also play an important role in EBV lytic DNA replication. Firstly, the EBV BGLF4 kinase interacts with xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC), the critical DNA damage-recognition factor of NER, in yeast and in vitro, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Simultaneously, XPC was shown, by indirect immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assays, to interact and colocalize with BGLF4 in EBV-positive NA cells undergoing lytic viral replication. In addition, the efficiency of EBV DNA replication was reduced about 30-40 % by an XPC small interfering RNA. Expression of BGLF4 enhances cellular DNA-repair activity in p53-defective H1299/bcl2 cells in a host-cell reactivation assay. This enhancement was not observed in the XPC-mutant cell line XP4PA-SV unless complemented by ectopic XPC, suggesting that BGLF4 may stimulate DNA repair in an XPC-dependent manner. Overall, we suggest that the interaction of BGLF4 and XPC may be involved in DNA replication and repair and thereby enhance the efficiency of viral DNA replication."
19249677,Proapoptotic function of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein.,"The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) tumor suppressor blocks cell proliferation by repressing the E2F transcription factors. This inhibition is relieved through mitogen-induced phosphorylation of pRB, triggering E2F release and activation of cell-cycle genes. E2F1 can also activate proapoptotic genes in response to genotoxic or oncogenic stress. However, pRB's role in this context has not been established. Here we show that DNA damage and E1A-induced oncogenic stress promote formation of a pRB-E2F1 complex even in proliferating cells. Moreover, pRB is bound to proapoptotic promoters that are transcriptionally active, and pRB is required for maximal apoptotic response in vitro and in vivo. Together, these data reveal a direct role for pRB in the induction of apoptosis in response to genotoxic or oncogenic stress."
15967037,TRIM5alpha selectively binds a restriction-sensitive retroviral capsid.,"TRIM5 is a potent retrovirus inhibitor that targets viruses bearing particular capsid (CA) residues. In most primate species, retroviral restriction requires the C-terminal SPRY domain unique to the alpha-isoform of TRIM5, but the mechanism by which susceptible viruses are recognized and targeted for restriction is unknown. Here we show that TRIM5alpha binds retroviral CA from detergent-stripped virions in a SPRY-dependent manner with sufficient discrimination to account for the exquisite specificity of restriction."
7537265,"Functional interaction between c-Src and its mitotic target, Sam 68.","The c-Src tyrosine kinase phosphorylates and binds to a 68-kDa RNA-binding protein in mitotic cells. We have examined the mechanism and functional consequence of the interaction of c-Src with this protein, Sam 68 (Src associated in mitosis, 68 kDa). In whole cell homogenates, Sam 68 was the predominant substrate and binding partner of overexpressed c-Src. Mitotic, tyrosine-phosphorylated Sam 68 bound selectively to recombinant SH2 domains with significantly different affinities (c-Src approximately Ras GTPase activating protein > p85 alpha (amino-terminal) > Grb2 >> p85 alpha (COOH-terminal)). In vitro translated Sam 68 also bound selectively to recombinant SH3 domains, with the highest affinity for the Src and p85 alpha SH3 domains. SH3 binding was inhibited by specific Sam 68 peptides. In vitro translated Sam 68 bound directly to immobilized poly(U), and this was inhibited by binding of Src and p85 SH3 domains to Sam 68. The results suggest that the selection of Sam 68 as a mitotic target by c-Src is the result of highly specific interaction with SH2 and SH3 domains and that this interaction may modulate the RNA binding activity of Sam 68."
15271889,Alpha 1-antitrypsin binds to and interferes with functionality of EspB from atypical and typical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains.,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), including diffusely adhering atypical E. coli, strains use a type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins into the membrane and cytoplasm of infected cells. The E. coli secreted proteins A, B, and D (EspA, EspB, and EspD) are required for the formation of the characteristic attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. EspB and EspD are thought to form a translocation pore in the host cell membrane through which effector proteins are injected into the host cytosol. Besides its function in pore formation, EspB has been found in the cytosol and implicated to function as an effector protein. We screened for putative host cell proteins interacting with EspB of atypical EPEC strains and identified alpha(1)-antitrypsin (AAT) as a binding partner for EspB. AAT binds to EspB in pull-down and overlay experiments and also to EspD in overlay experiments. In agreement with the role of EspB and EspD in pore formation, EPEC-mediated hemolysis of red blood cells is strongly reduced by AAT in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that AAT interferes with type III secretion by inhibiting the formation of the translocation pore. This is further supported by a decreased actin polymerization after infection of HeLa or CaCo-2 cells with EPEC in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of AAT. In this study, we identify AAT as a new binding partner for EspB and EspD, suggesting a previously unappreciated role for AAT in host cell defense against EPEC infections and potentially also against other bacterial pathogens."
20711500,"The human-bacterial pathogen protein interaction networks of Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, and Yersinia pestis.","Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, and Yersinia pestis are bacterial pathogens that can cause anthrax, lethal acute pneumonic disease, and bubonic plague, respectively, and are listed as NIAID Category A priority pathogens for possible use as biological weapons. However, the interactions between human proteins and proteins in these bacteria remain poorly characterized leading to an incomplete understanding of their pathogenesis and mechanisms of immune evasion."
12093730,Structural basis for the reversible activation of a Rho protein by the bacterial toxin SopE.,"The bacterial enteropathogen Salmonella typhimurium employs a type III secretion system to inject bacterial toxins into the host cell cytosol. These toxins transiently activate Rho family GTP-binding protein-dependent signaling cascades to induce cytoskeletal rearrangements. One of these translocated Salmonella toxins, SopE, can activate Cdc42 in a Dbl-like fashion despite its lack of sequence similarity to Dbl-like proteins, the Rho-specific eukaryotic guanine nucleotide exchange factors. To elucidate the mechanism of SopE-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange, we have analyzed the structure of the complex between a catalytic fragment of SopE and Cdc42. SopE binds to and locks the switch I and switch II regions of Cdc42 in a conformation that promotes guanine nucleotide release. This conformation is strikingly similar to that of Rac1 in complex with the eukaryotic Dbl-like exchange factor Tiam1. However, the catalytic domain of SopE has an entirely different architecture from that of Tiam1 and interacts with the switch regions via different amino acids. Therefore, SopE represents the first example of a non-Dbl-like protein capable of inducing guanine nucleotide exchange in Rho family proteins."
19435845,Alphaherpesvirus US3-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is mediated by group A p21-activated kinases.,"The US3 protein is a viral serine/threonine kinase that is conserved among all members of the Alphaherpesvirinae. The US3 protein of different alphaherpesviruses causes dramatic alterations in the actin cytoskeleton, such as the disassembly of actin stress fibers and formation of cell projections, which have been associated with increased intercellular virus spread. Here, we find that inhibiting group A p21-activated kinases (PAKs), which are key regulators in Cdc42/Rac1 Rho GTPase signaling pathways, impairs US3-mediated actin alterations. By using PAK1(-/-) and PAK2(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), we show that US3-mediated stress fiber disassembly requires PAK2, whereas US3-mediated cell projection formation mainly is mediated by PAK1, also indicating that PAK1 and PAK2 can have different biological effects on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, US3 was found to bind and phosphorylate group A PAKs. Lack of group A PAKs in MEFs was correlated with inefficient virus spread. Thus, US3 induces its effect on the actin cytoskeleton via group A PAKs."
19913487,Structural basis for targeting of human RNA helicase DDX3 by poxvirus protein K7.,"Poxviruses are DNA viruses that express numerous proteins to subvert the host immune response. Vaccinia virus protein K7 adopts a Bcl-2 fold and displays structural and functional similarities to Toll-like receptor antagonist A52. Both proteins interact with IRAK2 and TRAF6 and suppress TLR-dependent NF-kappaB activation. However, unlike A52, K7 also forms a complex with RNA helicase DDX3 and antagonizes interferon-beta promoter induction. We have narrowed the K7 binding site to an N-terminal peptide motif of DDX3 ahead of its core RNA-helicase domains. The crystal structure of full-length K7 in complex with the DDX3 peptide reveals a thumblike projection of tandem phenalyalanine residues of DDX3 into a deep hydrophobic cleft. Mutagenesis of these phenylalanines abolishes the effects of DDX3 on interferon-beta promoter induction. The structure of K7-DDX3 reveals a novel binding mode by a viral Bcl-2 protein that antagonizes a key pathway in innate immunity."
19838190,A two-pronged strategy to suppress host protein synthesis by SARS coronavirus Nsp1 protein.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nsp1 protein suppresses host gene expression, including type I interferon production, by promoting host mRNA degradation and inhibiting host translation, in infected cells. We present evidence that nsp1 uses a novel, two-pronged strategy to inhibit host translation and gene expression. Nsp1 bound to the 40S ribosomal subunit and inactivated the translational activity of the 40S subunits. Furthermore, the nsp1-40S ribosome complex induced the modification of the 5' region of capped mRNA template and rendered the template RNA translationally incompetent. Nsp1 also induced RNA cleavage in templates carrying the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus, but not in those carrying IRES elements from hepatitis C or cricket paralysis viruses, demonstrating that the nsp1-induced RNA modification was template-dependent. We speculate that the mRNAs that underwent the nsp1-mediated modification are marked for rapid turnover by the host RNA degradation machinery."
19966799,A promiscuous alpha-helical motif anchors viral hijackers and substrate receptors to the CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase machinery.,"The cullin 4-DNA-damage-binding protein 1 (CUL4-DDB1) ubiquitin ligase machinery regulates diverse cellular functions and can be subverted by pathogenic viruses. Here we report the crystal structure of DDB1 in complex with a central fragment of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), whose DDB1-binding activity is important for viral infection. The structure reveals that HBx binds DDB1 through an alpha-helical motif, which is also found in the unrelated paramyxovirus SV5-V protein despite their sequence divergence. Our structure-based functional analysis suggests that, like SV5-V, HBx captures DDB1 to redirect the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ligase. We also identify the alpha-helical motif shared by these viral proteins in the cellular substrate-recruiting subunits of the E3 complex, the DDB1-CUL4-associated factors (DCAFs) that are functionally mimicked by the viral hijackers. Together, our studies reveal a common yet promiscuous structural element that is important for the assembly of cellular and virally hijacked CUL4-DDB1 E3 complexes."
20064372,A physical and regulatory map of host-influenza interactions reveals pathways in H1N1 infection.,"During the course of a viral infection, viral proteins interact with an array of host proteins and pathways. Here, we present a systematic strategy to elucidate the dynamic interactions between H1N1 influenza and its human host. A combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis and genome-wide expression profiling implicated hundreds of human factors in mediating viral-host interactions. These factors were then examined functionally through depletion analyses in primary lung cells. The resulting data point to potential roles for some unanticipated host and viral proteins in viral infection and the host response, including a network of RNA-binding proteins, components of WNT signaling, and viral polymerase subunits. This multilayered approach provides a comprehensive and unbiased physical and regulatory model of influenza-host interactions and demonstrates a general strategy for uncovering complex host-pathogen relationships."
19104048,Structural basis for antagonism of human interleukin 18 by poxvirus interleukin 18-binding protein.,"Human interleukin-18 (hIL-18) is a cytokine that plays an important role in inflammation and host defense against microbes. Its activity is regulated in vivo by a naturally occurring antagonist, the human IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP). Functional homologs of human IL-18BP are encoded by all orthopoxviruses, including variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. They contribute to virulence by suppressing IL-18-mediated immune responses. Here, we describe the 2.0-A resolution crystal structure of an orthopoxvirus IL-18BP, ectromelia virus IL-18BP (ectvIL-18BP), in complex with hIL-18. The hIL-18 structure in the complex shows significant conformational change at the binding interface compared with the structure of ligand-free hIL-18, indicating that the binding is mediated by an induced-fit mechanism. EctvIL-18BP adopts a canonical Ig fold and interacts via one edge of its beta-sandwich with 3 cavities on the hIL-18 surface through extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Most of the ectvIL-18BP residues that participate in these interactions are conserved in both human and viral homologs, explaining their functional equivalence despite limited sequence homology. EctvIL-18BP blocks a putative receptor-binding site on IL-18, thus preventing IL-18 from engaging its receptor. Our structure provides insights into how IL-18BPs modulate hIL-18 activity. The revealed binding interface provides the basis for rational design of inhibitors against orthopoxvirus IL-18BP (for treating orthopoxvirus infection) or hIL-18 (for treating certain inflammatory and autoimmune diseases)."
18297086,In situ observation of protein phosphorylation by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy.,"Although the biological significance of protein phosphorylation in cellular signaling is widely appreciated, methods to directly detect these post-translational modifications in situ are lacking. Here we introduce the application of high-resolution NMR spectroscopy for observing de novo protein phosphorylation in vitro and in Xenopus laevis egg extracts and whole live oocyte cells. We found that the stepwise modification of adjacent casein kinase 2 (CK2) substrate sites within the viral SV40 large T antigen regulatory region proceeded in a defined order and through intermediate substrate release. This kinase mechanism contrasts with a more intuitive mode of CK2 action in which the kinase would remain substrate bound to perform both modification reactions without intermediate substrate release. For cellular signaling pathways, the transient availability of partially modified CK2 substrates could exert important switch-like regulatory functions."
19651603,Structural basis for subversion of cellular control mechanisms by the adenoviral E1A oncoprotein.,"The adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein mediates cell transformation by deregulating host cellular processes and activating viral gene expression by recruitment of cellular proteins that include cyclic-AMP response element binding (CREB) binding protein (CBP)/p300 and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). While E1A is capable of independent interaction with CBP/p300 or pRb, simultaneous binding of both proteins is required for maximal biological activity. To obtain insights into the mechanism by which E1A hijacks the cellular transcription machinery by competing with essential transcription factors for binding to CBP/p300, we have determined the structure of the complex between the transcriptional adaptor zinc finger-2 (TAZ2) domain of CBP and the conserved region-1 (CR1) domain of E1A. The E1A CR1 domain is unstructured in the free state and upon binding folds into a local helical structure mediated by an extensive network of intermolecular hydrophobic contacts. By NMR titrations, we show that E1A efficiently competes with the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 for binding to TAZ2 and that pRb interacts with E1A at 2 independent sites located in CR1 and CR2. We show that pRb and the CBP TAZ2 domain can bind simultaneously to the CR1 site of E1A to form a ternary complex and propose a structural model for the pRb:E1A:CBP complex on the basis of published x-ray data for homologous binary complexes. These observations reveal the molecular basis by which E1A inhibits p53-mediated transcriptional activation and provide a rationale for the efficiency of cellular transformation by the adenoviral E1A oncoprotein."
19620963,Structural insights into host GTPase isoform selection by a family of bacterial GEF mimics.,"The Escherichia coli type III effector Map belongs to a large family of bacterial virulence factors that activate host Rho GTPase signaling pathways through an unknown molecular mechanism. Here we report direct evidence that Map functions as a potent and selective guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42. The 2.3-A structure of the Map-Cdc42 complex revealed that Map mimics the GEF strategy of the mammalian Dbl family but has a three-dimensional architecture that is nearly identical to the bacterial GEF Salmonella spp. SopE. A comparative analysis between human and bacterial GEFs revealed a previously uncharacterized pairing mechanism between Map and the variable beta2-3 interswitch region of Cdc42. We propose a GTPase selection model that is experimentally validated by the preferential activation Rac1 and RhoA by the Shigella spp. effectors IpgB1 and IpgB2, respectively. These results significantly expand the repertoire of bacterial GEF mimics and unify a GEF selection mechanism for host GTPase substrates."
18688256,Molecular mimicry between IL-33 and KSHV for attachment to chromatin through the H2A-H2B acidic pocket.,"Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an IL-1-like ligand for the ST2 receptor that stimulates the production of Th2-associated cytokines. Recently, we showed that IL-33 is a chromatin-associated factor in the nucleus of endothelial cells in vivo. Here, we report the identification of a short IL-33 chromatin-binding peptide that shares striking similarities with a motif found in Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus LANA (latency-associated nuclear antigen), which is responsible for the attachment of viral genomes to mitotic chromosomes. Similar to LANA, the IL-33 peptide docks into the acidic pocket formed by the H2A-H2B dimer at the nucleosomal surface and regulates chromatin compaction by promoting nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Taken together, our data provide important new insights into the nuclear roles of IL-33, and show a unique example of molecular mimicry of a chromatin-associated cytokine by a DNA tumour virus. In addition, the data provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of the existence of non-histone cellular factors that bind to the acidic pocket of the nucleosome."
19887642,HIV-1 Vif-mediated ubiquitination/degradation of APOBEC3G involves four critical lysine residues in its C-terminal domain.,"During coevolution with the host, HIV-1 developed the ability to hijack the cellular ubiquitin/proteasome degradation pathway to counteract the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G (A3G), a host cytidine deaminase that can block HIV-1 replication. Abrogation of A3G function involves the HIV-1 Vif protein, which binds A3G and serves as an adapter molecule to recruit A3G to a Cullin5-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Structure-guided mutagenesis of A3G focused on the 14 most surface-exposed Lys residues allowed us to identify four Lys residues (Lys-297, 301, 303, and 334) that are required for Vif-mediated A3G ubiquitination and degradation. Substitution of Arg for these residues confers Vif resistance and restores A3G's antiviral activity in the presence of Vif. In our model, the critical four Lys residues cluster at the C terminus, opposite to the known N-terminal Vif-interaction region in the protein. Thus, spatial constraints imposed by the E3 ligase complex may be an important determinant in Vif-dependent A3G ubiquitination."
19543288,Mode of VAMP substrate recognition and inhibition of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin F.,"Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) cleave neuronal proteins responsible for neurotransmitter release, causing the neuroparalytic disease botulism. BoNT serotypes B, D, F and G cleave and inactivate vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), each at a unique peptide bond. The specificity of BoNTs depends on the mode of substrate recognition. We have investigated the mechanism of substrate recognition of BoNT F by determining the crystal structures of its complex with two substrate-based inhibitors, VAMP 22-58/Gln58D-cysteine and 27-58/Gln58D-cysteine. The inhibitors bind to BoNT F in the canonical direction (as seen for BoNTs A and E substrates) but are positioned specifically via three major exosites away from the active site. The cysteine sulfur of the inhibitors interacts with the zinc and exists as sulfinic acid in the inhibitor VAMP 27-58/Gln58D-cysteine. Arg133 and Arg171, which form part of two separate exosites, are crucial for substrate binding and catalysis."
19744486,Distinct kinetics of (H/K/N)Ras glucosylation and Rac1 glucosylation catalysed by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin.,"Mono-glucosylation of (H/K/N)Ras by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) blocks critical survival signaling pathways, resulting in apoptotic cell death. One yet unsolved problem in studies on TcsL is the lack of a method allowing the specific detection of (H/K/N)Ras glucosylation. In this study, we identify the Ras(Mab 27H5) antibody as a glucosylation-sensitive antibody capable for the immunoblot detection of (H/K/N)Ras glucosylation in TcsL-treated cells. Alternative Ras antibodies including the K-Ras(Mab F234) antibody or the v-H-Ras(Mab Y13-159) antibody recognize Ras proteins regardless of glucosylation. (H/K)Ras are further shown to be more efficaciously glucosylated by TcsL than Rac1 in rat basophilic leukemia cells as well as in a cell-free system."
17023018,Amino acid substitutions that specifically impair the transcriptional activity of papillomavirus E2 affect binding to the long isoform of Brd4.,"The E2 protein of papillomaviruses binds to specific sites in the viral genome to regulate its transcription, replication and segregation in mitosis. Amino acid substitutions in the transactivation domain (TAD) of E2, of Arg37 and Ile73, have been shown previously to impair the transcriptional activity of the protein but not its ability to support viral DNA replication. To understand the biochemical basis of this defect, we have used the TADs of a low-risk (HPV11) and a high-risk (HPV31) human papillomavirus (HPV) as affinity ligands to capture proteins from whole cell extracts that can associate with these domains. The major TAD-binding protein was identified by mass spectrometry and western blotting as the long isoform of Brd4. Binding to Brd4 was also demonstrated for the E2 TADs of other papillomaviruses including cutaneous and animal types. For HPV11, HPV31 and CRPV E2, we found that binding to Brd4 is significantly reduced by substitutions of Arg37 and Ile73. Since these amino acids are located near each other in the 3-dimensional structure of the TAD, we suggest that they define a conserved surface involved in binding Brd4 to regulate viral gene transcription."
20153329,Reconstitution of the mitochondrial Hsp70 (mortalin)-p53 interaction using purified proteins--identification of additional interacting regions.,"Previous studies have shown that the mammalian mitochondrial 70 kDa heat-shock protein (mortalin) can also be detected in the cytosol. Cytosolic mortalin binds p53 and by doing so, prevents translocation of the tumor suppressor into the nucleus. In this study, we developed a novel binding assay, using purified proteins, for tracking the interaction between p53 and mortalin. Our results reveal that: (i) P53 binds to the peptide-binding site of mortalin which enhances the ability of the former to bind DNA. (ii) An additional previously unknown binding site for mortalin exists within the C-terminal domain of p53."
19843693,HPV E6 protein interacts physically and functionally with the cellular telomerase complex.,"Telomerase activation is critical for the immortalization of primary human keratinocytes by the high-risk HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins, and this activation is mediated in part by E6-induction of the hTERT promoter. E6 induces the hTERT promoter via interactions with the cellular ubiquitin ligase, E6AP, and with the c-Myc and NFX-1 proteins, which are resident on the promoter. In the current study we demonstrate that E6 protein interacts directly with the hTERT protein. Correlating with its ability to bind hTERT, E6 also associates with telomeric DNA and with endogenous active telomerase complexes. Most importantly, E6 increases the telomerase activity of human foreskin fibroblasts transduced with the hTERT gene, and this activity is independent of hTERT mRNA expression. Unlike its ability to degrade p53, E6 does not degrade hTERT protein in vitro or in vivo. Our studies of E6/hTERT interactions also reveal that the C-terminal tagged hTERT protein, although incapable of immortalizing fibroblasts, does immortalize keratinocytes in collaboration with the viral E7 protein. Thus, E6 protein mediates telomerase activation by a posttranscriptional mechanism and these findings provide a model for exploring the direct modulation of cell telomerase/telomere function by an oncogenic virus and suggest its potential role in both neoplasia and virus replication."
18636090,Viral targeting of DEAD box protein 3 reveals its role in TBK1/IKKepsilon-mediated IRF activation.,"Viruses are detected by different classes of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors and RIG-like helicases. Engagement of PRRs leads to activation of interferon (IFN)-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 through IKKepsilon and TBK1 and consequently IFN-beta induction. Vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes proteins that manipulate host signalling, sometimes by targeting uncharacterised proteins. Here, we describe a novel VACV protein, K7, which can inhibit PRR-induced IFN-beta induction by preventing TBK1/IKKepsilon-mediated IRF activation. We identified DEAD box protein 3 (DDX3) as a host target of K7. Expression of DDX3 enhanced Ifnb promoter induction by TBK1/IKKepsilon, whereas knockdown of DDX3 inhibited this, and virus- or dsRNA-induced IRF3 activation. Further, dominant-negative DDX3 inhibited virus-, dsRNA- and cytosolic DNA-stimulated Ccl5 promoter induction, which is also TBK1/IKKepsilon dependent. Both K7 binding and enhancement of Ifnb induction mapped to the N-terminus of DDX3. Furthermore, virus infection induced an association between DDX3 and IKKepsilon. Therefore, this study shows for the first time the involvement of a DEAD box helicase in TBK1/IKKepsilon-mediated IRF activation and Ifnb promoter induction."
19920174,Fusion of epithelial cells by Epstein-Barr virus proteins is triggered by binding of viral glycoproteins gHgL to integrins alphavbeta6 or alphavbeta8.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus that is causally implicated in the development of lymphoid and epithelial tumors. Entry of virus requires fusion of virus envelopes and cell membranes. Fusion with B lymphocytes requires virus glycoprotein gB and a 3-part complex of glycoproteins, gHgLgp42. It is triggered by interactions between glycoprotein 42 (gp42) and HLA class II. However, fusion with epithelial cells is impeded by gp42 and instead is triggered by interactions between an unknown epithelial protein and a 2-part complex of gHgL. We report here that gHgL binds with high affinity to epithelial cells and that affinity of binding is increased by 3 orders of magnitude in the presence of Mn(2+). Binding and infection can be reduced by fibronectin and vitronectin, by down-regulation of integrin alphav, or by a peptide corresponding to 13 aa of gH which include a KGDE motif. Fusion of cells expressing gB and gHgL can be blocked by vitronectin or triggered by addition of soluble truncated integrins alphavbeta6 and alphavbeta8. We conclude that the direct interaction between EBV gHgL and integrins alphavbeta6 and alphavbeta8 can provide the trigger for fusion of EBV with an epithelial cell."
19820695,Helicobacter pylori CagA activates NF-kappaB by targeting TAK1 for TRAF6-mediated Lys 63 ubiquitination.,"Helicobacter pylori-initiated chronic gastritis is characterized by the cag pathogenicity island-dependent upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, which is largely mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. However, the cag pathogenicity island-encoded proteins and cellular signalling molecules that are involved in H. pylori-induced NF-kappaB activation and inflammatory response remain unclear. Here, we show that H. pylori virulence factor CagA and host protein transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) are essential for H. pylori-induced activation of NF-kappaB. CagA physically associates with TAK1 and enhances its activity and TAK1-induced NF-kappaB activation through the tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6-mediated, Lys 63-linked ubiquitination of TAK1. These findings show that polyubiquitination of TAK1 regulates the activation of NF-kappaB, which in turn is used by H. pylori CagA for the H. pylori-induced inflammatory response."
20924359,Ubiquitination and deubiquitination of NP protein regulates influenza A virus RNA replication.,"Influenza A virus RNA replication requires an intricate regulatory network involving viral and cellular proteins. In this study, we examined the roles of cellular ubiquitinating/deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). We observed that downregulation of a cellular deubiquitinating enzyme USP11 resulted in enhanced virus production, suggesting that USP11 could inhibit influenza virus replication. Conversely, overexpression of USP11 specifically inhibited viral genomic RNA replication, and this inhibition required the deubiquitinase activity. Furthermore, we showed that USP11 interacted with PB2, PA, and NP of viral RNA replication complex, and that NP is a monoubiquitinated protein and can be deubiquitinated by USP11 in vivo. Finally, we identified K184 as the ubiquitination site on NP and this residue is crucial for virus RNA replication. We propose that ubiquitination/deubiquitination of NP can be manipulated for antiviral therapeutic purposes."
20553488,Post-translational modification of the deubiquitinating enzyme otubain 1 modulates active RhoA levels and susceptibility to Yersinia invasion.,"Microbial pathogens exploit the ubiquitin system to facilitate infection and manipulate the immune responses of the host. In this study, susceptibility to Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis invasion was found to be increased upon overexpression of the deubiquitinating enzyme otubain 1 (OTUB1), a member of the ovarian tumour domain-containing protein family. Conversely, OTUB1 knockdown interfered with Yersinia invasion in HEK293T cells as well as in primary monocytes. This effect was attributed to a modulation of bacterial uptake. We demonstrate that the Yersinia-encoded virulence factor YpkA (YopO) kinase interacts with a post-translationally modified form of OTUB1 that contains multiple phosphorylation sites. OTUB1, YpkA and the small GTPase ras homologue gene family member A (RhoA) were found to be part of the same protein complex, suggesting that RhoA levels are modulated by OTUB1. Our results show that OTUB1 is able to stabilize active RhoA prior to invasion, which is concomitant with an increase in bacterial uptake. This effect is modulated by post-translational modifications of OTUB1, suggesting a new entry point for manipulating Yersinia interactions with the host."
19322197,Termination of NF-kappaB activity through a gammaherpesvirus protein that assembles an EC5S ubiquitin-ligase.,"Host colonisation by lymphotropic gammaherpesviruses depends critically on the expansion of viral genomes in germinal centre (GC) B cells. Yet, host and virus molecular mechanisms involved in driving such proliferation remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the ORF73 protein encoded by the murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) inhibits host nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcriptional activity through poly-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal-dependent nuclear degradation of the NF-kappaB family member p65/RelA. The mechanism involves the assembly of an ElonginC/Cullin5/SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signalling)-like complex, mediated by an unconventional viral SOCS-box motif present in ORF73. Functional deletion of this SOCS-box motif ablated NF-kappaB inhibitory effect of ORF73, suppressed MuHV-4 expansion in GC B cells and prevented MuHV-4 persistent infection in mice. These findings demonstrate that viral inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in latently infected GC centroblasts is critical for the establishment of a gammaherpesvirus persistent infection, underscoring the physiological importance of proteasomal degradation of RelA/NF-kappaB as a regulatory mechanism of this signalling pathway."
16585770,EspF of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli binds sorting nexin 9.,"EspF of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli targets mitochondria and subverts a number of cellular functions. EspF consists of six putative Src homology 3 (SH3) domain binding motifs. In this study we identified sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) as a host cell EspF binding partner protein, which binds EspF via its amino-terminal SH3 region. Coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy showed specific EspF-SNX9 interaction and non-mitochondrial protein colocalization in infected epithelial cells."
18946490,RNA-dependent recruitment of the origin recognition complex.,"The origin recognition complex (ORC) has an important function in determining the initiation sites of DNA replication. In higher eukaryotes, ORC lacks sequence-specific DNA binding, and the mechanisms of ORC recruitment and origin determination are poorly understood. ORC is recruited with high efficiency to the Epstein-Barr virus origin of plasmid replication (OriP) through a complex mechanism involving interactions with the virus-encoded EBNA1 protein. We present evidence that ORC recruitment to OriP and DNA replication function depends on RGG-like motifs, referred to as LR1 and LR2, in the EBNA1 amino-terminal domain. Moreover, we show that LR1 and LR2 recruitment of ORC is RNA dependent. HMGA1a, which can functionally substitute for LR1 and LR2 domain, can also recruit ORC in an RNA-dependent manner. EBNA1 and HMGA1a RGG motifs bound to structured G-rich RNA, as did ORC1 peptides, which interact with EBNA1. RNase A treatment of cellular chromatin released a fraction of the total ORC, suggesting that ORC association with chromatin, and possibly cellular origins, is stabilized by RNA. We propose that structural RNA molecules mediate ORC recruitment at some cellular and viral origins, similar to OriP."
21527913,LMP1 association with CD63 in endosomes and secretion via exosomes limits constitutive NF-κB activation.,"The ubiquitous Epstein Barr virus (EBV) exploits human B-cell development to establish a persistent infection in ∼90% of the world population. Constitutive activation of NF-κB by the viral oncogene latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) has an important role in persistence, but is a risk factor for EBV-associated lymphomas. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous LMP1 escapes degradation upon accumulation within intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes and secretion via exosomes. LMP1 associates and traffics with the intracellular tetraspanin CD63 into vesicles that lack MHC II and sustain low cholesterol levels, even in 'cholesterol-trapping' conditions. The lipid-raft anchoring sequence FWLY, nor ubiquitylation of the N-terminus, controls LMP1 sorting into exosomes. Rather, C-terminal modifications that retain LMP1 in Golgi compartments preclude assembly within CD63-enriched domains and/or exosomal discharge leading to NF-κB overstimulation. Interference through shRNAs further proved the antagonizing role of CD63 in LMP1-mediated signalling. Thus, LMP1 exploits CD63-enriched microdomains to restrain downstream NF-κB activation by promoting trafficking in the endosomal-exosomal pathway. CD63 is thus a critical mediator of LMP1 function in- and outside-infected (tumour) cells."
19379743,BS69 negatively regulates the canonical NF-kappaB activation induced by Epstein-Barr virus-derived LMP1.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) activates NF-kappaB signaling pathways through the two C-terminal regions, CTAR1 and CTAR2. BS69 has previously been shown to be involved in LMP1-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation through CTAR2 by interacting with tumor necrosis factor (TNFR) receptor-associated factor 6. In the present study, our manipulation of BS69 expression clearly indicates that BS69 negatively regulates LMP1-mediated NF-kappaB activation and up-regulates IL-6 mRNA expression and IkappaB degradation. Our immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that BS69 decreases complex formation between LMP1 and TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD)."
16878151,Human papillomavirus type 16 E6 protein interacts with cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator-associated ligand and promotes E6-associated protein-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.,"The PDZ proteins such as hDLG, hScrib and MAGIs function as the membrane-associated protein scaffolds and have been shown to interact with the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6s. In this report, we identify a Golgi-associated PDZ protein, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator-associated ligand (CAL) as a cellular target of HPV16 E6 by the proteomic approach. The carboxy-terminal PDZ-binding motif of HPV16 E6 specifically interacts with the PDZ domain of CAL, and the interaction enhances proteasome-mediated degradation of CAL. HPV16 E6 interacts with CAL more strongly and degrades it better than HPV18 E6 owing to the more compatible PDZ-binding motif. CAL is ubiquitinated by the E6/E6-associated protein (E6AP) complex or by E6AP alone, albeit less efficiently, which indicates that it could be a normal target of E6AP. Although it downregulates CAL at the transcript level, small interfering RNA-induced depletion of HPV16 E6 in Caski cells stabilizes CAL at the protein level, suggesting that HPV16 E6 mediates the proteasomal degradation of CAL in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells. HPV16 E6 may tightly regulate the vesicular trafficking processes by interacting with CAL, and such a modification can contribute to the development of cervical cancer."
19008854,"Interferon-inducible protein, P56, inhibits HPV DNA replication by binding to the viral protein E1.","Type I interferon (IFN) inhibits, by an unknown mechanism, the replication of human papillomaviruses (HPV), which are major human pathogens, Here, we present evidence that P56 (a protein), the expression of which is strongly induced by IFN, double-stranded RNA and viruses, mediates the anti-HPV effect of IFN. Ectopic expression of P56 inhibited HPV DNA replication and its ablation in IFN-treated cells alleviated the inhibitory effect of IFN on HPV DNA replication. Protein-protein interaction and mutational analyses established that the antiviral effect of P56 was mediated by its direct interaction with the DNA replication origin-binding protein E1 of several strains of HPV, through the tetratricopeptide repeat 2 in the N-terminal region of P56 and the C-terminal region of E1. In vivo, the interaction with P56, a cytoplasmic protein, caused translocation of E1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In vitro, recombinant P56, or a small fragment derived from it, inhibited the DNA helicase activity of E1 and E1-mediated HPV DNA replication. These observations delineate the molecular mechanism of IFN's antiviral action against HPV."
9431994,Homologous regions of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) and the vaccinia virus K3L gene product interact with the same domain within the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR).,"The vaccinia virus K3L gene product, pK3, binds to the dsRNA-activated protein kinase, PKR, reducing its ability to interact with and phosphorylate eIF2alpha. On the basis of this characteristic and the homology of pK3 to the N-terminus of eIF2alpha, several laboratories have utilized pK3 to investigate the molecular determinants that specify substrate recognition by PKR. The data presented here demonstrate that the natural substrate, eIF2alpha, also binds to PKR in vitro and interacts with the same or an overlapping domain within PKR. A truncated form of eIF2alpha, representing the N-terminal 123 amino acids and containing the regions of homology to pK3, retains the ability to bind PKR. pK3, eIF2alpha, and the truncated form of eIF2alpha all bind to the C-terminus of PKR containing the catalytic domain, but not to the regulatory N-terminus. Variants of pK3 and eIF2alpha, des-(75-78)-K3L (pK3deltaGYID), and des-(80-83)-eIF2alpha (eIF2alphadeltaGYID), from which the conserved amino acids GYID have been deleted, exhibit a decreased ability to interact with PKR. Similarly, the in vitro binding of pK3, eIF2alpha, and the truncated form of eIF2alpha to PKR can be competed with purified pK3 but not with pK3deltaGYID. In addition, the deletion of GYID from eIF2alpha significantly reduces its ability to be phosphorylated by PKR, demonstrating that PKR recognizes its substrate, at least in part through interaction with sequences remote from the phosphorylation site. In summary, we have shown that the region within PKR that interacts with the pseudosubstrate, pK3, is the same region that interacts with the authentic substrate, eIF2alpha. In addition, we have shown that the N-terminal 123 amino acids of eIF2alpha contains structural elements necessary for recognition by PKR. The results pinpoint the GYID motif, shared between pK3 and eIF2alpha and distant from the phosphorylation site, as being important for the interaction of eIF2alpha with PKR, as well as its phosphorylation."
18604270,Vaccinia virus E3 protein prevents the antiviral action of ISG15.,"The ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15 is one of the most predominant proteins induced by type I interferons (IFN). In this study, murine embryo fibroblast (MEFs) and mice lacking the gene were used to demonstrate a novel role of ISG15 as a host defense molecule against vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. In MEFs, the growth of replication competent Western Reserve (WR) VACV strain was affected by the absence of ISG15, but in addition, virus lacking E3 protein (VVDeltaE3L) that is unable to grow in ISG15+/+ cells replicated in ISG15-deficient cells. Inhibiting ISG15 with siRNA or promoting its expression in ISG15-/- cells with a lentivirus vector showed that VACV replication was controlled by ISG15. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that E3 binds ISG15 through its C-terminal domain. The VACV antiviral action of ISG15 and its interaction with E3 are events independent of PKR (double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase). In mice lacking ISG15, infection with VVDeltaE3L caused significant disease and mortality, an effect not observed in VVDeltaE3L-infected ISG15+/+ mice. Pathogenesis in ISG15-deficient mice infected with VVDeltaE3L or with an E3L deletion mutant virus lacking the C-terminal domain triggered an enhanced inflammatory response in the lungs compared with ISG15+/+-infected mice. These findings showed an anti-VACV function of ISG15, with the virus E3 protein suppressing the action of the ISG15 antiviral factor."
18059340,Interaction with PI3-kinase contributes to the cytotoxic activity of apoptin.,"Apoptin, a small protein from the chicken anemia virus, has attracted attention because of its specificity in killing tumor cells. Localization of apoptin in the nucleus of tumor cells has been shown to be vital for proapoptotic activity, however, targeted expression of apoptin in the nucleus of normal cells does not harm the cells, indicating that nuclear localization of apoptin is insufficient for its cytotoxicity. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that apoptin interacts with the SH3 domain of p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K), through its proline-rich region. Apoptin derivatives devoid of this proline-rich region do not interact with p85, are unable to activate PI3-K, and show impaired apoptosis induction. Moreover, apoptin mutants containing the proline-rich domain are sufficient to elevate PI3-K activity and to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Downregulation of p85 leads to nuclear exclusion of apoptin and impairs cell death induction, indicating that interaction with the p85 PI3-K subunit essentially contributes to the cytotoxic activity of apoptin."
17485524,Functional and structural studies of the vaccinia virus virulence factor N1 reveal a Bcl-2-like anti-apoptotic protein.,"Vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes many immunomodulatory proteins, including inhibitors of apoptosis and modulators of innate immune signalling. VACV protein N1 is an intracellular homodimer that contributes to virus virulence and was reported to inhibit nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signalling. However, analysis of NF-kappaB signalling in cells infected with recombinant viruses with or without the N1L gene showed no difference in NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression. Given that N1 promotes virus virulence, other possible functions of N1 were investigated and this revealed that N1 is an inhibitor of apoptosis in cells transfected with the N1L gene and in the context of VACV infection. In support of this finding virally expressed N1 co-precipitated with endogenous pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bid, Bad and Bax as well as with Bad and Bax expressed by transfection. In addition, the crystal structure of N1 was solved to 2.9 A resolution (0.29 nm). Remarkably, although N1 shows no sequence similarity to cellular proteins, its three-dimensional structure closely resembles Bcl-x(L) and other members of the Bcl-2 protein family. The structure also reveals that N1 has a constitutively open surface groove similar to the grooves of other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, which bind the BH3 motifs of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Molecular modelling of BH3 peptides into the N1 surface groove, together with analysis of their physico-chemical properties, suggests a mechanism for the specificity of peptide recognition. This study illustrates the importance of the evolutionary conservation of structure, rather than sequence, in protein function and reveals a novel anti-apoptotic protein from orthopoxviruses."
19237563,Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein EBNA3C residues critical for maintaining lymphoblastoid cell growth.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is essential for efficient conversion of primary human B lymphocytes to lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and for continued LCL growth. We used a transcomplementation assay in the context of LCLs transformed by an EBV with a conditional EBNA3C to identify the EBNA3C amino acids (aa) necessary for maintaining LCL growth. Surprisingly, we found that most EBNA3C aa were essential for continued LCL growth. Only EBNA3C mutants deleted for residues within aa 507-515, 516-620, 637-675, or 676-727 maintained full LCL growth, and EBNA3C mutants deleted for residues within aa 728-732 or 910-992 maintained slow LCL growth. In contrast, EBNA3C lacking aa 180-231, which mediate RBP-Jkappa association and are necessary for EBNA3C abrogation of EBNA2-induced transcription through RBP-Jkappa, could not support LCL growth. Furthermore, 2 EBNA3C alanine substitution mutants within aa 180-231, which were wild-type (wt) in abrogating EBNA2-mediated transcription through RBP-Jkappa, maintained LCL growth, and 2 alanine substitution mutants within aa 180-231, which were null in abrogating EBNA2-mediated transcription through RBP-Jkappa, did not maintain LCL growth. This indicates that EBNA3C regulation of transcription through RBP-Jkappa is critical to maintaining LCL growth. Several other EBNA3C functions also are critical for LCL growth, because EBNA3C mutants deleted for residues within aa 130-159, 251-506, or 733-909 were wt in abrogating transcription through RBP-Jkappa and expression level, but did not maintain LCL growth."
19017798,"IRF7 activation by Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 requires localization at activation sites and TRAF6, but not TRAF2 or TRAF3.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent infection membrane protein 1 (LMP1), a constitutively aggregated and activated pseudoreceptor, activates IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) through RIP1. We now report that the LMP1 cytoplasmic carboxyl terminal amino acids 379-386 bound IRF7 and activated IRF7. IRF7 activation required TRAF6 and RIP1, but not TRAF2 or TRAF3. LMP1 Y(384)YD(386), which are required for TRADD and RIP1 binding and for NF-kappaB activation, were not required for IRF7 binding, but were required for IRF7 activation, implicating signaling through TRADD and RIP1 in IRF7 activation. Association with active LMP1 signaling complexes was also critical for IRF7 activation because (i) a dominant-negative IRF7 bound to LMP1, blocked IRF7 association and activation, but did not inhibit LMP1 induced NF-kappaB or TBK1 or Sendai virus-mediated IFN stimulated response element activation; and (ii) two different LMP1 transmembrane domain mutants, which fail to aggregate, each bound IRF7 and prevented LMP1 from binding and activating IRF7 in the same cell, but did not prevent NF-kappaB activation. Thus, efficient IRF7 activation required association with LMP1 CTAR2 in proximity to LMP1 CTAR2 mediated kinase activation sites."
19590578,DAI/ZBP1 recruits RIP1 and RIP3 through RIP homotypic interaction motifs to activate NF-kappaB.,"Detection of viral nucleic acids is central to antiviral immunity. Recently, DAI/ZBP1 (DNA-dependent activator of IRFs/Z-DNA binding protein 1) was identified as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor and shown to activate the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcription factors, leading to type-I interferon production. DAI-induced IRF activation depends on TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), whereas signalling pathways and molecular components involved in NF-kappaB activation remain elusive. Here, we report the identification of two receptor-interacting protein (RIP) homotypic interaction motifs (RHIMs) in the DAI protein sequence, and show that these domains relay DAI-induced NF-kappaB signals through the recruitment of the RHIM-containing kinases RIP1 and RIP3. We show that knockdown of not only RIP1, but also RIP3 affects DAI-induced NF-kappaB activation. Importantly, RIP recruitment to DAI is inhibited by the RHIM-containing murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) protein M45. These findings delineate the DAI signalling pathway to NF-kappaB and suggest a possible new immune modulation strategy of the MCMV."
20300064,A bacterial effector targets host DH-PH domain RhoGEFs and antagonizes macrophage phagocytosis.,"Bacterial pathogens often harbour a type III secretion system (TTSS) that injects effector proteins into eukaryotic cells to manipulate host processes and cause diseases. Identification of host targets of bacterial effectors and revealing their mechanism of actions are crucial for understating bacterial virulence. We show that EspH, a type III effector conserved in enteric bacterial pathogens including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli and Citrobacter rodentium, markedly disrupts actin cytoskeleton structure and induces cell rounding up when ectopically expressed or delivered into HeLa cells by the bacterial TTSS. EspH inactivates host Rho GTPase signalling pathway at the level of RhoGEF. EspH directly binds the DH-PH domain in multiple RhoGEFs, which prevents their binding to Rho and thereby inhibits nucleotide exchange-mediated Rho activation. Consistently, infection of mouse macrophages with EPEC harbouring EspH attenuates phagocytosis of the bacteria as well as FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis. EspH represents the first example of targeting RhoGEFs by bacterial effectors, and our results also reveal an unprecedented mechanism used by enteric pathogens to counteract the host defence system."
20138174,BS69 cooperates with TRAF3 in the regulation of Epstein-Barr virus-derived LMP1/CTAR1-induced NF-kappaB activation.,"Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) activates NF-kappaB signaling pathways through two C-terminal regions, CTAR1 and CTAR2. Previous studies have demonstrated that BS69, a multidomain cellular protein, regulates LMP1/CTAR2-mediated NF-kappaB activation by interfering with the complex formation between TRADD and LMP1/CTAR2. Here, we found that BS69 directly interacted with the LMP1/CTAR1 domain and regulated LMP1/CTAR1-mediated NF-kappaB activation and subsequent IL-6 production. Regarding the mechanisms involved, we found that BS69 directly interacted with TRAF3, a negative regulator of NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown experiments revealed that TRAF3 was involved in the BS69-mediated suppression of LMP1/CTAR1-induced NF-kappaB activation."
16051843,Tyrosine phosphorylation of the Tio oncoprotein is essential for transformation of primary human T cells.,"Human T cells are transformed to antigen-independent permanent growth in vitro upon infection with herpesvirus saimiri subgroup C strains. The viral oncoproteins required for this process, StpC and Tip, could be replaced by Tio, the oncoprotein of herpesvirus ateles. Here we demonstrate that proliferation of lymphocytes transformed with Tio-recombinant herpesvirus saimiri required the activity of Src family kinases. Src kinases had previously been identified as interaction partners of Tio. This interaction was now shown to be independent of any of the four tyrosine residues of Tio but to be dependent on an SH3-binding motif. Mutations within this motif abrogated the transforming capabilities of Tio-recombinant herpesvirus saimiri. Furthermore, kinase interaction resulted in the phosphorylation of Tio on a single tyrosine residue at position 136. Mutation of this residue in the viral context revealed that this phosphorylation site, but none of the other tyrosine residues, was required for T-cell transformation. These data indicate that the interaction of Tio with a Src kinase is essential for both the initiation and the maintenance of T-cell transformation by recombinant herpesvirus saimiri. The requirement for the tyrosine phosphorylation site at position 136 suggests a role for Tio beyond simple deregulation of the kinase."
12730668,Modulation of p120E4F transcriptional activity by the Gam1 adenoviral early protein.,"Gam1, an early adenoviral CELO protein, is required for viral replication. Consistent with its ability to inhibit histone deacetylation by HDAC1, Gam1 activates transcription. In this report, we identify the cellular transcription factor p120(E4F) as a Gam1 interaction partner. p120(E4F) is a low-abundance transcription factor that represses the adenovirus E4 promoter. Here we demonstrate that p120(E4F) interacts with HDAC1 in vivo and in vitro, and that E4F-mediated transcriptional repression is alleviated by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A or by overexpressing Gam1. A mutant E4 promoter unresponsive to E4F-mediated transcriptional repression is also not stimulated by Gam1. Moreover, our cofractionation experiments demonstrate that p120(E4F), HDAC1 and Gam1 may be concomitantly present in protein complexes. We conclude that Gam1 activates E4-dependent transcription possibly by inactivating HDAC1."
16155203,Structural characterization of Lyn-SH3 domain in complex with a herpesviral protein reveals an extended recognition motif that enhances binding affinity.,"The Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of the Src family kinase Lyn binds to the herpesviral tyrosine kinase interacting protein (Tip) more than one order of magnitude stronger than other closely related members of the Src family. In order to identify the molecular basis for high-affinity binding, the structure of free and Tip-bound Lyn-SH3 was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Tip forms additional contacts outside its classical proline-rich recognition motif and, in particular, a strictly conserved leucine (L186) of the C-terminally adjacent sequence stretch packs into a hydrophobic pocket on the Lyn surface. Although the existence of this pocket is no unique property of Lyn-SH3, Lyn is the only Src family kinase that contains an additional aromatic residue (H41) in the n-Src loop as part of this pocket. H41 covers L186 of Tip by forming tight hydrophobic contacts, and model calculations suggest that the increase in binding affinity compared with other SH3 domains can mainly be attributed to these additional interactions. These findings indicate that this pocket can mediate specificity even between otherwise closely related SH3 domains."
20214683,"The competitor-introduced Ggamma recruitment system, a new approach for screening affinity-enhanced proteins.","We have developed a new approach based on the Ggamma recruitment system to screen affinity-enhanced proteins by expressing a binding competitor. The previously established Ggamma recruitment system is a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system that utilizes G-protein signaling, and is based on the fact that membrane localization of the G-protein gamma subunit (Ggamma) is essential for signal transduction in yeast. In the original Y2H system, an engineered Ggamma that lacks membrane localization upon deletion of the lipid modification site (Ggamma(cyto)) is produced, and a candidate protein with an artificial lipidation site and its counterpart fused with Ggamma(cyto) are expressed. As protein-protein interactions bring Ggamma(cyto) towards the plasma membrane, G-protein signaling can be activated, and the interaction is detected by various cellular responses as the readout. In the current study, we expressed a third cytosolic protein that competes with the candidate protein to specifically isolate affinity-enhanced mutants from a mutation library of the candidate protein. Enhancing the affinity of the protein candidate guides the counterpart-Ggamma(cyto) fusion protein towards the plasma membrane and activates signaling. Using mutants of the Z domain derived from Staphylococcus aureus protein A as candidate proteins or competitors, and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) as the counterpart, we demonstrate that affinity-enhanced proteins can be effectively screened from a library containing a 10 000-fold excess of non-enhanced proteins. This new approach, called the competitor-introduced Ggamma recruitment system, will be useful for efficient discovery of rare valuable candidates hidden among excess ordinary ones."
14732683,Simian virus 40 large T antigen targets the spindle assembly checkpoint protein Bub1.,"The mitotic spindle checkpoint protein Bub1 has been found to be mutated at low frequency in certain human cancers characterized by aneuploidy. Simian virus 40 large T antigen efficiently immortalizes rodent cells and occasionally transforms them to tumorigenicity. T antigen can also cause genomic instability, inducing chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy. Here, we report an interaction between Bub1 and T antigen. T antigen coimmunoprecipitates with endogenous Bub1 and Bub3, another component of the spindle checkpoint complex. Genetic analysis demonstrates that the interaction of T antigen with Bub1 is not required for immortalization but is closely correlated with transformation. T antigen induces an override of the spindle checkpoint dependent on Bub1 binding. This interaction with proteins of the spindle checkpoint machinery suggests another role for T antigen and provides insight into its ability to cause chromosomal aberrations, aneuploidy, and transformation."
10049825,Differences in the interactions of oncogenic adenovirus 12 early region 1A and nononcogenic adenovirus 2 early region 1A with the cellular coactivators p300 and CBP.,"Association with the cellular coactivators p300 and CBP is required for the growth-regulatory function of adenoviral (Ad) early region 1A (E1A) proteins. E1A regions necessary for these interactions overlap with domains involved in the induction of tumours in immunocompetent rodents through highly oncogenic Ad12. Differences in the association of cellular factors with the respective E1A domains of Ad12 and nononcogenic Ad2 might therefore be involved in serotype-specific oncogenicity. We analyzed the interaction of the Ad12 E1A 235R protein with p300 and CBP. Here we demonstrate that in the case of Ad12, but not Ad2/5, amino acids (aa) 1-29 of E1A proteins are sufficient to bind the p300-C/H3 domain in vivo and wild-type p300 in vitro. The conserved arginine-2, which is essential for the interaction between Ad2 E1A and p300, was dispensable for the Ad12 E1A 235R-p300 interaction in vitro. In addition to the p300-C/H3 region, we identified a second domain within p300 (aa 1999-2200) binding to the 235R protein. Contrary to p300, the amino-terminus and CR1 are necessary to associate with CBP. The aa 1-29 of the 235R protein but not CR1 are essential for the repression of colTRE-driven gene expression. This repression function is strictly dependent on p300 but not on CBP."
7853498,Adenovirus E1A proteins interact with the cellular YY1 transcription factor.,"The adenovirus 12S and 13S E1A proteins have been shown to relieve repression mediated by the cellular transcription factor YY1. The 13S E1A protein not only relieves repression but also activates transcription through YY1 binding sites. In this study, using a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays, we demonstrate that both E1A proteins can bind to YY1, although the 13S E1A protein binds more efficiently than the 12S E1A protein. Two domains on the E1A proteins interact with YY1: an amino-terminal sequence (residues 15 to 35) that is present in both E1A proteins and a domain that includes at least a portion of conserved region 3 (residues 140 to 188) that is present in the 13S but not the 12S E1A protein. Two domains on YY1 interact with E1A proteins: one is contained within residues 54 to 260, and the other is contained within the carboxy-terminal domain of YY1 (residues 332 to 414). Cotransfection of a plasmid expressing carboxy-terminal amino acids 332 to 414 of YY1 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain can inhibit expression from a reporter construct with GAL4 DNA binding sites in its promoter, and inclusion of a third plasmid expressing E1A proteins can relieve the repression. Thus, we find a correlation between the ability of E1A to interact with the carboxy-terminal domain of YY1 and its ability to relieve repression caused by the carboxy-terminal domain of YY1. We propose that E1A proteins normally relieve YY1-mediated transcriptional repression by binding directly to the cellular transcription factor."
17348035,Human papillomavirus-16 E7 interacts with Siva-1 and modulates apoptosis in HaCaT human immortalized keratinocytes.,"The viral factor E7 plays a key role in the well-established association between ""high-risk"" Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the development of epithelial malignant tumors, as uterine cervix and ano-genital cancer. To delve into the molecular mechanisms of HPV-mediated cell transformation, we searched for novel potential cellular targets of the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein, by means of the yeast two-hybrid technique, identifying a protein-protein interaction between HPV-16 E7 and the pro-apoptotic cellular factor Siva-1. Using co-precipitation assays and the ""PepSets"" technique, we confirmed this physical interaction and mapped accurately, for both proteins, the amino acid residues involved. Additionally, we found that HPV-16 E7 competed in vitro with the binding of the Bcl-X(L) anti-apoptotic factor to Siva-1, an interaction that has a major inference in UV radiation-induced apoptosis. In HaCaT immortalized human keratinocytes, forced HPV-16 E7 expression by retroviral infection caused Siva-1 transcript up-regulation, detected by cDNA macroarray hybridization and real-time quantitative PCR, paralleled by an increased amount of protein. Confirming the anti-apoptotic role of HPV-16 E7 in the HaCaT cellular model, evaluated by nuclear morphology, we also found that Siva-1 expression produced a significant increase of the apoptotic rate in UV radiation-exposed HaCaT cells, and that this effect resulted explicitly counteracted by HPV-16 E7. Being apoptosis a key physiological process for the elimination of irreversibly injured cells, the anti-apoptotic role of HPV-16 E7, performed at least by its interference with Siva-1, can be considered an additional mechanism for the survival of damaged, potentially transforming, cell clones."
17070091,HPV-18 E7 conjugates to c-Myc and mediates its transcriptional activity.,"Several reports in the literature have indicated that the E6 not only elevates the level of c-Myc level but that the protein also associates with the Myc complex and activates Myc-responsive genes. There would seem to be a mechanism by which this oncogene can modulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, an increase in c-Myc levels has also observed during ectopic expression of HPV E7 alone. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we further found that the c-Myc interacts and forms a specific complex with HPV-16E7. In this study, we have demonstrated that E7 does indeed interact with c-Myc and a sequential deletion analysis of E7 maps the c-Myc interaction site to the carboxyl-terminal region. We determined two HPV-18 E7 binding sites on c-Myc involving the amino acids regions 1-100 and 367-439. The interaction of the high-risk type HPV E7 with c-Myc can augment c-Myc transactivation activity but this does not occur with low-risk type HPV E7. Deletion within the Cys-X-X-Cys repeat motif at the C-terminus of HPV-18 E7 leads to a lost of association with c-Myc and also abolishes the enhancement of c-Myc's transactivation activity. Furthermore, the interaction of HPV-18 E7 with c-Myc functionally promotes c-Myc's DNA-binding ability. Using the hTERT promoter as a model, enhanced c-Myc binding ability to the hTERT promoter as measured by immunoprecipitation assay was observed and occurred in an E7 dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results provide significant new insights into the association of c-Myc with E7 and the possible involvement of high-risk E7 in oncogenesis."
17023019,Association of E6AP (UBE3A) with human papillomavirus type 11 E6 protein.,"The cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP (UBE3A) interacts with the cancer-associated HPV E6 oncoproteins, where together with the viral E6 oncoprotein it binds and targets the degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor. We find that the HPV-11E6 protein also associates with E6AP in vivo, and thereby can target the degradation of an E6-associated protein. Mutation of an E6-binding LXXLL peptide motif on E6AP eliminated the association, revealing a common mode of interaction between high- and low-risk E6 proteins and E6AP. E6AP was required for the in vivo degradation of DLG1 by both HVP-18 E6 and a chimeric HPV-11E6. The common functional interaction of both cancer-associated and non-cancer-associated E6 proteins with E6AP establishes a common mechanism for E6 proteins trophic to mucosal squamous epithelium."
9311810,Herpes simplex virus 1 alpha regulatory protein ICP0 interacts with and stabilizes the cell cycle regulator cyclin D3.,"The herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infected-cell protein 0 (ICP0) has the characteristics of a promiscuous transactivator of genes introduced into cells by infection or transfection. To identify cellular proteins interacting with ICP0, we used a domain of exon II of ICP0 that is known to be crucial for regulatory function of the protein as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen. Our results were as follows. (i) A cDNA in a positive yeast colony was found to encode cyclin D3, a cell cycle regulator of G1 phase. (ii) A purified chimeric protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to cyclin D3 specifically formed complexes with ICP0 contained in HSV-1-infected cell lysate. (iii) To enhance the expression of cyclin D3, the gene was inserted into the viral genome and overexpressed in infected cells. The overexpressed cyclin D3 colocalized with ICP0 in nuclear structures characteristic of ND10 and which earlier have been reported to contain ICP0. (iv) The accumulation of cyclin D3 protein in Vero cells infected with an alpha0 deletion mutant was reduced relative to that of cells infected with wild-type virus or a recombinant virus in which the deleted alpha0 sequences were restored. (v) Lysates of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells doubly infected with baculoviruses genetically engineered to express cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) phosphorylated GST fused to retinoblastoma protein (GST-pRb) but did not phosphorylate the GST-alpha0(20-241) or GST-alpha0(543-768) fusion protein or immunoprecipitated ICP0 proteins. Moreover, the chimeric GST-ICP0(exon II) protein shown to bind cyclin D3 had no effect on the activity of the kinase on GST-pRb when added to mixtures of lysates of Sf9 cells which coexpressed cyclin D3 and CDK4. These results indicate that ICP0 interacts with, colocalizes with, and stabilizes the cyclin D3 cell cycle regulator and does not affect its interaction with the cyclin-dependent kinase."
10873756,Identification of domains of the HPV11 E1 protein required for DNA replication in vitro.,"The HPV E1 and E2 proteins along with cellular factors, are required for replication of the viral genome. In this study we show that in vitro synthesized HPV11 E1 can support DNA replication in a cell-free system and is able to cooperate with E2 to recruit the host polymerase alpha primase to the HPV origin in vitro. Deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal 166 amino acids of E1, which encompass a nuclear localization signal and a cyclin E-binding motif, are dispensable for E1-dependent DNA replication and for recruitment of pol alpha primase to the origin in vitro. A shorter E1 protein lacking the N-terminal 190 amino acids supported cell-free DNA replication at less than 25% the efficiency of wild-type E1 and was active in the pol alpha primase recruitment assay. An even shorter E1 protein lacking a functional DNA-binding domain due to a truncation of the N-terminal 352 amino acids was inactive in both assays despite the fact that it retains the ability to associate with E2 or pol alpha primase in the absence of ori DNA. We provide additional functional evidence that E1 interacts with pol alpha primase through the p70 subunit of the complex by showing that p70 can be recruited to the HPV origin by E1 and E2 in vitro, that the domain of E1 (amino acids 353-649) that binds to pol alpha primase in vitro is the same as that needed for interaction with p70 in the yeast two-hybrid system, and that exogenously added p70 competes with the interaction between E1 and pol alpha primase and inhibits E1-dependent cell-free DNA replication. On the basis of these results and the observation that pol alpha primase competes with the interaction between E1 and E2 in solution, we propose that these three proteins assemble at the origin in a stepwise process during which E1, following its interaction with E2, must bind to DNA prior to interacting with pol alpha primase."
16227264,"Simian virus 5 V protein acts as an adaptor, linking DDB1 to STAT2, to facilitate the ubiquitination of STAT1.","The V protein of simian virus 5 (SV5) facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of STAT1. Here we show, by visualizing direct protein-protein interactions and by using the yeast two-hybrid system, that while the SV5 V protein fails to bind to STAT1 directly, it binds directly and independently to both DDB1 and STAT2, two cellular proteins known to be essential for SV5-mediated degradation of STAT1. We also demonstrate that STAT1 and STAT2 interact independently of SV5 V and show that SV5 V protein acts as an adaptor molecule linking DDB1 to STAT2/STAT1 heterodimers, which in the presence of additional accessory cellular proteins, including Cullin 4a, can ubiquitinate STAT1. Additionally, we show that the avidity of STAT2 for V is relatively weak but is significantly enhanced by the presence of both STAT1 and DDB1, i.e., the complex of STAT1, STAT2, DDB1, and SV5 V is more stable than a complex of STAT2 and V. From these studies we propose a dynamic model in which SV5 V acts as a bridge, bringing together a DDB1/Cullin 4a-containing ubiquitin ligase complex and STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers, which leads to the degradation of STAT1. The loss of STAT1 results in a decrease in affinity of binding of STAT2 for V such that STAT2 either dissociates from V or is displaced from V by STAT1/STAT2 complexes, thereby ensuring the cycling of the DDB1 and SV5 V containing E3 complex for continued rounds of STAT1 ubiquitination and degradation."
15518812,Protein interactions among the vaccinia virus late transcription factors.,"The viral proteins A1L, A2L, G8R, and H5R positively modulate vaccinia virus late gene expression. Host-encoded proteins hnRNP A2 and RBM3 may also interact with these viral factors to influence late gene expression. In these studies, a yeast two-hybrid screen and in vitro pulldown and crosslinking experiments were used to investigate protein--protein interactions among these factors. These studies confirmed a previous observation that G8R interacts with itself and A1L. However, self-interactions of A1L and H5R, and interactions between A2L and G8R, A2L and H5R, and H5R and G8R were also observed. In addition, the proteins hnRNP A2 and RBM3 both showed some interaction with A2L. Illustration of these interactions is a step toward understanding the architecture of the late gene transcription complex as it occurs in poxviruses."
9050995,Identification of p53 unbound to T-antigen in human cells transformed by simian virus 40 T-antigen.,"In several clones of SV40-transformed human cells, we investigated the relative amounts of large T-Antigen (T-Ag) and p53 proteins, both unbound and associated within complexes, with the goal of identifying changes associated with transformation and immortalization. Cells were transformed by wild type (wt) T-Ag, a functionally temperature sensitive T-Ag (tsA58) and other T-Ag variants. Western analysis showed that while most of the T-Ag was ultimately bound by p53, most of the p53 remained unbound to T-Ag. Unbound p53 remained in the supernatant after a T-Ag immunoprecipitation and p53 was present in two to fourfold excess of T-Ag. In one transformant there was five to tenfold more p53 than T-Ag. p53 was present in transformants in amounts at least 200-fold greater than in untransformed human cells. In wt and variant T-Ag transformants, including those generated with tsA58 T-Ag, large amounts of unbound p53 were present in both pre-crisis and immortal cells and when the cells were grown at permissive or non-permissive temperatures. We also found that in transformants produced by tsA58, an SV40/JCV chimeric T-Ag and other variants, T-Ag appeared to form a complex with p53 slowly perhaps because one or both proteins matured slowly. The presence in transformed human cells of large amounts of unbound p53 and in excess of T-Ag suggests that sequestration of p53 by T-Ag, resulting from complex formation, is required neither for morphological transformation nor immortalization of human cells. Rather, these results support the proposal that high levels of p53, the T-Ag/p53 complexes, or other biochemical event(s), lead to transformation and immortalization of human cells by T-Ag."
2138977,The regions of the retinoblastoma protein needed for binding to adenovirus E1A or SV40 large T antigen are common sites for mutations.,"The protein product of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene is thought to function in a pathway that restricts cell proliferation. Recently, transforming proteins from three different classes of DNA tumor viruses have been shown to form complexes with the RB protein. Genetic studies suggest that these interactions with the RB protein are important steps in transformation by these viruses. In order to understand better the function of the RB-viral oncoprotein complexes, we have mapped the regions of the RB protein that are necessary for these associations. Two non-contiguous regions of RB were found to be essential for complex formation with adenovirus E1A or SV40 large T antigen. These two regions are found between amino acids 393 and 572 and 646 and 772. Interestingly, these binding sites on RB overlap with the positions of naturally occurring, inactivating mutations of the RB gene. These results strongly suggest that these viral oncoproteins are targeting a protein domain that is an important site in the normal function of the RB protein."
2162480,Definition of the minimal simian virus 40 large T antigen- and adenovirus E1A-binding domain in the retinoblastoma gene product.,"It has previously been demonstrated that the simian virus 40 large T antigen and adenovirus E1A proteins can form complexes with the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (RB). We studied the ability of these proteins to bind to mutant RB proteins in vitro. A region of RB spanning residues 379 to 792 was found to be both necessary and sufficient for binding to T or E1A. Furthermore, this region of RB contains sufficient structural information to mimic wild-type RB in its ability to distinguish between wild-type T and the transformation-defective T mutant K1. The results of competition experiments with peptide analogs of the RB-binding sequence in T suggest that this region of RB makes direct contact with a short colinear region of T, i.e., residues 102 to 115, previously implicated in both transformation and RB binding."
2189724,Two distinct and frequently mutated regions of retinoblastoma protein are required for binding to SV40 T antigen.,"The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB) encodes a phosphoprotein of 110 kd (pp110RB) that forms specific complexes with SV40 T antigen and the transforming proteins of several other DNA tumor viruses. Interaction with RB is thought to contribute to transformation by these viruses as demonstrated by genetic analyses. To help understand the function of these interactions, the regions of RB that are involved in binding to T have been mapped. An in vitro protein synthesis system capable of producing full-length RB protein has been developed to facilitate the mapping study. A 5- to 10-fold increase in translational efficiency in the reticulocyte lysate was obtained when the 5' non-coding region of RB mRNA was replaced with that of beta-globin mRNA or a plant viral RNA, alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) RNA4. A series of mutated RB polypeptides produced from this system were assayed for T binding. Two non-contiguous regions of the RB protein, amino acid residues 394-571 and 649-773, were found to be necessary for binding to T: mutations in either region abolished T-RB complex formation. These results are consistent with the finding that, in all the cases analyzed so far, mutated RB proteins in human tumor cells also failed to bind to T antigen due to deletions including at least one of the two required regions. Thus the regions of RB defined in vitro as necessary for interaction with T might be physiologically relevant as well, and might play a fundamental role in normal RB protein function."
8411358,Simian virus 40 large T antigen associates with cyclin A and p33cdk2.,"In this paper we provide evidence that a fraction of large T antigen of simian virus 40 (SV40) interacts with cyclin A and p33cdk2 in both virus-infected and stably transformed cells. Immunoprecipitates of SV40 large T antigen from SV40-infected or SV40 large-T-antigen-transformed cells contain cyclin A, p33cdk2, and histone H1 kinase activity. Conversely, immunoprecipitates of cyclin A from these cells contain SV40 large T antigen. In this respect, SV40 large T antigen has properties similar to those of the E1A oncogene of adenoviruses and the E7 oncogene of human papillomaviruses."
17666013,Timed interactions between viral and cellular replication factors during the initiation of SV40 in vitro DNA replication.,"The initiation of SV40 (simian virus 40) DNA replication requires the co-operative interactions between the viral Tag (large T-antigen), RPA (replication protein A) and Pol (DNA polymerase alpha-primase) on the template DNA. Binding interfaces mapped on these enzymes and expressed as peptides competed with the mutual interactions of the native proteins. Prevention of the genuine interactions was accomplished only prior to the primer synthesis step and blocked the assembly of a productive initiation complex. Once the complex was engaged in the synthesis of an RNA primer and its extension, the interfering effects of the peptides ceased, suggesting a stable association of the replication factors during the initiation phase. Specific antibodies were still able to disrupt preformed interactions and inhibited primer synthesis and extension activities, underlining the crucial role of specific protein-protein contacts during the entire initiation process."
8380896,Initiation of simian virus 40 DNA replication requires the interaction of a specific domain of human DNA polymerase alpha with large T antigen.,"Initiation of cell-free simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication requires the interaction of DNA polymerase alpha/primase with a preinitiation complex containing the viral T antigen and cellular proteins, replication protein A, and topoisomerase I or II. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of the transition from preinitiation to initiation, the intermolecular interaction between human DNA polymerase alpha and T antigen was investigated. We have demonstrated that the human DNA polymerase alpha catalytic polypeptide is able to associate with SV40 large T antigen directly under physiological conditions. A physical association between these two proteins was detected by coimmunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies from insect cells coinfected with recombinant baculoviruses. A domain of human polymerase alpha physically interacting with T antigen was identified within the amino-terminal region from residues 195 to 313. This domain of human polymerase alpha was able to form a nonproductive complex with T antigen, causing inhibition of the SV40 DNA replication in vitro. Kinetics of the inhibition indicated that this polymerase domain can inhibit viral replication only during the preinitiation stage. Extra molecules of T antigen could partially overcome the inhibition only prior to initiation complex formation. The data support the conclusion that initiation of SV40 DNA replication requires the physical interaction of T antigen in the preinitiation complex with the amino-terminal domain of human polymerase alpha from amino acid residues 195 to 313."
7542742,Association of insulin receptor substrate 1 with simian virus 40 large T antigen.,"Mouse embryo cells expressing a wild-type number of insulin-like growth factor I receptors (IGF-IR) (W cells) can be transformed either by simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 T) or by overexpressed insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), singly transfected. Neither SV40 T antigen nor IRS-1, individually, can transform mouse embryo cells with a targeted disruption of the IGF-IR genes (R- cells). However, cotransfection of SV40 T antigen and IRS-1 does transform R- cells. In this study, using different antibodies and different cell lines, we found that SV40 T antigen and IRS-1 are coprecipitated from cell lysates in a specific fashion, regardless of whether the lysates are immunoprecipitated with an antibody to SV40 T antigen or an antibody to IRS-1. The same antibody to SV40 T antigen, however, fails to coprecipitate another substrate of IGF-IR, the transforming protein Shc, and two other signal-transducing molecules, Grb2 and Sos. Finally, an SV40 T antigen lacking the amino-terminal 250 amino acids fails to coprecipitate IRS-1 and also fails to transform R- cells overexpressing mouse IRS-1. These experiments indicate that IRS-1 associates with SV40 T antigen and that this association plays a critical role in the combined ability of these proteins to transform R- cells. This finding is discussed in light of the crucial role of the IGF-IR in the establishment and maintenance of the transformed phenotype."
16611888,Targeting of p300/CREB binding protein coactivators by simian virus 40 is mediated through p53.,"The primary transforming functions of simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 LT) are conferred primarily through the binding and inactivation of p53 and the retinoblastoma family members. Normal p53 function requires an association with the CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300 coactivators, and a ternary complex containing SV40 LT, p53, and CBP/p300 has been identified previously. In this report, we have evaluated a secondary function of p53 bound to the SV40 LT complex in mediating the binding of human CBP/p300. We demonstrate that p53 associated with SV40 LT was posttranslationally modified in a manner consistent with the binding of CBP/p300. Furthermore, expression of SV40 LT induced the proportion of p53 phosphorylated on S15. An essential function for p53 in bridging the interaction between SV40 LT and CBP/p300 was identified through the reconstitution of the SV40 LT-CBP/p300 complex upon p53 reexpression in p53-null cells. In addition, the SV40 LT-CBP/p300 complex was disrupted through RNA interference-mediated depletion of endogenous p53. We also demonstrate that SV40 LT was acetylated in a p300- and p53-dependent manner, at least in part through the CH3 domain of p300. Therefore, the binding of p53 serves to modify SV40 LT by targeting CBP and p300 binding to direct the acetylation of SV40 LT."
9830007,Interaction of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein Puralpha with the human polyomavirus JC virus early protein T-antigen.,"Large T-antigen, the major regulatory protein encoded by polyomaviruses, including Simian Virus 40 (SV40) and JC virus (JCV), is a multifunctional phosphoprotein that is involved in many viral and cellular events. In addition to its integral role in viral replication and cellular transformation, T-antigen also regulates transcription of both viral and cellular genes. In particular, the viral late promoter has been used as a model for the analysis of T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation. Earlier studies have demonstrated that the cellular protein Puralpha is able to attenuate the transcriptional activity of JCV T-antigen. We investigated the mechanism whereby Puralpha affects T-antigen function. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that Puralpha and JCV T-antigen associate in vivo, and glutathione S-transferase affinity binding assays revealed that these two proteins interact in vitro. Moreover, we localized the sequences of Puralpha that are important for the interaction between Puralpha and JCV T-antigen. In addition, we demonstrated that Puralpha interacts with the SV40 T-antigen. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that Puralpha and JCV T-antigen interact functionally as well. More specifically, Puralpha and a deletion mutant that interacts with T-antigen attenuated T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation. A Puralpha deletion mutant that is unable to interact with JCV T-antigen, however, was found to be incapable of abrogating JCV T-antigen transactivation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Puralpha and T-antigen interact both physically and functionally and that this interaction modulates T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation. The implication of these findings with respect to the cellular role of Puralpha is discussed."
1328865,Identification of binding sites on the regulatory A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A for the catalytic C subunit and for tumor antigens of simian virus 40 and polyomavirus.,"Protein phosphatase 2A is composed of three subunits: the catalytic subunit C and two regulatory subunits, A and B. The A subunit consists of 15 nonidentical repeats and has a rodlike shape. It is associated with the B and C subunits as well as with the simian virus 40 small T, polyomavirus small T, and polyomavirus medium T tumor antigens. We determined the binding sites on subunit A for subunit C and tumor antigens by site-directed mutagenesis of A. Twenty-four N- and C-terminal truncations and internal deletions of A were assayed by coimmunoprecipitation for their ability to bind C and tumor antigens. It was found that C binds to repeats 11 to 15 at the C terminus of A, whereas T antigens bind to overlapping but distinct regions of the N terminus. Simian virus 40 small T binds to repeats 3 to 6, and polyomavirus small T and medium T bind to repeats 2 to 8. The data suggest cooperativity between C and T antigens in binding to A. This is most apparent for medium T antigen, which can only bind to those A subunit molecules that provide the entire binding region for the C subunit. We infer from our results that B also binds to N-terminal repeats. A model of the small T/medium T/B-A-C complexes is presented."
10779361,Mutagenesis of the pRB pocket reveals that cell cycle arrest functions are separable from binding to viral oncoproteins.,"The pocket domain of pRB is required for pRB to arrest the cell cycle. This domain was originally defined as the region of the protein that is necessary and sufficient for pRB's interaction with adenovirus E1A and simian virus s40 large T antigen. These oncoproteins, and other pRB-binding proteins that are encoded by a variety of plant and animal viruses, use a conserved LXCXE motif to interact with pRB. Similar sequences have been identified in multiple cellular pRB-binding proteins, suggesting that the viruses have evolved to target a highly conserved binding site of pRB that is critical for its function. Here we have constructed a panel of pRB mutants in which conserved amino acids that are predicted to make close contacts with an LXCXE peptide were altered. Despite the conservation of the LXCXE binding site throughout evolution, pRB mutants that lack this site are able to induce a cell cycle arrest in a pRB-deficient tumor cell line. This G(1) arrest is overcome by cyclin D-cdk4 complexes but is resistant to inactivation by E7. Consequently, mutants lacking the LXCXE binding site were able to induce a G(1) arrest in HeLa cells despite the expression of HPV-18 E7. pRB mutants lacking the LXCXE binding site are defective in binding to adenovirus E1A and human papillomavirus type 16 E7 protein but exhibit wild-type binding to E2F or DP, and they retain the ability to interact with CtIP and HDAC1, two transcriptional corepressors that contain LXCXE-like sequences. Consistent with these observations, the pRB mutants are able to actively repress transcription. These observations suggest that viral oncoproteins depend on the LXCXE-binding site of pRB for interaction to a far greater extent than cellular proteins that are critical for cell cycle arrest or transcriptional repression. Mutation of this binding site allows pRB to function as a cell cycle regulator while being resistant to inactivation by viral oncoproteins."
9067421,A DNA polymerase alpha accessory protein exhibits structural and functional similarities to SV40 large tumor antigen.,"Untransformed cells have been proposed to require a protein homologous to SV40 large tumor antigen (TAg) which functions as a component of the replicase complex during the initiation of DNA synthesis. By definition, this should be a phosphoprotein which interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) in G0 or early G1, and is capable of binding to and potentiating the activity of DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha). This protein should also be an ATP-dependent helicase which interacts with the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein, RP-A. Because of these requirements, a TAg homologous protein could be expected to contain epitopes with amino acid sequences similar to those of TAg at critical functional sites, such as ATP, pRb and pol alpha binding sites. TAg and a putative cellular homolog of TAg, DNA pol alpha accessory protein (alpha AP), were compared for pRb and pol alpha interaction, and for immunological identity. The analyses utilized immunoaffinity-purified TAg and pRb from a baculovirus expression system, and DNA pol alpha/primase and alpha AP chromatographically isolated from a mouse lymphocytic leukemia cell line. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the pol alpha or pRb binding sites on TAg interacted with alpha AP strongly enough to be employed for immunoaffinity purification of alpha AP. Anti-pRb and anti-TAg reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated pRb bound to TAg and pRb bound to alpha AP. The functional consequences of pol alpha interaction with TAg or alpha AP in the presence or absence of pRb was determined using pol alpha nucleotide incorporation assays. alpha AP exhibited the capacity to stimulate pol alpha activity, a capacity which was diminished in the presence of pRb. Lastly, TAg and alpha AP independently co-purified with pol alpha through a multi-step chromatographic protocol. These data indicate that a pol alpha accessory protein, alpha AP, exhibits functional and immunological similarities to SV40 TAg, suggest that alpha AP is involved in regulation of the initiation of DNA synthesis, and support the proposal that alpha AP may be a normal cell protein homologous to SV40 large T antigen."
9203586,SV40 large T antigen binds to the TBP-TAF(I) complex SL1 and coactivates ribosomal RNA transcription.,"SV40 large T antigen is a multifunctional regulatory protein that plays a key role in the viral life cycle and can stimulate cell proliferation. To accomplish this, large T antigen has to control the expression of cellular genes involved in cell cycle progression and cell growth. rRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is tightly associated with cell growth and proliferation, and previous studies indicated that large T antigen up-regulates RNA Pol I transcription in SV40-infected cells. How this process occurs is currently unclear. To investigate the mechanisms of large T antigen stimulation of RNA Pol I transcription, we have established an in vitro transcription system that is responsive to large T antigen. Here, we show that recombinant large T antigen stimulates Pol I transcription reconstituted with purified RNA Pol I, UBF, and the TBP/TAF complex SL1. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that large T antigen directly binds to SL1, in vitro, as well as in SV40-infected cells. In addition, our data indicate that this interaction occurs by direct association with three SL1 subunits, namely TBP, TAF(I)48, and TAF(I)110. Transcription studies with large T antigen deletion mutants show that the 538-amino-acid amino-terminal domain is necessary for full stimulation of Pol I transcription. Importantly, mutants that no longer bind to SL1 are also unable to stimulate Pol I transcription. This indicates that recruitment of large T antigen to the rRNA promoter by SL1 constitutes a crucial step in the activation process. Taken together with recent studies on large T antigen activation of RNA Pol II transcription, these results suggest that viral modulation of genes involved in cell proliferation involves direct targeting of promoter-specific TBP/TAF complexes (i.e., SL1 or TFIID) by large T antigen."
10347196,"Identification of a novel SNF2/SWI2 protein family member, SRCAP, which interacts with CREB-binding protein.","The ability of cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) to function as a co-activator for a number of transcription factors appears to be mediated by its ability to act as a histone acetyltransferase and through its interaction with a number of other proteins (general transcription factors, histone acetyltransferases, and other co-activators). Here we report that CBP also interacts with a novel ATPase termed Snf2-Related CBP Activator Protein (SRCAP). Consistent with this activity, SRCAP contains the conserved ATPase domain found within members of the Snf2 family. Transfection experiments demonstrate that SRCAP is able to activate transcription when expressed as a Gal-SRCAP chimera and that SRCAP also enhances the ability of CBP to activate transcription. The adenoviral protein E1A was found to disrupt interaction between SRCAP and CBP possibly representing a mechanism for E1A-mediated transcriptional repression."
1331501,Homologous sequences in adenovirus E1A and human papillomavirus E7 proteins mediate interaction with the same set of cellular proteins.,"Studies of adenovirus E1A oncoprotein mutants suggest that the association of E1A with the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is necessary for E1A-mediated transformation. Mutational analysis of E1A indicates that two regions of pRB are required for E1A to form stable complexes with the retinoblastoma protein. In addition to pRB binding, these regions are necessary for E1A association with several other cellular proteins, including p130, p107, cyclin A, and p33cdk2. Here we show that short synthetic peptides containing the pRB-binding sequences of E1A are sufficient for interaction with p107, cyclin A, and p130. The E7 protein of human papillomavirus type 16 contains an element that binds to pRB and appears to be functionally homologous to the E1A sequences. Peptides containing this region of the E7 protein were able to interact with p107, cyclin A, and p130 in addition to pRB. These findings suggest that the common mechanism of transformation used by these viral oncogenes involves their association with a set of polypeptides."
16840345,Vaccinia virus B1R kinase interacts with JIP1 and modulates c-Jun-dependent signaling.,"Viruses have to adjust to the host cell to guarantee their life cycle and survival. This aspect of the virus-host cell interaction is probably performed by viral proteins, such as serine-threonine kinases, that are present early during infection. Vaccinia virus has an early Ser-Thr kinase, B1R, which, although required for successful viral infection, is poorly characterized regarding its effects on cellular proteins, and thus, its potential contribution to pathogenesis is not known. Signaling by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is mediated by the assembly of complexes between these kinases and the JIP scaffold proteins. To understand how vaccinia virus B1R can affect the host, its roles in the cellular signaling by MAPK complexes and c-Jun activation have been studied. Independently of its kinase activity, B1R can interact with the central region of the JIP1 scaffold protein. The B1R-JIP1 complex increases the amount of MAPK bound to JIP1; thus, MKK7 and TAK1 either bind with higher affinity or bind more stably to JIP1, while there is an increase in the phosphorylation state of JNK bound to JIP1. The functional consequence of these more stable interactions is an increase in the activity of transcription factors, such as c-Jun, that respond to these complexes. Furthermore, B1R is also able to directly phosphorylate c-Jun in residues different from those targeted by JNK and, thus, B1R can also cooperate by an independent route in c-Jun activation. Vaccinia virus B1R can thus modulate the signaling of pathways that respond to cellular stress."
15194749,Functional interaction between class II histone deacetylases and ICP0 of herpes simplex virus type 1.,"This study describes the physical and functional interactions between ICP0 of herpes simplex virus type 1 and class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) 4, 5, and 7. Class II HDACs are mainly known for their participation in the control of cell differentiation through the regulation of the activity of the transcription factor MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2), implicated in muscle development and neuronal survival. Immunofluorescence experiments performed on transfected cells showed that ICP0 colocalizes with and reorganizes the nuclear distribution of ectopically expressed class I and II HDACs. In addition, endogenous HDAC4 and at least one of its binding partners, the corepressor protein SMRT (for silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptor), undergo changes in their nuclear distribution in ICP0-transfected cells. As a result, during infection endogenous HDAC4 colocalizes with ICP0. Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays confirmed that class II but not class I HDACs specifically interacted with ICP0 through their amino-terminal regions. This region, which is not conserved in class I HDACs but homologous to the MITR (MEF2-interacting transcription repressor) protein, is responsible for the repression, in a deacetylase-independent manner, of MEF2 by sequestering it under an inactive form in the nucleus. Consequently, we show that ICP0 is able to overcome the HDAC5 amino-terminal- and MITR-induced MEF2A repression in gene reporter assays. This is the first report of a viral protein interacting with and controlling the repressor activity of class II HDACs. We discuss the putative consequences of such an interaction for the biology of the virus both during lytic infection and reactivation from latency."
17074758,The vaccinia virus protein F1L interacts with Bim and inhibits activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax.,"Vaccinia virus, the prototypic member of the orthopoxvirus genus, encodes the mitochondrial-localized protein F1L that functions to protect cells from apoptotic death and inhibits cytochrome c release. We previously showed that F1L interacts with the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bak and inhibits activation of Bak following an apoptotic stimulus (Wasilenko, S. T., Banadyga, L., Bond, D., and Barry, M. (2005) J. Virol. 79, 14031-14043). In addition to Bak, the pro-apoptotic protein Bax is also capable of initiating cytochrome c release suggesting that vaccinia virus infection could also inhibit Bax activity. Here we show that F1L inhibits the activity of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax by inhibiting oligomerization and N-terminal activation of Bax. F1L expression also inhibited the subcellular redistribution of Bax to the mitochondria and the insertion of Bax into the outer mitochondrial membrane. The ability of F1L to inhibit Bax activation does not require Bak, because F1L expression inhibited cytochrome c release and Bax activation in Bak-deficient cells. No interaction between Bax and F1L was detected during infection, suggesting that F1L functions upstream of Bax activation. Notably, F1L was capable of interacting with the BH3-only protein BimL as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, and F1L expression inhibited apoptosis induced by BimL. These studies suggest that, in addition to interacting with the pro-apoptotic protein Bak, F1L also functions to indirectly inhibit the activation of Bax, likely by interfering with the pro-apoptotic activity of BH3-only proteins such as BimL."
2153075,The region of the HPV E7 oncoprotein homologous to adenovirus E1a and Sv40 large T antigen contains separate domains for Rb binding and casein kinase II phosphorylation.,"Some genital human papillomavirus (HPV) types, such as 16 and 18, are highly associated with malignant cervical tumors while others, such as HPV 6, are only rarely found in these malignancies. The E7 oncoproteins of HPV 6, 16 and 18 each have a 17 amino acid region with striking homology to adenovirus E1a and SV40 LT. E1a, LT and the E7 oncoprotein of HPV16 all bind the cellular Rb protein in vitro, and for E1a and LT this region of homology contains sequences essential for interaction with Rb. We have now found that in HPV 16 E7 this region (amino acids 21-37) contains two separate biochemical activities, each of which contributes to E7-mediated transformation. Rb binding was localized to the N terminus of this region, while the C terminus was shown to serve as a substrate for casein kinase (CK) II, which phosphorylated serine-31 and serine-32. Replacement of the two serines by non-phosphorylatable amino acids led to a reduction in transforming activity and abolished phosphorylation but did not affect Rb binding. Rb binding and CK II phosphorylation were also examined for the E7 proteins of HPV 6 and HPV 18. HPV 16 and 18 E7 bound similar amounts of Rb, but HPV 6 E7 consistently bound less. Phosphorylation rates also varied, with HPV 18 E7 being 2-fold faster than HPV 16 E7, which in turn was 2-fold faster than HPV 6 E7. We conclude that Rb binding and phosphorylation of E7 by CKII are independent activities which are required for efficient transformation by E7 and that these activities correlate directly with the relative oncogenic potential of these viruses."
15140983,"Proteomics of herpes simplex virus replication compartments: association of cellular DNA replication, repair, recombination, and chromatin remodeling proteins with ICP8.","In this study, we have used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify over 50 cellular and viral proteins that are associated with the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) ICP8 single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Many of the coprecipitating cellular proteins are known members of large cellular complexes involved in (i) DNA replication or damage repair, including RPA and MSH6; (ii) nonhomologous and homologous recombination, including the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, Ku86, and Rad50; and (iii) chromatin remodeling, including BRG1, BRM, hSNF2H, BAF155, mSin3a, and histone deacetylase 2. It appears that DNA mediates the association of certain proteins with ICP8, while more direct protein-protein interactions mediate the association with other proteins. A number of these proteins accumulate in viral replication compartments in the infected cell nucleus, indicating that these proteins may have a role in viral replication. WRN, which functions in cellular recombination pathways via its helicase and exonuclease activities, is not absolutely required for viral replication, as viral yields are only very slightly, if at all, decreased in WRN-deficient human primary fibroblasts compared to control cells. In Ku70-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, viral yields are increased by almost 50-fold, suggesting that the cellular nonhomologous end-joining pathway inhibits HSV replication. We hypothesize that some of the proteins coprecipitating with ICP8 are involved in HSV replication and may give new insight into viral replication mechanisms."
17947517,Protein tyrosine phosphatase H1 is a target of the E6 oncoprotein of high-risk genital human papillomaviruses.,"The E6 proteins of high-risk genital human papillomaviruses (HPV), such as HPV types 16 and 18, possess a conserved C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, which mediates interaction with some cellular PDZ domain proteins. The binding of E6 usually results in their ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The ability of E6 to bind to PDZ domain proteins correlates with the oncogenic potential. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, GST pull-down experiments and coimmunoprecipitations, we identified the protein tyrosine phosphatase H1 (PTPH1/PTPN3) as a novel target of the PDZ-binding motif of E6 of HPV16 and 18. PTPH1 has been suggested to function as tumour suppressor protein, since mutational analysis revealed somatic mutations in PTPH1 in a minor fraction of various human tumours. We show here that HPV16 E6 accelerated the proteasome-mediated degradation of PTPH1, which required the binding of E6 to the cellular ubiquitin ligase E6-AP and to PTPH1. The endogenous levels of PTPH1 were particularly low in HPV-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines. The reintroduction of the E2 protein into the HPV16-positive cervical carcinoma cell line SiHa, known to lead to a sharp repression of E6 expression and to induce growth suppression, resulted in an increase of the amount of PTPH1. Our data suggest that reducing the level of PTPH1 may contribute to the oncogenic activity of high-risk genital E6 proteins."
7896830,Vacuolar H(+)-ATPase mutants transform cells and define a binding site for the papillomavirus E5 oncoprotein.,"The 16K subunit of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase binds specifically to the bovine (BPV) and human (HPV) papillomavirus E5 oncoproteins, and it has been suggested that this interaction may contribute to cell transformation (Goldstein, D. J., and Schlegel, R. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 137-146; Goldstein, D. J., Finbow, M. E., Andresson, T., McLean, P., Smith, K., Bubb, V. J., and Schlegel, R. (1991) Nature 352, 347-349; Conrad, M., Bubb, V. J., and Schlegel, R. (1993) J. Virol. 67, 6170-6178; Goldstein, D. J., Toyama, R., Schlegel, R., and Dhar, R. (1992) Virology 190, 889-893). We generated mutations within the 16K protein to define binding domains for BPV-1 E5 as well as to characterize the role of 16K in cell transformation. 16K consists predominantly of 4 transmembrane (TM) domains. We showed that mutations within the TM4 domain severely inhibited E5 binding. More specifically, conversion of glutamic acid 143 to arginine within TM4 severely reduced 16K/E5 binding, suggesting that charged interactions facilitated efficient binding. This hypothesis was confirmed by demonstrating that binding to the defective 16K arginine mutant could be restored by complementary charge mutations in E5; conversion of E5 glutamine 17 to glutamic acid or aspartic acid enhanced interactions with the 16K arginine mutant. Surprisingly, mutants in TM4 not only bound poorly to wild-type E5 but were converted into an oncoprotein and induced anchorage-independent growth of NIH 3T3 cells. These data define glutamic acid 143 in the 16K TM4 domain and glutamine 17 within E5 as important contributors to E5/16K binding and suggest a role for the 16K protein in the regulation of cell proliferation."
7644508,Interaction of herpes simplex virus 1 origin-binding protein with DNA polymerase alpha.,"The herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genome encodes seven polypeptides that are required for its replication. These include a heterodimeric DNA polymerase, a single-strand-DNA-binding protein, a heterotrimeric helicase/primase, and a protein (UL9 protein) that binds specifically to an HSV-1 origin of replication (oris). We demonstrate here that UL9 protein interacts specifically with the 180-kDa catalytic subunit of the cellular DNA polymerase alpha-primase. This interaction can be detected by immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against either of these proteins, by gel mobility shift of an oris-UL9 protein complex, and by stimulation of DNA polymerase activity by the UL9 protein. These findings suggest that enzymes required for cellular DNA replication also participate in HSV-1 DNA replication."
16439990,Interaction of F1L with the BH3 domain of Bak is responsible for inhibiting vaccinia-induced apoptosis.,"Apoptosis represents an important cellular defence mechanism against viral pathogens by virtue of its ability to remove infected cells. Consequently, many viruses have developed numerous strategies to prevent or delay host cell apoptosis in order to achieve productive replication. Here we report that deletion of the F1L gene from the vaccinia genome results in increased apoptosis during infection. We demonstrate that F1L, which has no sequence homology to Bcl-2 family members, inhibits apoptosis at the level of mitochondria by binding to Bak. As a consequence, F1L prevents Bak activation, oligomerization and interaction with active Bax, all critical steps in the induction of apoptosis. We demonstrate that residues 64-84 of F1L interact directly with the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) domain of Bak. This region of F1L has limited sequence similarity to known Bak-interacting BH3 domains. We also find that such additional BH3-like domains exist in the vaccinia genome. We conclude that F1L uses this specific, BH3-like domain to bind and inhibit Bak at the mitochondria."
16823848,E5 protein of human papillomavirus 16 downregulates HLA class I and interacts with the heavy chain via its first hydrophobic domain.,"Human papillomavirus type 16 E5 protein (HPV-16 E5) is expressed early in papillomavirus infection and is localised primarily in the cell Golgi apparatus (GA) and endoplasmic reticulum. E5 prevents transport of the major histocompatibility class I (MHC I; HLA class I in humans) to the cell surface and retains the complex in the GA. We report that these effects are due, at least in part, to the interaction between E5 and HLA I heavy chain (HC). We also demonstrate that the down-regulation of surface HLA I and interaction with HC are mediated by the first hydrophobic domain of E5. Although E5 downregulates classical HLA selectively as it does not downregulate non-classical HLA, the interaction with the HC of classical HLA I is not specific for a particular haplotype of HLA I. This suggests that E5 can interfere with antigen presentation by most, if not all, classical HLA I haplotypes, with potentially serious consequences as the ability of infected cells to present antigenic peptides to effector T cells would be compromised."
18457437,Identification of intracellular proteins associated with the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 5 using an efficient TAP procedure and FT-ICR mass spectrometry.,"Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 5 (EBNA5) is one of the first viral proteins detected after primary EBV infection and has been shown to be required for efficient transformation of B lymphocytes. EBNA5 is a protein that has many suggested functions but the underlying biology remains to be clarified. To gain further insight into the biological roles of the proposed multifunctional EBNA5, we isolated EBNA5 containing protein complexes using a modified tandem affinity purification (TAP) method and identified the protein components by LC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic digests on a LTQ-FT-ICR mass spectrometer. The modified TAP tag contained a Protein A domain and a StrepTagII sequence separated by two Tobacco Etch Virus protease cleavage sites and was fused to the C-terminus of EBNA5. Our results confirmed the wide applicability of this two-step affinity purification strategy for purification of protein complexes in mammalian cells. A total of 147 novel putative EBNA5 interaction partners were identified, 37 of which were validated with LC-MS/MS in split-tag experiments or in co-immuno precipitates from HEK293 cell extracts. This subgroup included the Bcl2-associated Athanogene 2 (BAG2) co-chaperone involved in protein folding and renaturation, the 26S proteasome subunit 2 involved in regulation of ubiquitin/proteasome protein degradation, and the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNP M) involved in pre-mRNA processing. These EBNA5 interactors were further verified by co-immunoprecipitations from cell extracts of three EBV-positive lymphoblastoid lines. The combination of the Hsp70, Hsc70, BAG2 and 26S proteasome subunit 2 interactors suggests that EBNA5 might have a functional relationship with protein quality control systems that recognize proteins with abnormal structures and either refold them to normal conformation or target them for degradation. Our study also confirms previously identified interactors including HA95, Hsp70, Hsc70, Hsp27, HAX-1, Prolyl 4-hydroxylase, S3a, and alpha- and beta-tubulin."
11878931,Vaccinia virus CrmE encodes a soluble and cell surface tumor necrosis factor receptor that contributes to virus virulence.,"Poxviruses encode soluble cytokine receptors to interfere with host immune functions. Cells infected with vaccinia virus (VV) strains USSR, Lister, and Evans express soluble and cell surface tumor necrosis factor receptors (vTNFRs). We have characterized vTNFR activity in VV USSR and identified an open reading frame that encodes both soluble and cell surface activity, hereafter referred to as VV cytokine response modifier E (VV CrmE). Expression and characterization from recombinant VV and baculovirus showed VV CrmE to be an 18-kDa protein that bound human, mouse, and rat TNF-alpha, but not human LT alpha. VV CrmE inhibited the cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of human, but not mouse or rat, TNF in vitro. Nonetheless, in a murine intranasal model, USSR recombinants lacking CrmE were attenuated, demonstrating a role in vivo. Furthermore, expression of VV or cowpox virus vTNFRs from VV strain WR (which itself does not express a vTNFR) was shown to enhance virulence in the murine model."
18497748,The Moraxella adhesin UspA1 binds to its human CEACAM1 receptor by a deformable trimeric coiled-coil.,"Moraxella catarrhalis is a ubiquitous human-specific bacterium commonly associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including otitis media, sinusitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The bacterium uses an autotransporter protein UspA1 to target an important human cellular receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). Using X-ray crystallography, we show that the CEACAM1 receptor-binding region of UspA1 unusually consists of an extended, rod-like left-handed trimeric coiled-coil. Mutagenesis and binding studies of UspA1 and the N-domain of CEACAM1 have been used to delineate the interacting surfaces between ligand and receptor and guide assembly of the complex. However, solution scattering, molecular modelling and electron microscopy analyses all indicate that significant bending of the UspA1 coiled-coil stalk also occurs. This explains how UspA1 can engage CEACAM1 at a site far distant from its head group, permitting closer proximity of the respective cell surfaces during infection."
20959808,Polypeptide in the chaperonin cage partly protrudes out and then folds inside or escapes outside.,"The current mechanistic model of chaperonin-assisted protein folding assumes that the substrate protein in the cage, formed by GroEL central cavity capped with GroES, is isolated from outside and exists as a free polypeptide. However, using ATPase-deficient GroEL mutants that keep GroES bound, we found that, in the rate-limiting intermediate of a chaperonin reaction, the unfolded polypeptide in the cage partly protrudes through a narrow space near the GroEL/GroES interface. Then, the entire polypeptide is released either into the cage or to the outside medium. The former adopts a native structure very rapidly and the latter undergoes spontaneous folding. Partition of the in-cage folding and the escape varies among substrate proteins and is affected by hydrophobic interaction between the polypeptide and GroEL cavity wall. The ATPase-active GroEL with decreased in-cage folding produced less of a native model substrate protein in Escherichia coli cells. Thus, the polypeptide in the critical GroEL-GroES complex is neither free nor completely confined in the cage, but it is interacting with GroEL's apical region, partly protruding to outside."
11099378,Phage display screening reveals an association between germline-specific transcription factor Oct-4 and multiple cellular proteins.,"Oct-4 is a transcription factor that is specifically expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells and in cell lines derived thereof. In these cells, Oct-4 activates transcription from remote binding sites due to as of yet unknown co-activators. Expression of Oct-4 in differentiated cells is not sufficient to activate transcription from a distance, rather it requires the co-expression of co-activators such as the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A. In this paper, we used phage display to identify Oct-4-interacting proteins. We first analyzed the interaction between Oct-4 and E1A in order to optimize the biochemical conditions that enable Oct-4-specific interactions with other interacting proteins. A panning approach was used to enrich Oct-4 interacting phages from a pool of excess unspecific phages. The biochemical conditions established in our interaction assays were then used to screen a P19 EC cell cDNA expression library in M13 filamentous phage. A number of phage clones displaying portions of unknown and known transcription factors were obtained, from which the HMG-1 transcription factor was identified. HMG-1, and the closely related factor HMG-2, interact with Oct-4 when co-expressed in mammalian cells. In addition, HMG-1 was found to cooperate with Oct-4 in P19 EC cells. These results provide the first evidence of a non-viral factor that enhances Oct-4 distance-dependent transactivation in stem cells."
21569203,The A domain of fibronectin-binding protein B of Staphylococcus aureus contains a novel fibronectin binding site.,"The fibronectin-binding proteins FnBPA and FnBPB are multifunctional adhesins than can also bind to fibrinogen and elastin. In this study, the N2N3 subdomains of region A of FnBPB were shown to bind fibrinogen with a similar affinity to those of FnBPA (2 μM). The binding site for FnBPB in fibrinogen was localized to the C-terminus of the γ-chain. Like clumping factor A, region A of FnBPB bound to the γ-chain of fibrinogen in a Ca(2+)-inhibitable manner. The deletion of 17 residues from the C-terminus of domain N3 and the substitution of two residues in equivalent positions for crucial residues for fibrinogen binding in clumping factor A and FnBPA eliminated fibrinogen binding by FnBPB. This indicates that FnBPB binds fibrinogen by the dock-lock-latch mechanism. In contrast, the A domain of FnBPB bound fibronectin with K(D) = 2.5 μM despite lacking any of the known fibronectin-binding tandem repeats. A truncate lacking the C-terminal 17 residues (latching peptide) bound fibronectin with the same affinity, suggesting that the FnBPB A domain binds fibronectin by a novel mechanism. The substitution of the two residues required for fibrinogen binding also resulted in a loss of fibronectin binding. This, combined with the observation that purified subdomain N3 bound fibronectin with a measurable, but reduced, K(D) of 20 μM, indicates that the type I modules of fibronectin bind to both the N2 and N3 subdomains. The fibronectin-binding ability of the FnBPB A domain was also functional when the protein was expressed on and anchored to the surface of staphylococcal cells, showing that it is not an artifact of recombinant protein expression."
20875085,Functional analysis of a murine monoclonal antibody against the repetitive region of the fibronectin-binding adhesins fibronectin-binding protein A and fibronectin-binding protein B from Staphylococcus aureus.,"Fibronectin-binding proteins A and B are multifunctional LPXTG staphylococcal adhesins, comprising an N-terminal region that binds fibrinogen and elastin, and a C-terminal domain that interacts with fibronectin. The C-terminal domain of fibronectin-binding protein A is organized into 11 tandem repeats, six of which bind the ligand with high affinity; other sites bind more weakly. Fibronectin-binding protein B has been postulated to harbor 10 rather than 11 repeats, but it contains the same number of high-affinity fibronectin-binding sites as fibronectin-binding protein A. In this study, we confirm this prediction and show that six of 10 sites bind with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. We also found that the full-length repetitive region of fibronectin-binding protein B stimulated the production of a mAb (15E11) that binds with high affinity to an epitope shared by repeats 9 and 10 from both adhesins. With the use of truncated fragments of repeat 9 of fibronectin-binding protein A, we mapped the antibody epitope to the N-terminal segment and the fibronectin-binding site to the C-terminal segment of the repeat. The distinct localization of the 15E11 epitope and the fibronectin-binding site suggests that the interfering effect of the antibody might result from steric hindrance or a conformational change in the structure that reduces the accessibility of fibronectin to its binding determinant. The epitope is well exposed on the surface of staphylococcal cells, as determined by genetic analyses, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry. When incubated with cells of Staphylococcus aureus strains, 15E11 inhibits attachment of bacteria to surface-coated fibronectin by almost 70%."
20088881,"Targeting mechanism of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor by a prototypical viral oncoprotein. Structural modularity, intrinsic disorder and phosphorylation of human papillomavirus E7.","DNA tumor viruses ensure genome amplification by hijacking the cellular replication machinery and forcing infected cells to enter the S phase. The retinoblastoma (Rb) protein controls the G1/S checkpoint, and is targeted by several viral oncoproteins, among these the E7 protein from human papillomaviruses (HPVs). A quantitative investigation of the interaction mechanism between the HPV16 E7 protein and the RbAB domain in solution revealed that 90% of the binding energy is determined by the LxCxE motif, with an additional binding determinant (1.0 kcal.mol(-1)) located in the C-terminal domain of E7, establishing a dual-contact mode. The stoichiometry and subnanomolar affinity of E7 indicated that it can bind RbAB as a monomer. The low-risk HPV11 E7 protein bound 2.0 kcal.mol(-1) more weakly than the high-risk HPV16 and HPV18 type counterparts, but the modularity and binding mode were conserved. Phosphorylation at a conserved casein kinase II site in the natively unfolded N-terminal domain of E7 affected the local conformation by increasing the polyproline II content and stabilizing an extended conformation, which allowed for a tighter interaction with the Rb protein. Thus, the E7-RbAB interaction involves multiple motifs within the N-terminal domain of E7 and at least two conserved interaction surfaces in RbAB. We discussed a mechanistic model of the interaction of the Rb protein with a viral target in solution, integrated with structural data and the analysis of other cellular and viral proteins, which provided information about the balance of interactions involving the Rb protein and how these determine the progression into either the normal cell cycle or transformation."
18005740,Colocalization of transcription and translation within cytoplasmic poxvirus factories coordinates viral expression and subjugates host functions.,"Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that include the causal agent of human smallpox and vaccinia virus. Poxviruses replicate in cytoplasmic foci known as DNA factories. Here we show that a virus-encoded transcription factor, viral mRNA, cellular RNA-binding protein heterodimer G3BP/Caprin-1 (p137), translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4G, and ribosomal proteins are concentrated in the same subdomains of cytoplasmic DNA factories. Furthermore, a cell coinfected with two recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing a virus core protein fused to cyan or yellow fluorescent protein displayed separate cyan and yellow factories, indicating that each factory formed from a single genome and was the site of transcription and translation as well as DNA replication. Hijacking of the host translation apparatus within the factory likely enhances the efficiency of virus replication and contributes to the suppression of host protein synthesis, thereby facilitating poxvirus subjugation of the cell."
15507623,Role of the PDZ domain-binding motif of the oncoprotein E6 in the pathogenesis of human papillomavirus type 31.,"A number of PDZ domain-containing proteins have been identified as binding partners for the oncoprotein E6 of the high-risk type human papillomaviruses (HPVs). These include hDlg, hScrib, MAGI-1, MAGI-2, MAGI-3, and MUPP1. The PDZ domain-binding motif (-X-T-X-V) at the carboxy terminus of E6 is essential for targeting PDZ proteins for proteasomal degradation. The presence of this motif only in the high-risk HPVs suggests its possible role in HPV-induced oncogenesis. To investigate the role of the PDZ domain-binding motif of E6 in the HPV life cycle, two mutant HPV31 genomes were constructed: E6ValDelta, with a deletion of the last amino acid residue of E6 (valine), and E6ETQVDelta, with a deletion of the entire PDZ domain-binding motif of E6 (ETQV). Three human foreskin keratinocyte (HFK) cell lines were established which maintained transfected wild-type HPV31 or either of two mutant genomes. Cells containing either of two mutant genomes were significantly retarded in their growth rates and reduced in their viral copy numbers compared to those transfected with wild-type genomes. Western analysis did not reveal any significant changes in the levels of PDZ proteins following stable transfection of any HPV31 genomes into HFKs. Although the E6ETQVDelta-transfected HFKs exhibited a pattern of morphological differentiation that appeared different from the HPV31 wild-type-transfected HFKs in organotypic raft cultures, immunohistochemical analysis failed to identify substantial changes in the differentiation-dependent membrane localization of hDlg proteins. These results suggest that binding of E6 to PDZ proteins modulates the early viral functions such as proliferation and maintenance of the viral copy number in undifferentiated cells."
16611247,"Human scribble, a novel tumor suppressor identified as a target of high-risk HPV E6 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, interacts with adenomatous polyposis coli.","Recently, we have identified human scribble (hScrib), human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor Scribble, as a substrate of human papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation dependent on ubiquitin-protein ligase E6AP. Human Scribble, classified as a LAP protein containing leucine-rich repeats and PDZ domains, interacts with E6 through its PDZ domains and C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif of E6 protein. Interaction between human Discs Large (hDlg), which is a substrate of E6 for the ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) has been shown. Here, we investigated whether hScrib and APC interact with each other in vitro and in vivo. Interaction between hScrib and APC is mediated by the PDZ domains 1 and 4 of hScrib and C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif of APC. Human Scribble co-localized with APC at the synaptic sites of hippocampal neuron and at the tip of membrane protrusion in the epithelial cell line. Interference of the interaction between hScrib and APC caused disruption of adherens junction. Knockdown of hScrib expression by RNAi disrupts localization of APC at the adherens junction. These data suggest that hScrib may participate in the hDlg-APC complex through its PDZ domains and regulate cell cycle and neural function by associating with APC."
17123957,Vaccinia virus N1L protein resembles a B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family protein.,"Poxviruses encode immuno-modulatory proteins capable of subverting host defenses. The poxvirus vaccinia expresses a small 14-kDa protein, N1L, that is critical for virulence. We report the crystal structure of N1L, which reveals an unexpected but striking resemblance to host apoptotic regulators of the B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family. Although N1L lacks detectable Bcl-2 homology (BH) motifs at the sequence level, we show that N1L binds with high affinity to the BH3 peptides of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in vitro, consistent with a role for N1L in modulating host antiviral defenses."
12706723,Structural and thermodynamic basis for the interaction of the Src SH2 domain with the activated form of the PDGF beta-receptor.,"Recruitment of the Src kinase to the activated form of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor involves recognition of a unique sequence motif in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor by the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of the enzyme. This motif contains two phosphotyrosine residues separated by one residue (sequence pYIpYV where pY indicates a phosphotyrosine). Here, we provide the thermodynamic and structural basis for the binding of this motif by the Src SH2 domain. We show that the second phosphorylation event increases the free energy window for specific interaction and that the physiological target is exquisitely designed for the task of recruiting specifically an SH2 domain which otherwise demonstrates very little intrinsic ability to discriminate sequences C-terminal to the first phosphorylation event. Surprisingly, we show that water plays a role in the recognition process."
19942850,Structural insights into the dual nucleotide exchange and GDI displacement activity of SidM/DrrA.,"GDP-bound prenylated Rabs, sequestered by GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) in the cytosol, are delivered to destined sub-cellular compartment and subsequently activated by GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) catalysing GDP-to-GTP exchange. The dissociation of GDI from Rabs is believed to require a GDF (GDI displacement factor). Only two RabGDFs, human PRA-1 and Legionella pneumophila SidM/DrrA, have been identified so far and the molecular mechanism of GDF is elusive. Here, we present the structure of a SidM/DrrA fragment possessing dual GEF and GDF activity in complex with Rab1. SidM/DrrA reconfigures the Switch regions of the GTPase domain of Rab1, as eukaryotic GEFs do toward cognate Rabs. Structure-based mutational analyses show that the surface of SidM/DrrA, catalysing nucleotide exchange, is involved in GDI1 displacement from prenylated Rab1:GDP. In comparison with an eukaryotic GEF TRAPP I, this bacterial GEF/GDF exhibits high binding affinity for Rab1 with GDP retained at the active site, which appears as the key feature for the GDF activity of the protein."
18551131,Vaccinia virus anti-apoptotic F1L is a novel Bcl-2-like domain-swapped dimer that binds a highly selective subset of BH3-containing death ligands.,"Apoptosis is an important part of the host's defense mechanism for eliminating invading pathogens. Some viruses express proteins homologous in sequence and function to mammalian pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins. Anti-apoptotic F1L expressed by vaccinia virus is essential for survival of infected cells, but it bears no discernable sequence homology to proteins other than its immediate orthologues in related pox viruses. Here we report that the crystal structure of F1L reveals a Bcl-2-like fold with an unusual N-terminal extension. The protein forms a novel domain-swapped dimer in which the alpha1 helix is the exchanged domain. Binding studies reveal an atypical BH3-binding profile, with sub-micromolar affinity only for the BH3 peptide of pro-apoptotic Bim and low micromolar affinity for the BH3 peptides of Bak and Bax. This binding interaction is sensitive to F1L mutations within the predicted canonical BH3-binding groove, suggesting parallels between how vaccinia virus F1L and myxoma virus M11L bind BH3 domains. Structural comparison of F1L with other Bcl-2 family members reveals a novel sequence signature that redefines the BH4 domain as a structural motif present in both pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members, including viral Bcl-2-like proteins."
20080564,Structure of HIV-1 gp120 with gp41-interactive region reveals layered envelope architecture and basis of conformational mobility.,"The viral spike of HIV-1 is composed of three gp120 envelope glycoproteins attached noncovalently to three gp41 transmembrane molecules. Viral entry is initiated by binding to the CD4 receptor on the cell surface, which induces large conformational changes in gp120. These changes not only provide a model for receptor-triggered entry, but affect spike sensitivity to drug- and antibody-mediated neutralization. Although some of the details of the CD4-induced conformational change have been visualized by crystal structures and cryoelectron tomograms, the critical gp41-interactive region of gp120 was missing from previous atomic-level characterizations. Here we determine the crystal structure of an HIV-1 gp120 core with intact gp41-interactive region in its CD4-bound state, compare this structure to unliganded and antibody-bound forms to identify structurally invariant and plastic components, and use ligand-oriented cryoelectron tomograms to define component mobility in the viral spike context. Newly defined gp120 elements proximal to the gp41 interface complete a 7-stranded beta-sandwich, which appeared invariant in conformation. Loop excursions emanating from the sandwich form three topologically separate--and structurally plastic--layers, topped off by the highly glycosylated gp120 outer domain. Crystal structures, cryoelectron tomograms, and interlayer chemistry were consistent with a mechanism in which the layers act as a shape-changing spacer, facilitating movement between outer domain and gp41-associated beta-sandwich and providing for conformational diversity used in immune evasion. A ""layered"" gp120 architecture thus allows movement among alternative glycoprotein conformations required for virus entry and immune evasion, whereas a beta-sandwich clamp maintains gp120-gp41 interaction and regulates gp41 transitions."
11123912,NMR structure of the N-SH2 of the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase complexed to a doubly phosphorylated peptide reveals a second phosphotyrosine binding site.,"The N-terminal src homology 2 (SH2) domain of the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) has a higher affinity for a peptide with two phosphotyrosines than for the same peptide with only one. This unexpected result was not observed for the C-terminal SH2 from the same protein. NMR structural analysis has been used to understand the behavior of the N-SH2. The structure of the free SH2 domain has been compared to that of the SH2 complexed with a doubly phosphorylated peptide derived from polyomavirus middle T antigen (MT). The structure of the free SH2 domain shows some differences from previous NMR and X-ray structures. In the N-SH2 complexed with a doubly phosphorylated peptide, a second site for phosphotyrosine interaction has been identified. Further, line shapes of NMR signals showed that the SH2 protein-ligand complex is subject to temperature-dependent conformational mobility. Conformational mobility is also supported by the spectra of the ligand peptide. A binding model which accounts for these results is developed."
21094642,Structural models of DYNLL1 with interacting partners: African swine fever virus protein p54 and postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin.,"DYNLL1, the smallest dynein light chain, interacts with different cargos facilitating their cellular transport. Usually the sequence recognized in the targets is homologous to the GIQVD or the KXTQT motifs with a glutamine that is important for binding. Here we add two new examples of DYNLL1 targets that can be classified into these two groups: ASFV p54 and gephyrin. Using NMR we demonstrate the direct interaction between DYNLL1 and two peptides derived from their interacting sequences. We model the structure of both complexes and show that the overall binding mode is preserved as in other complexes despite differences at the residue-specific interactions."
17713926,Solution structure of the hDlg/SAP97 PDZ2 domain and its mechanism of interaction with HPV-18 papillomavirus E6 protein.,"The E6 protein from high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) binds PDZ-domain containing proteins and targets them for degradation. We used isothermal titration calorimetry to measure the interaction of a peptide from the C-terminus of HPV-18 E6 to the second PDZ domain (PDZ2) from the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein (hDlg). Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments with a series of peptides showed that HPV-18 E6 bound hDlg PDZ2 about 5-fold stronger than HPV-16 E6, that the contribution of Arg154 to binding was about 1 kcal/mol, and that the binding was disabled by phosphorylation at Thr156. We then used NMR to determine the solution structure of the complex of PDZ2 bound to the HPV-18 E6 peptide. The resultant structures were of high quality and had backbone root-mean-square deviations of less than 0.5 A. The structure shows a novel mode of interaction in which six residues of the HPV-18 E6 peptide are contacted by the PDZ2 domain, in contrast to the typical four residues used by class I PDZ domains. Molecular dynamics simulations supported a model in which the C- and N-terminal ends of the peptide had different mobilities within the complex. Comparison of the NMR complex structure to previously determined X-ray structures of PDZ2 by itself and bound to different peptides allows a description of conformational changes required for PDZ2 to bind to HPV-18 E6."
17696407,The K15 protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus recruits the endocytic regulator intersectin 2 through a selective SH3 domain interaction.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, also known as human herpesvirus 8, is closely associated with several cancers including Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. The rightmost end of the KSHV genome encodes a protein, K15, with multiple membrane-spanning segments and an intracellular carboxy-terminal tail that contains several conserved motifs with the potential to recruit interaction domains (i.e., SH2, SH3, TRAF) of host cell proteins. K15 has been implicated in downregulating B cell receptor (BCR) signaling through its conserved motifs and may thereby play a role in maintaining viral latency and/or preventing apoptosis of the infected B cells. However, K15's mode of action is largely unknown. We have used mass spectrometry, domain and peptide arrays, and surface plasmon resonance to identify binding partners for a conserved proline-rich sequence (PPLP) in the K15 cytoplasmic tail. We show that the PPLP motif selectively binds the SH3-C domain of an endocytic adaptor protein, Intersectin 2 (ITSN2). This interaction can be observed both in vitro and in cells, where K15 and ITSN2 colocalize to discrete compartments within the B cell. The ability of K15 to associate with ITSN2 suggests a new role for the K15 viral protein in intracellular protein trafficking."
17681535,"Structure of CrmE, a virus-encoded tumour necrosis factor receptor.","Vaccinia virus (VACV), the smallpox vaccine, encodes many proteins that subvert the host immune response. One of these, cytokine response modifier E (CrmE), is secreted by infected cells and protects these cells from apoptotic challenge by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). We have expressed recombinant CrmE from VACV strain Lister in Escherichia coli, shown that the purified protein is monomeric in solution and competent to bind TNFalpha, and solved the structure to 2.0 A resolution. This is the first structure of a virus-encoded tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR). CrmE shares significant sequence similarity with mammalian type 2 TNF receptors (TNFSFR1B, p75; TNFR type 2). The structure confirms that CrmE adopts the canonical TNFR fold but only one of the two ""ligand-binding"" loops of TNFRSF1A is conserved in CrmE, suggesting a mechanism for the higher affinity of poxvirus TNFRs for TNFalpha over lymphotoxin-alpha. The roles of dimerisation and pre-ligand-assembly domains (PLADs) in poxvirus and mammalian TNFR activity are discussed."
16951253,Crystal structure of SV40 large T-antigen bound to p53: interplay between a viral oncoprotein and a cellular tumor suppressor.,"The transformation potential of Simian Virus 40 depends on the activities of large T-antigen (LTag), which interacts with several cellular tumor suppressors including the important ""guardian"" of the genome, p53. Inhibition of p53 function by LTag is necessary for both efficient viral replication and cellular transformation. We determined the crystal structure of LTag in complex with p53. The structure reveals an unexpected hexameric complex of LTag binding six p53 monomers. Structure-guided mutagenesis of LTag and p53 residues supported the p53-LTag interface defined by the complex structure. The structure also shows that LTag binding induces dramatic conformational changes at the DNA-binding area of p53, which is achieved partially through an unusual ""methionine switch"" within p53. In the complex structure, LTag occupies the whole p53 DNA-binding surface and likely interferes with formation of a functional p53 tetramer. In addition, we showed that p53 inhibited LTag helicase function through direct complex formation."
19581596,Model structure of APOBEC3C reveals a binding pocket modulating ribonucleic acid interaction required for encapsidation.,"Human APOBEC3 (A3) proteins form part of the intrinsic immunity to retroviruses. Carrying 1 or 2 copies of a cytidine deaminase motif, A3s act by deamination of retroviral genomes during reverse transcription. HIV-1 overcomes this inhibition by the Vif protein, which prevents incorporation of A3 into virions. In this study we modeled and probed the structure of APOBEC3C (A3C), a single-domain A3 with strong antilentiviral activity. The 3-dimensional protein model was used to predict the effect of mutations on antiviral activity, which was tested in a Deltavif simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) reporter virus assay. We found that A3C activity requires protein dimerization for antiviral activity against SIV. Furthermore, by using a structure-based algorithm for automated pocket extraction, we detected a putative substrate binding pocket of A3C distal from the zinc-coordinating deaminase motif. Mutations in this region diminished antiviral activity by excluding A3C from virions. We found evidence that the small 5.8S RNA specifically binds to this locus and mediates incorporation of A3C into virus particles."
20080767,Myelin-associated glycoprotein mediates membrane fusion and entry of neurotropic herpesviruses.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) are prevalent neurotropic herpesviruses that cause various nervous system diseases. Similar to other enveloped viruses, membrane fusion is an essential process for viral entry. Therefore, identification of host molecules that mediate membrane fusion is important to understand the mechanism of viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), mainly distributed in neural tissues, associates with VZV glycoprotein B (gB) and promotes cell-cell fusion when coexpressed with VZV gB and gH/gL. VZV preferentially infected MAG-transfected oligodendroglial cells. MAG also associated with HSV-1 gB and enhanced HSV-1 infection of promyelocytes. These findings suggested that MAG is involved in VZV and HSV infection of neural tissues."
16845370,The Yersinia enterocolitica effector YopP inhibits host cell signalling by inactivating the protein kinase TAK1 in the IL-1 signalling pathway.,"The mechanism by which YopP simultaneously inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways has been elusive. Ectopic expression of YopP inhibits the activity and ubiquitination of a complex consisting of overexpressed TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and its subunit TAK1-binding protein (TAB)1, but not of MEK kinase 1. YopP, but not the catalytically inactive mutant YopP(C172A), also suppresses basal and interleukin-1-inducible activation of endogenous TAK1, TAB1 and TAB2. YopP does not affect the interaction of TAK1, TAB1 and TAB2 but inhibits autophosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr 187 and phosphorylation of TAB1 at Ser 438. Glutathione S-transferase-tagged YopP (GST-YopP) binds to MAPK kinase (MAPKK)4 and TAB1 but not to TAK1 or TAB2 in vitro. Furthermore, YopP in synergy with a previously described negative regulatory feedback loop inhibits TAK1 by MAPKK6-p38-mediated TAB1 phosphorylation. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that YopP binds to TAB1 and directly inhibits TAK1 activity by affecting constitutive TAK1 and TAB1 ubiquitination that is required for autoactivation of TAK1."
7588762,A casein-kinase-2-related protein kinase is tightly associated with the large T antigen of simian virus 40.,"The simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen is a multifunctional protein involved in SV40 cell transformation and lytic virus infection. Some of its activities are regulated by interaction with cellular proteins and/or by phosphorylation of T antigen by various protein kinases. In this study, we show that immuno-purified T antigen from SV40-transformed cells and from baculovirus-infected insect cells is tightly associated with a protein kinase that phosphorylates T antigen in vitro. In the presence of heparin or a peptide resembling a protein kinase CK2 recognition site, the phosphorylation of T antigen by the associated kinase is reduced whereas a p34cdc2-kinase-specific peptide has no influence. In addition, the T-antigen-associated protein kinase can use GTP and ATP as phosphate donors. These properties together with the observation that immunopurified T antigen can be phosphorylated by the addition of protein kinase CK2 suggest that at least one of the T-antigen-associated protein kinases is CK2 or a protein-kinase-CK2-related enzyme. The association of recombinant CK2 with T antigen was strongly confirmed by in vitro binding studies. Experiments with temperature-sensitive SV40-transformed cells provide evidence for a close correlation between cell transformation and phosphorylation of T antigen by the associated protein kinase."
10330164,"Specificity of cyclin E-Cdk2, TFIIB, and E1A interactions with a common domain of the p300 coactivator.","The p300 and CREB binding protein (CBP) transcriptional coactivators interact with a variety of transcription factors and regulate their activity. Among the interactions that have been described, the COOH-terminal region of p300 binds to cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cyclin E-Cdk2) and TFIIB, as well as to the E1A gene products of adenovirus. Inhibition of Cdk activity by Cdk inhibitors, such as p21 or p27, potentiates NF-kappaB activity and provides a mechanism to coordinate cell cycle progression with the transcription of genes expressed during growth arrest. In this report, we analyze the specific domains of p300 required for the binding of p300 to cyclin E-Cdk2, TFIIB, and E1A and the ability of these proteins to interact with p300, alone or in combination. 12S E1A, an inhibitor of p300-dependent transcription, reduces the binding of TFIIB, but not that of cyclin E-Cdk2, to p300. In contrast, 13S E1A, a pleiotropic transcriptional activator, does not inhibit TFIIB binding to p300, although it enhances the interaction of cyclin E-Cdk2 with p300. Modification of cyclin E-Cdk2 is most likely required for association with p300 since the interaction is observed only with cyclin E-Cdk2 purified from mammalian cells. Domain swap studies show that the cyclin homology domain of TFIIB is involved in interactions with p300, although the homologous region from cyclin E does not mediate this interaction. These findings suggest that p300 or CBP function is regulated by interactions of various proteins with a common coactivator domain."
9018065,"The adenovirus 12 E1A proteins can bind directly to proteins of the p300 transcription co-activator family, including the CREB-binding protein CBP and p300.","The cellular transcription co-activators p300 and the CREB-binding protein CBP are cellular targets for transformation by the E1A proteins of non-oncogenic adenovirus 5 (Ad5). In this study, we show that the E1A proteins of oncogenic Ad12, like those of Ad5, can also bind to CBP and that this interaction is direct. In addition, we show that the Ad12 E1A proteins can also bind directly to p300. These results suggest that E1A can modulate the function of proteins of the p300 family via direct protein-protein interactions."
14978742,RACK1 is a functional target of the E1A oncoprotein.,"The adenoviral E1A proteins have been implicated in promotion of proliferation and transformation, inhibition of differentiation, induction of apoptosis, regulation of transcription, and suppression of tumor growth. The ability of E1A to override the fundamental controls of host cells is based on its ability to physically interact with several cellular proteins. We recently characterized RACK1 as a new E1A-interacting protein. In this report, we show that the extreme N-terminal region of E1A, spanning from aminoacids 1-36, and the conserved WD regions of RACK1 are responsible for this interaction. We also demonstrate that E1A and RACK1 colocalize at the perinuclear membrane in the cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that E1A is able to antagonize the inhibitory effects of RACK1 on Src activity. These results suggest that RACK1 signaling pathway may be a functional target of E1A, contributing to E1A oncogenic effect in the host cells."
10196247,Characterization of an E1A-CBP interaction defines a novel transcriptional adapter motif (TRAM) in CBP/p300.,"The adenovirus E1A protein subverts cellular processes to induce mitotic activity in quiescent cells. Important targets of E1A include members of the transcriptional adapter family containing CBP/p300. Competition for CBP/p300 binding by various cellular transcription factors has been suggested as a means of integrating different signalling pathways and may also represent a potential mechanism by which E1A manipulates cell fate. Here we describe the characterization of the interaction between E1A and the C/H3 region of CBP. We define a novel conserved 12-residue transcriptional adapter motif (TRAM) within CBP/p300 that represents the binding site for both E1A and numerous cellular transcription factors. We also identify a sequence (FPESLIL) within adenovirus E1A that is required to bind the CBP TRAM. Furthermore, an E1A peptide containing the FPESLIL sequence is capable of preventing the interaction between CBP and TRAM-binding transcription factors, such as p53, E2F, and TFIIB, thus providing a molecular model for E1A action. As an in vivo demonstration of this model, we used a small region of CBP containing a functional TRAM that can bind to the p53 protein. The CBP TRAM binds p53 sequences targeted by the cellular regulator MDM2, and we demonstrate that an MDM2-p53 interaction can be disrupted by the CBP TRAM, leading to stabilization of cellular p53 levels and the activation of p53-dependent transcription. Transcriptional activation of p53 by the CBP TRAM is abolished by wild-type E1A but not by a CBP-binding-deficient E1A mutant."
10327051,The N-terminal transactivation domain of ATF2 is a target for the co-operative activation of the c-jun promoter by p300 and 12S E1A.,"The adenovirus E1A proteins activate the c-jun promoter through two Jun/ATF-binding sites, jun1 and jun2. P300, a transcriptional coactivator of several AP1 and ATF transcription factors has been postulated to play a role in this activation. Here, we present evidence that p300 can control c-jun transcription by acting as a cofactor for ATF2: (1) Over-expression of p300 was found to stimulate c-jun transcription both in the presence and absence of E1A. (2) Like E1A, p300 activates the c-jun promoter through the junl and jun2 elements and preferentially activates the N-terminal domain of ATF2. (3) Co-immunoprecipitation assays of crude cell extracts indicate that endogenous p300/CBP(-like) proteins and ATF2 proteins are present in a multiprotein complex that can bind specifically to the jun2 element. We further demonstrate that the Stress-Activated-Protein-Kinase (SAPK) target sites of ATF2, Thr69 and Thr71 are not required for the formation of the p300/CBP-ATF2 multiprotein complex. These data indicate that E1A does not inhibit all transcription activation functions of p300, and, in fact, cooperates with p300 in the activation of the ATF2 N-terminus."
14527689,Adenovirus 2 E1B-55K protein relieves p53-mediated transcriptional repression of the survivin and MAP4 promoters.,"It is well established that adenovirus E1B-55K protein functions as an inhibitor of the tumor suppressor protein p53 by binding and inactivating p53 as a transcriptional activator protein. Here we show that the adenovirus 2 E1B-55K protein also blocks p53 as a transcriptional repressor protein of the survivin and the MAP4 promoters. The repression is dependent on the ability of E1B-55K to bind to p53 and is enhanced by coexpression of the adenovirus E4orf6 protein. Overexpression of the transcriptional corepressor protein Sin3A partially relieves the inhibitory effect of E1B-55K, suggesting that E1B-55K blocks p53 functions by interfering with the Sin3 complex."
9857076,Identification of structural elements involved in the interaction of simian virus 40 small tumor antigen with protein phosphatase 2A.,"SV40 small tumor antigen (small-t) was used as a model to identify structural elements involved in the interactions between regulatory proteins and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Using mutant proteins and synthetic peptides, we identified a small domain within small-t that is a major site for interaction with the dimeric form of PP2A. A series of small-t truncation mutants identified a region surrounding the first of two conserved cysteine clusters that was critical for interaction with PP2A. These mutants also identified additional regions of small-t that contribute to high affinity interaction. Deletion of residues 110-119, which encompass the first cysteine cluster, resulted in a protein that failed to bind to PP2A. Synthetic peptides that contained residues 105-122 of small-t blocked binding of small-t to PP2A. These peptides also inhibited the phosphatase activity of PP2A in a manner analogous to full-length small-t. The active small-t peptides adopt a beta-strand structure that was essential for high affinity interaction with the PP2A dimer. Based on circular dichroism measurements, the same cysteine cluster-containing peptides that bind to PP2A also interact with zinc. Interaction with zinc required the conserved cysteines but was not required for interaction with PP2A."
15669058,Association of cottontail rabbit papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins with the hDlg/SAP97 tumor suppressor.,"Papillomaviruses are small DNA viruses that infect epithelial tissues and cause warts. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the primary risk factor for the development of cervical cancer. The E6 and E7 oncogenes are the only genes consistently expressed in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells. Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) induces papillomas and carcinomas on cottontail and domestic rabbits and provides an excellent animal model of HPV infection and vaccine development. CRPV encodes three transforming proteins; LE6, SE6, and E7. Each of these proteins is required for papilloma formation. Like HPV E7, the CRPV E7 protein binds to the tumor suppressor pRB. In contrast, unlike HPV E6, the CRPV E6 proteins do not bind the tumor suppressor p53. Although more than a dozen cellular proteins have been identified as HPV E6 interacting proteins, nothing is known about the cellular interacting proteins of CRPV E6s. Here we describe the association of CRPV E6s with hDlg/SAP97, the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein. HPV E6 has previously shown to bind and target hDlg/SAP97 for degradation. Our results demonstrate that both LE6 and SE6 interact with hDlg/SAP97, although their association does not lead to the degradation of hDlg/SAP97. The PDZ domains of hDlg were shown to be sufficient for interaction with CRPV E6 proteins while the C-terminus of CRPV E6 is essential for the interaction with hDlg. The association of hDlg with SE6 may be important but not sufficient for the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by SE6. Importantly, a CRPV SE6 mutant defective for papilloma formation did not interact with hDlg. These results suggest that interaction with hDlg/SAP97 plays a role in the biological function of CRPV E6s."
17341466,Involvement of chromatin and histone deacetylation in SV40 T antigen transcription regulation.,"Simian Virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (T Ag) is a multifunctional viral oncoprotein that regulates viral and cellular transcriptional activity. However, the mechanisms by which such regulation occurs remain unclear. Here we show that T antigen represses CBP-mediated transcriptional activity. This repression is concomitant with histone H3 deacetylation and is TSA sensitive. Moreover, our results demonstrate that T antigen interacts with HDAC1 in vitro in an Rb-independent manner. In addition, the overexpression of HDAC1 cooperates with T antigen to antagonize CBP transactivation function and correlates with chromatin deacetylation of the TK promoter. Finally, decreasing HDAC1 levels with small interfering RNA (siRNA) partially abolishes T antigen-induced repression. These findings highlight the importance of the histone acetylation/deacetylation balance in the cellular transformation mediated by oncoviral proteins."
20708612,"DJ-1, an oncogene and causative gene for familial Parkinson's disease, is essential for SV40 transformation in mouse fibroblasts through up-regulation of c-Myc.","Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a tumor virus and its early gene product large T-antigen (LT) is responsible for the transforming activity of SV40. Parkinson's disease causative gene DJ-1 is also a ras-dependent oncogene, but the mechanism of its oncogene function is still not known. In this study, we found that there were no transformed foci when fibroblasts from DJ-1-knockout mice were transfected with LT. We also found that DJ-1 directly bound to LT and that the expression level of c-Myc in transformed cells was parallel to that of DJ-1. These findings indicate that DJ-1 is essential for SV40 transformation."
11251081,"Interaction of the E1A oncoprotein with Yak1p, a novel regulator of yeast pseudohyphal differentiation, and related mammalian kinases.","The C-terminal portion of adenovirus E1A suppresses ras-induced metastasis and tumorigenicity in mammalian cells; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which this occurs. In the simple eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ras2p, the homolog of mammalian h-ras, regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling pathways to control differentiation from the yeast form to the pseudohyphal form. When expressed in yeast, the C-terminal region of E1A induced pseudohyphal differentiation, and this was independent of both the MAPK and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified an interaction between the C-terminal region of E1A and Yak1p, a yeast dual-specificity serine/threonine protein kinase that functions as a negative regulator of growth. E1A also physically interacts with Dyrk1A and Dyrk1B, two mammalian homologs of Yak1p, and stimulates their kinase activity in vitro. We further demonstrate that Yak1p is required in yeast to mediate pseudohyphal differentiation induced by Ras2p-regulated signaling pathways. However, pseudohyphal differentiation induced by the C-terminal region of E1A is largely independent of Yak1p. These data suggest that mammalian Yak1p-related kinases may be targeted by the E1A oncogene to modulate cell growth."
19555689,"MCC, a new interacting protein for Scrib, is required for cell migration in epithelial cells.","To further characterize the molecular events supporting the tumor suppressor activity of Scrib in mammals, we aim to identify new binding partners. We isolated MCC, a recently identified binding partner for beta-catenin, as a new interacting protein for Scrib. MCC interacts with both Scrib and the NHERF1/NHERF2/Ezrin complex in a PDZ-dependent manner. In T47D cells, MCC and Scrib proteins colocalize at the cell membrane and reduced expression of MCC results in impaired cell migration. By contrast to Scrib, MCC inhibits cell directed migration independently of Rac1, Cdc42 and PAK activation. Altogether, these results identify MCC as a potential scaffold protein regulating cell movement and able to bind Scrib, beta-catenin and NHERF1/2."
20075863,A viral E3 ligase targets RNF8 and RNF168 to control histone ubiquitination and DNA damage responses.,"The ICP0 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and transactivator required for the efficient switch between latent and lytic infection. As DNA damaging treatments are known to reactivate latent virus, we wished to explore whether ICP0 modulates the cellular response to DNA damage. We report that ICP0 prevents accumulation of repair factors at cellular damage sites, acting between recruitment of the mediator proteins Mdc1 and 53BP1. We identify RNF8 and RNF168, cellular histone ubiquitin ligases responsible for anchoring repair factors at sites of damage, as new targets for ICP0-mediated degradation. By targeting these ligases, ICP0 expression results in loss of ubiquitinated forms of H2A, mobilization of DNA repair proteins and enhanced viral fitness. Our study raises the possibility that the ICP0-mediated control of histone ubiquitination may link DNA repair, relief of transcriptional repression, and activation of latent viral genomes."
17360743,The E1circumflexE4 protein of human papillomavirus interacts with the serine-arginine-specific protein kinase SRPK1.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections of the squamous epithelium are associated with high-level expression of the E1circumflexE4 protein during the productive phase of infection. However, the precise mechanisms of how E1circumflexE4 contributes to the replication cycle of the virus are poorly understood. Here, we show that the serine-arginine (SR)-specific protein kinase SRPK1 is a novel binding partner of HPV type 1 (HPV1) E1circumflexE4. We map critical residues within an arginine-rich domain of HPV1 E1circumflexE4, and in a region known to facilitate E1circumflexE4 oligomerization, that are requisite for SRPK1 binding. In vitro kinase assays show that SRPK1 binding is associated with phosphorylation of an HPV1 E1circumflexE4 polypeptide and modulates autophosphorylation of the kinase. We show that SRPK1 is sequestered into E4 inclusion bodies in terminally differentiated cells within HPV1 warts and that colocalization between E1circumflexE4 and SRPK1 is not dependent on additional HPV1 factors. Moreover, we also identify SRPK1 binding of E1circumflexE4 proteins of HPV16 and HPV18. Our findings indicate that SRPK1 binding is a conserved function of E1circumflexE4 proteins of diverse virus types. SRPK1 influences important biochemical processes within the cell, including nuclear organization and RNA metabolism. While phosphorylation of HPV1 E4 by SRPK1 may directly influence HPV1 E4 function during the infectious cycle, the modulation and sequestration of SRPK1 by E1circumflexE4 may affect the ability of SRPK1 to phosphorylate its cellular targets, thereby facilitating the productive phase of the HPV replication cycle."
15582666,Proteins of the PIAS family enhance the sumoylation of the papillomavirus E1 protein.,"Sumoylation of the papillomavirus (PV) origin binding helicase E1 protein is critical for its function. Consequently, factors modulating the sumoylation of E1 could ultimately alter the outcome of a papillomavirus infection. We investigated the role played by phosphorylation and two known SUMO E3 ligases, RanBP2 and PIAS proteins, on the sumoylation of E1. E1 sumoylation was unaffected by phosphorylation as both wild-type and pseudo-phosphorylation mutants of BPV E1 exhibited similar sumoylation profiles. RanBP2 bound to BPV E1, but not to HPV11 E1, and lacked sumoylation enhancing activity for either E1. In contrast, proteins of the PIAS family (except PIASy) bound to both BPV and HPV11 E1 and stimulated their sumoylation. The structural integrity of the RING finger domain of the PIAS proteins was required for their E3 SUMO ligase activity on PV E1 sumoylation but was dispensable for their PV E1 binding activity. Miz1, the PIAS protein exerting the strongest E1 sumoylation enhancing activity, favored SUMO1 versus SUMO2 as the modifier and was shown to be transcribed in a keratinocyte cell line. This study indicates PIAS proteins as possible modulators of PV E1 sumoylation during papillomavirus infections."
15140953,Conformational changes in the nuclear lamina induced by herpes simplex virus type 1 require genes U(L)31 and U(L)34.,"The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) U(L)31 and U(L)34 proteins are dependent on each other for proper targeting to the nuclear membrane and are required for efficient envelopment of nucleocapsids at the inner nuclear membrane. In this work, we show that whereas the solubility of lamins A and C (lamin A/C) was not markedly increased, HSV induced conformational changes in the nuclear lamina of infected cells, as viewed after staining with three different lamin A/C-specific antibodies. In one case, reactivity with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope in the lamin tail domain was greatly reduced in HSV-infected cells. This apparent HSV-induced epitope masking required both U(L)31 and U(L)34, but these proteins were not sufficient to mask the epitope in uninfected cells, indicating that other HSV proteins are also required. In the second case, staining with a rabbit polyclonal antibody that primarily recognizes epitopes in the lamin A/C rod domain revealed that U(L)34 is required for HSV-induced decreased availability of epitopes for reaction with the antibody, whereas U(L)31 protein was dispensable for this effect. Still another polyclonal antibody indicated virtually no difference in lamin A/C staining in infected versus uninfected cells, indicating that the HSV-induced changes are more conformational than the result of lamin depletion at the nuclear rim. Further evidence supporting an interaction between the nuclear lamina and the U(L)31/U(L)34 protein complex includes the observations that (i) overexpression of the U(L)31 protein in uninfected cells was sufficient to relocalize lamin A/C from the nuclear rim into nucleoplasmic aggregates, (ii) overexpression of U(L)34 was sufficient to relocalize some lamin A/C into the cytoplasm, and (iii) both U(L)31 and U(L)34 could directly bind lamin A/C in vitro. These studies suggest that the U(L)31 and U(L)34 proteins modify the conformation of the nuclear lamina in infected cells, possibly by direct interaction with lamin A/C, and that other proteins are also likely involved. Given that the nuclear lamina potentially excludes nucleocapsids from envelopment sites at the inner nuclear membrane, the lamina alteration may reflect a role of the U(L)31/U(L)34 protein complex in perturbing the lamina to promote nucleocapsid egress from the nucleus. Alternatively, the data are compatible with a role of the lamina in targeting the U(L)31/U(L)34 protein complex to the nuclear membrane."
10982355,Adeno-associated virus type 2 rep protein inhibits human papillomavirus type 16 E2 recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator p300.,"Infection by human adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) is a possible protective factor in the development of cervical carcinomas associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV). The replicative proteins of AAV2 (Rep) have been implicated in the inhibition of papillomavirus replication and transforming activities, although the molecular events underlying these effects are poorly understood. We observed that each of the four forms of AAV2 Rep inhibited the E1- and E2-driven replication of oncogenic HPV type 16 (HPV16). Rep40, corresponding to the C-terminal domain of all Rep proteins, inhibited both HPV DNA replication and HPV16 E2-mediated transactivation. Rep40 specifically bound the N-terminal transactivation domain of HPV16 E2 both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction was found to specifically disrupt the binding of E2 to the cellular transcriptional coactivator p300. Accordingly, the inhibitory effect of Rep on HPV16 E2 transactivation was rescued by the overexpression of p300. These data indicate a novel role of Rep in the down-regulation of papillomaviruses through inhibition of complex formation between the HPV16 E2 transcriptional activator and its cellular coactivator, p300."
1870208,Purification and characterization of human papillomavirus type 16 E7 protein with preferential binding capacity to the underphosphorylated form of retinoblastoma gene product.,"Human papillomavirus type 16 E7 is considered to be a major viral oncoprotein playing an important role(s) in cervical cancers. E7 protein was shown to bind to the protein product of the retinoblastoma gene (RB), while simian virus 40 large T and adenovirus E1A were also shown to possess binding activity to RB protein. The RB protein is a cell cycle regulator that is highly phosphorylated specifically in S, G2, and M, whereas it is underphosphorylated in G0 and G1. Recently, large T was demonstrated to bind preferentially to the underphosphorylated RB protein, which is considered to be an active form restricting cell proliferation. However, it is not known whether E7 can bind to phosphorylated RB protein. We successfully purified large quantities of unfused human papillomavirus type 16 E7 protein expressed in Escherichia coli by using a T7 promoter-T7 RNA polymerase system. The purified E7 protein was demonstrated to bind preferentially to the underphosphorylated RB protein."
18301737,The Gammaherpesvirus m2 protein manipulates the Fyn/Vav pathway through a multidocking mechanism of assembly.,"To establish latent infections in B-cells, gammaherpesviruses express proteins in the infected B-cells of the host that spuriously activate signalling pathways located downstream of the B-cell receptor. One such protein is M2, a murine gammaherpesvirus 68-encoded molecule that activates the Vav1/Rac1 pathway via the formation of trimolecular complexes with Scr family members. Previous reports have shown that the formation of this heteromolecular complex involves interactions between a proline rich region of M2 and the Vav1 and Fyn SH3 domains. Here, we show that the optimal association of these proteins requires a second structural motif encompassing two tyrosine residues (Tyr120 and 129). These residues are inducibly phosphorylated by Fyn in non-hematopoietic cells and constitutively phosphorylated in B-cells. We also demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Tyr120 creates specific docking sites for the SH2 domains of both Vav1 and Fyn, a condition sine qua non for the optimal association of these two signalling proteins in vivo. Interestingly, signaling experiments indicate that the expression of M2 in B-cells promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 and additional signaling proteins, a biological process that requires the integrity of both the M2 phosphotyrosine and proline rich region motifs. By infecting mice with viruses mutated in the m2 locus, we show that the integrity of each of these two M2 docking motifs is essential for the early steps of murine gammaherpesvirus-68 latency. Taken together, these results indicate that the M2 phosphotyrosine motif and the previously described M2 proline rich region work in a concerted manner to manipulate the signaling machinery of the host B-cell."
11238845,Vaccinia virus blocks gamma interferon signal transduction: viral VH1 phosphatase reverses Stat1 activation.,"We have analyzed the effects of vaccinia virus (VV) on gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) signal transduction. Infection of cells with VV 1 to 2 h prior to treatment with IFN-gamma inhibits phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat1 and consequently blocks accumulation of mRNAs normally induced by IFN-gamma. While phosphorylation of other proteins in the IFN-gamma pathway was not affected, activation of Stat1 by other ligand-receptor systems was also blocked by VV. This block of Stat1 activation was dose dependent, and although viral protein synthesis was not required, entry and uncoating of viral cores appear to be needed to block the accumulation of phosphorylated Stat1. These results suggest that a virion component is responsible for the effect. VV virions contain a phosphatase (VH1) that is sensitive to the phosphatase inhibitor Na(3)VO(4) but not to okadaic acid. Addition of Na(3)VO(4) but not okadaic acid restored normal Stat1 phosphorylation levels in VV-infected cells. Moreover, virions containing reduced levels of VH1 were unable to block the IFN-gamma signaling pathway. In vitro studies show that the phosphatase can bind and dephosphorylate Stat1, indicating that this transcription factor can be a substrate for VH1. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which VV interferes with the onset of host immune responses by blocking the IFN-gamma signal cascade through the dephosphorylating activity of the viral phosphatase VH1."
17170431,Influenza A virus NS1 protein activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway by direct interaction with the p85 subunit of PI3K.,"Influenza A virus infection activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, but the mechanism is not clear. Here, it is reported that influenza A virus NS1 protein is responsible for PI3K/Akt pathway activation. It was demonstrated that the NS1 protein interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K via direct binding to the SH3 and C-terminal SH2 domains of p85. Consensus binding motifs for SH3 and SH2 domains were found in influenza A virus NS1, namely an SH2-binding motif (YXXXM) at aa 89, SH3-binding motif 1 (PXXP) around aa 164 and SH3-binding motif 2 around aa 212. Mutant virus encoding NS1 protein with mutations in the SH-binding motifs failed to interact with SH domains of p85 and did not activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. The mutant virus is attenuated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Our study has established a novel function of NS1: by interacting with p85 via the SH-binding motifs, NS1 can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway."
10814581,Competitive binding to a charged leucine motif represses transformation by a papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein.,"E6 oncoproteins from HPV-16 and bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) bind to similar leucine-rich peptides termed charged leucine motifs found on the cellular focal adhesion protein paxillin and the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP. BPV-1 E6 (BE6) mutants that do not bind to paxillin are defective at inducing cellular transformation. It is possible, however, that BE6 mutants that do not bind paxillin are defective for transformation for an unrelated reason than the ability to bind to charged leucine motifs. To address the role of BE6 interaction with charged leucine motifs, we fused a BE6-binding charged leucine motif to the amino terminus of BE6, thereby creating an autoinhibitory binding domain. We found that the fusion protein failed to bind to paxillin or transform murine C127 cells. Mutation of the amino terminal binding motif in the fusion protein restored both interaction with paxillin and transformation. This demonstrates that BE6 transformation requires binding to charged leucine motifs on particular cellular proteins and that transformation by papillomavirus oncoproteins can be repressed by competitive interactions with charged leucine motifs."
21915095,A kinesin-1 binding motif in vaccinia virus that is widespread throughout the human genome.,"Transport of cargoes by kinesin-1 is essential for many cellular processes. Nevertheless, the number of proteins known to recruit kinesin-1 via its cargo binding light chain (KLC) is still quite small. We also know relatively little about the molecular features that define kinesin-1 binding. We now show that a bipartite tryptophan-based kinesin-1 binding motif, originally identified in Calsyntenin is present in A36, a vaccinia integral membrane protein. This bipartite motif in A36 is required for kinesin-1-dependent transport of the virus to the cell periphery. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that related bipartite tryptophan-based motifs are present in over 450 human proteins. Using vaccinia as a surrogate cargo, we show that regions of proteins containing this motif can function to recruit KLC and promote virus transport in the absence of A36. These proteins interact with the kinesin light chain outside the context of infection and have distinct preferences for KLC1 and KLC2. Our observations demonstrate that KLC binding can be conferred by a common set of features that are found in a wide range of proteins associated with diverse cellular functions and human diseases."
19419567,Distinct phosphorylation requirements regulate cortactin activation by TirEPEC and its binding to N-WASP.,"Cortactin activates the actin-related 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex promoting actin polymerization to remodel cell architecture in multiple processes (e.g. cell migration, membrane trafficking, invadopodia formation etc.). Moreover, it was called the Achilles' heel of the actin cytoskeleton because many pathogens hijack signals that converge on this oncogenic scaffolding protein. Cortactin is able to modulate N-WASP activation in vitro in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion. Thus Erk-phosphorylated cortactin is efficient in activating N-WASP through its SH3 domain, while Src-phosphorylated cortactin is not. This could represent a switch on/off mechanism controlling the coordinated action of both nucleator promoting factors (NPFs). Pedestal formation by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) requires N-WASP activation. N-WASP is recruited by the cell adapter Nck which binds a major tyrosine-phosphorylated site of a bacterial injected effector, Tir (translocated intimin receptor). Tir-Nck-N-WASP axis defines the current major pathway to actin polymerization on pedestals. In addition, it was recently reported that EPEC induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin."
17166906,Degradation of tyrosine phosphatase PTPN3 (PTPH1) by association with oncogenic human papillomavirus E6 proteins.,"Oncoproteins from DNA tumor viruses associate with critical cellular proteins to regulate cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoproteins have been previously shown to associate with a cellular HECT domain ubiquitin ligase termed E6AP (UBE3A). Here we show that the E6-E6AP complex associates with and targets the degradation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN3 (PTPH1) in vitro and in living cells. PTPN3 is a membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase with FERM, PDZ, and PTP domains previously implicated in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of growth factor receptors and p97 VCP (valosin-containing protein, termed Cdc48 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and is mutated in a subset of colon cancers. Degradation of PTPN3 by E6 requires E6AP, the proteasome, and an interaction between the carboxy terminus of E6 and the PDZ domain of PTPN3. In transduced keratinocytes, E6 confers reduced growth factor requirements, a function that requires the PDZ ligand of E6 and that can in part be replicated by inhibiting the expression of PTPN3. This report demonstrates the potential of E6 to regulate phosphotyrosine metabolism through the targeted degradation of a tyrosine phosphatase."
21217642,Substrate recognition by complement convertases revealed in the C5-cobra venom factor complex.,"Complement acts as a danger-sensing system in the innate immune system, and its activation initiates a strong inflammatory response and cleavage of the proteins C3 and C5 by proteolytic enzymes, the convertases. These contain a non-catalytic substrate contacting subunit (C3b or C4b) in complex with a protease subunit (Bb or C2a). We determined the crystal structures of the C3b homologue cobra venom factor (CVF) in complex with C5, and in complex with C5 and the inhibitor SSL7 at 4.3 Å resolution. The structures reveal a parallel two-point attachment between C5 and CVF, where the presence of SSL7 only slightly affects the C5-CVF interface, explaining the IgA dependence for SSL7-mediated inhibition of C5 cleavage. CVF functions as a relatively rigid binding scaffold inducing a conformational change in C5, which positions its cleavage site in proximity to the serine protease Bb. A general model for substrate recognition by the convertases is presented based on the C5-CVF and C3b-Bb-SCIN structures. Prior knowledge concerning interactions between the endogenous convertases and their substrates is rationalized by this model."
17166913,Vaccinia virus 4c (A26L) protein on intracellular mature virus binds to the extracellular cellular matrix laminin.,"Vaccinia virus intracellular mature virus (IMV) binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on cells via three virion proteins, H3L, A27L, and D8L. In this study, we demonstrated that binding of IMV to BSC40 cells was competitively inhibited by soluble laminin but not by fibronectin or collagen V, suggesting that this cell surface extracellular matrix (ECM) protein may play a role in vaccinia virus entry. Moreover, IMV infection of GAG(-) sog9 cells was also inhibited by laminin, demonstrating that virion binding to laminin does not involve a prior interaction with GAGs. Furthermore, comparative envelope protein analyses of wild-type vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve, which binds to laminin, and of a mutant virus, IA27L, which does not, showed that the A26L open reading frame (ORF), encoding an envelope protein, was mutated in IA27L, resulting in A26L being absent from the IMV. Expression of the wild-type A26L ORF in IA27L resulted in laminin binding activity. Moreover, recombinant A26L protein bound to laminin in vitro with a high affinity, providing direct evidence that A26L is the laminin binding protein on IMV. In summary, these results reveal a novel role for the vaccinia viral envelope protein A26L in binding to the ECM protein laminin, an association that is proposed to facilitate IMV entry."
18208323,"Structure and function of A41, a vaccinia virus chemokine binding protein.","The vaccinia virus (VACV) A41L gene encodes a secreted 30 kDa glycoprotein that is nonessential for virus replication but affects the host response to infection. The A41 protein shares sequence similarity with another VACV protein that binds CC chemokines (called vCKBP, or viral CC chemokine inhibitor, vCCI), and strains of VACV lacking the A41L gene induced stronger CD8+ T-cell responses than control viruses expressing A41. Using surface plasmon resonance, we screened 39 human and murine chemokines and identified CCL21, CCL25, CCL26 and CCL28 as A41 ligands, with Kds of between 8 nM and 118 nM. Nonetheless, A41 was ineffective at inhibiting chemotaxis induced by these chemokines, indicating it did not block the interaction of these chemokines with their receptors. However the interaction of A41 and chemokines was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by heparin, suggesting that A41 and heparin bind to overlapping sites on these chemokines. To better understand the mechanism of action of A41 its crystal structure was solved to 1.9 A resolution. The protein has a globular beta sandwich structure similar to that of the poxvirus vCCI family of proteins, but there are notable structural differences, particularly in surface loops and electrostatic charge distribution. Structural modelling suggests that the binding paradigm as defined for the vCCI-chemokine interaction is likely to be conserved between A41 and its chemokine partners. Additionally, sequence analysis of chemokines binding to A41 identified a signature for A41 binding. The biological and structural data suggest that A41 functions by forming moderately strong (nM) interactions with certain chemokines, sufficient to interfere with chemokine-glycosaminoglycan interactions at the cell surface (microM-nM) and thereby to destroy the chemokine concentration gradient, but not strong enough to disrupt the (pM) chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions."
15890204,Kinetic analysis of the interactions of human papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins with the ubiquitin ligase E6AP using surface plasmon resonance.,"Cervical cancers evolve from lesions generated by genital human papillomaviruses (HPV). ""Low-risk"" genital HPVs cause benign proliferations whereas ""high-risk"" types have the potential to progress into cancer. High-risk HPV E6 oncoproteins interact with the ubiquitin ligase E6AP and target several cellular proteins, including p53 and proteins of the MAGI family, towards ubiquitin-mediated degradation. E6AP, like other E6 binding proteins such as E6BP, IRF-3 and paxillin, interacts with E6 via a consensus leucine-charged motif. Here we have investigated the kinetics of the interactions of a 15-mer peptide containing the LxxvarphiLsh motif of E6AP with E6. For this we have developed a Biacore assay based on antibody-capture on the sensor surface of GST- and/or MBP-E6AP peptide constructs followed by E6 protein injection. Our experiments show that E6 oncoproteins from four major high-risk (16, 18, 33 and 58) HPV types bind to E6AP with equilibrium dissociation constants in the low micromolar range. The kinetic dissociation parameters of these interactions are remarkably similar. On the other hand, low-risk HPV 11 E6 does not interact with E6AP even at relatively high concentrations. We also show that the two zinc-binding domains of E6 are required for E6AP recognition. Finally, we have analysed the binding properties of site-directed mutants of the E6AP-derived peptide. We demonstrate the importance for binding of conserved aliphatic side-chains and the moderate role of the global negative charge of the peptide. This work provides the first quantitative data on an HPV E6-mediated interaction, which support the current models of E6AP-mediated degradation."
17267502,Structures of a human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 polypeptide bound to MAGUK proteins: mechanisms of targeting tumor suppressors by a high-risk HPV oncoprotein.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoprotein targets certain tumor suppressors such as MAGI-1 and SAP97/hDlg for degradation. A short peptide at the C terminus of E6 interacts specifically with the PDZ domains of these tumor suppressors, which is a property unique to high-risk HPVs that are associated with cervical cancer. The detailed recognition mechanisms between HPV E6 and PDZ proteins are unclear. To understand the specific binding of cellular PDZ substrates by HPV E6, we have solved the crystal structures of the complexes containing a peptide from HPV18 E6 bound to three PDZ domains from MAGI-1 and SAP97/Dlg. The complex crystal structures reveal novel features of PDZ peptide recognition that explain why high-risk HPV E6 can specifically target these cellular tumor suppressors for destruction. Moreover, a new peptide-binding loop on these PDZs is identified as interacting with the E6 peptide. Furthermore, we have identified an arginine residue, unique to high-risk HPV E6 but outside the canonical core PDZ recognition motif, that plays an important role in the binding of the PDZs of both MAGI-I and SAP97/Dlg, the mutation of which abolishes E6's ability to degrade the two proteins. Finally, we have identified a dimer form of MAGI-1 PDZ domain 1 in the cocrystal structure with E6 peptide, which may have functional relevance for MAGI-1 activity. In addition to its novel insights into the biochemistry of PDZ interactions, this study is important for understanding HPV-induced oncogenesis; this could provide a basis for developing antiviral and anticancer compounds."
20051244,A subunit of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase stabilizes octaprenyl diphosphate synthase in Escherichia coli by forming a high-molecular weight complex.,"The length of the isoprenoid-side chain in ubiquinone, an essential component of the electron transport chain, is defined by poly-prenyl diphosphate synthase, which comprises either homomers (e.g., IspB in Escherichia coli) or heteromers (e.g., decaprenyl diphosphate synthase (Dps1) and D-less polyprenyl diphosphate synthase (Dlp1) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and in humans). We found that expression of either dlp1 or dps1 recovered the thermo-sensitive growth of an E. coli ispB(R321A) mutant and restored IspB activity and production of Coenzyme Q-8. IspB interacted with Dlp1 (or Dps1), forming a high-molecular weight complex that stabilized IspB, leading to full functionality."
1706474,Control of protein phosphatase 2A by simian virus 40 small-t antigen.,"Soluble, monomeric simian virus 40 (SV40) small-t antigen (small-t) was purified from bacteria and assayed for its ability to form complexes with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and to modify its catalytic activity. Different forms of purified PP2A, composed of combinations of regulatory subunits (A and B) with a common catalytic subunit (C), were used. The forms used included free A and C subunits and AC and ABC complexes. Small-t associated with both the free A subunit and the AC form of PP2A, resulting in a shift in mobility during nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Small-t did not interact with the free C subunit or the ABC form. These data demonstrate that the primary interaction is between small-t and the A subunit and that the B subunit of PP2A blocks interaction of small-t with the AC form. The effect of small-t on phosphatase activity was determined by using several exogenous substrates, including myosin light chains phosphorylated by myosin light-chain kinase, myelin basic protein phosphorylated by microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase/ERK1, and histone H1 phosphorylated by protein kinase C. With the exception of histone H1, small-t inhibited the dephosphorylation of these substrates by the AC complex. With histone H1, a small stimulation of dephosphorylation by AC was observed. Small-t had no effect on the activities of free C or the ABC complex. A maximum of 50 to 75% inhibition was obtained, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 10 to 20 nM small-t. The specific activity of the small-t/AC complex was similar to that of the ABC form of PP2A with myosin light chains or histone H1 as the substrate. These results suggested that small-t and the B subunit have similar qualitative and quantitative effects on PP2A enzyme activity. These data show that SV40 small-antigen binds to purified PP2A in vitro, through interaction with the A subunit, and that this interaction inhibits enzyme activity."
9168958,"Cloning of a cDNA encoding a novel importin-alpha homologue, Qip1: discrimination of Qip1 and Rch1 from hSrp1 by their ability to interact with DNA helicase Q1/RecQL.","We isolated two cDNA clones encoding human proteins which interact with DNA helicase Q1/RecQL, a human homologue of Eschelichia coli RecQ protein, by two-hybrid screening. One of these proteins, named Qip1, was a novel protein homologous to the nuclear localization signal (NLS) receptor importin-alpha, and the other was the known protein Rch1, which is also a homologue of importin-alpha. DNA helicase Q1 in human cell lysates was coprecipitated with bacterially expressed Qip1 and Rch1 fused with glutathione-S-transferase with glutathione Sepharose beads, confirming the interaction between these proteins and DNA helicase Q1. Two-hybrid experiments revealed that Qip1 interacted with the NLS of SV40 T antigen similar to Rch1 and hSrp1. In addition, interaction of the putative NLS in DNA helicase Q1 with Qip1 and Rch1 but not with hSrp1 was confirmed by the two-hybrid system."
10799598,Topoisomerase I associates specifically with simian virus 40 large-T-antigen double hexamer-origin complexes.,"Topoisomerase I (topo I) is required for releasing torsional stress during simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication. Recently, it has been demonstrated that topo I participates in initiation of replication as well as in elongation. Although T antigen and topo I can bind to one another in vitro, there is no direct evidence that topo I is a component of the replication initiation complex. We demonstrate in this report that topo I associates with T-antigen double hexamers bound to SV40 origin DNA (T(DH)) but not to single hexamers. This association has the same nucleotide and DNA requirements as those for the formation of double hexamers on DNA. Interestingly, topo I prefers to bind to fully formed T(DH) complexes over other oligomerized forms of T antigen associated with the origin. High ratios of topo I to origin DNA destabilize T(DH). The partial unwinding of a small-circular-DNA substrate is dependent on the presence of both T antigen and topo I but is inhibited at high topo I concentrations. Competition experiments with a topo I-binding fragment of T antigen indicate that an interaction between T antigen and topo I occurs during the unwinding reaction. We propose that topo I is recruited to the initiation complex after the assembly of T(DH) and before unwinding to facilitate DNA replication."
19740108,Completing the hypusine pathway in Plasmodium.,"In searching for new targets for antimalarials we investigated the biosynthesis of hypusine present in eukaryotic initiation factor-5A (eIF-5A) in Plasmodium. Here, we describe the cloning and expression of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH), which completes the modification of eIF-5A through hydroxylation of deoxyhypusine. The dohh cDNA sequence revealed an ORF of 1236 bp encoding a protein of 412 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46.45 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.96. Interestingly, DOHH from Plasmodium has a FASTA SCORE of only 27 compared with its human ortholog and contains several matches similar to E-Z-type HEAT-like repeat proteins (IPR004155 (InterPro), PF03130 (Pfam), SM00567 (SMART) present in the phycocyanin lyase subunits of cyanobacteria. Purified DOHH protein displayed hydroxylase activity in a novel in vitro DOHH assay, but phycocyanin lyase activity was absent. dohh is present as a single-copy gene and is transcribed in the asexual blood stages of the parasite. A signal peptide at the N-terminus might direct the protein to a different cellular compartment. During evolution, Plasmodium falciparum acquired an apicoplast that lost its photosynthetic function. It is possible that plasmodial DOHH arose from an E/F-type phycobilin lyase that gained a new role in hydroxylation.

19197236,Mislocalization of the MRN complex prevents ATR signaling during adenovirus infection.,"The protein kinases ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM-Rad3 related (ATR) are activated in response to DNA damage, genotoxic stress and virus infections. Here we show that during infection with wild-type adenovirus, ATR and its cofactors RPA32, ATRIP and TopBP1 accumulate at viral replication centres, but there is minimal ATR activation. We show that the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex is recruited to viral centres only during infection with adenoviruses lacking the early region E4 and ATR signaling is activated. This suggests a novel requirement for the MRN complex in ATR activation during virus infection, which is independent of Mre11 nuclease activity and recruitment of RPA/ATR/ATRIP/TopBP1. Unlike other damage scenarios, we found that ATM and ATR signaling are not dependent on each other during infection. We identify a region of the viral E4orf3 protein responsible for immobilization of the MRN complex and show that this prevents ATR signaling during adenovirus infection. We propose that immobilization of the MRN damage sensor by E4orf3 protein prevents recognition of viral genomes and blocks detrimental aspects of checkpoint signaling during virus infection."
20828568,MEGF10 functions as a receptor for the uptake of amyloid-β.,"MEGF10 is predominantly expressed in the brain and known to function as a phagocytic receptor. Here, we provide evidence that MEGF10 is involved in the uptake of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ42) in the brain. Overexpression of MEGF10 dramatically increased Aβ42 uptake in Hela cells. Knockdown of endogenous MEGF10 expression significantly decreased Aβ42 uptake in N2A neuroblastoma cells. MEGF10-mediated Aβ uptake is mostly dependent on lipid raft endocytosis pathway. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the conserved cytoplasmic NPxY and YxxØ motifs are crucial for MEGF10-mediated uptake of Aβ42 peptide. Thus, the identification of the MEGF10 as a functional receptor that mediates the uptake of amyloid-β peptide will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of amlyoid-β clearance in Alzheimer's disease."
2767055,Co-operative interactions between NFI and the adenovirus DNA binding protein at the adenovirus origin of replication.,"The DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions proposed for the stability of nucleoprotein complexes at the origin of replication in prokaryotes are also thought to impart regulatory precision in eukaryotic DNA replication. This type of specificity can be observed, for example, during adenovirus DNA replication where efficient initiation requires that nuclear factor I (NFI) binds to the origin of DNA replication. Addition of purified NFI stimulates the initiation of adenovirus DNA replication in vitro in a reaction that is dependent on the concentration of the adenovirus DNA binding protein (DBP). However, the molecular basis for the synergistic action of NFI and DBP during replication is at present unknown. We report here that DBP increases the affinity of NFI for its binding site in the replication origin. DBP did not, however, increase the affinity of another eukaryotic sequence-specific DNA binding protein, EBP1, for its recognition site. Other single-stranded DNA binding proteins could not substitute for DBP in increasing NFI affinity for its binding site. In addition, DBP was found to alter the binding kinetics of NFI, both by increasing the rate of association and decreasing the rate of dissociation of NFI with the DNA template. The co-operativity between NFI and DBP was also demonstrated on another DNA template, a human NFI site (FIB2), suggesting that this interaction is of general occurrence and not restricted to the adenovirus origin of replication."
19073181,Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein modulates template selection by the RNA polymerase in in vitro system.,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A phosphoprotein is a component of virus replicase. Here we demonstrate that in vitro unphosphorylated NS5A protein inhibits HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity in polyA-oligoU system but has little effect on synthesis of viral RNA. The phosphorylated casein kinase (CK) II NS5A protein causes the opposite effect on RdRp in each of these systems. The phosphorylation of NS5A protein with CKII does not affect its affinity to the HCV RdRp and RNA. The NS5A phosphorylation with CKI does not change the RdRp activity. Herein we report evidence that the NS5A prevents template binding to the RdRp.
18616943,Phosphorylation of U24 from Human Herpes Virus type 6 (HHV-6) and its potential role in mimicking myelin basic protein (MBP) in multiple sclerosis.,"Myelin basic protein (MBP) from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients contains lower levels of phosphorylation at Thr97 than normal individuals. The significance of phosphorylation at this site is not fully understood, but it is proposed to play a role in the normal functioning of MBP. Human Herpesvirus Type 6 encodes the protein U24, which has tentatively been implicated in the pathology of MS. U24 shares a 7 amino acid stretch encompassing the Thr97 phosphorylation site of MBP: PRTPPPS. We demonstrate using a combination of mass spectrometry, thin layer chromatography and autoradiography, that U24 can be phosphorylated at the equivalent threonine. Phospho-U24 may confound signalling or other pathways in which phosphorylated MBP may participate, precipitating a pathological process."
22004763,Identification of amino acid residues in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase that are critical for the proteolytic processing of Gag-Pol precursors.,"The efficient processing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag-Pol requires not only protease activity but also specific reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase sequences. However, the critical amino acid residues of the HIV-1 Pol gene involved in protease-mediated Gag-Pol processing have not been precisely defined. Here, we found that the substitution of Thr-128 or Tyr-146 with Ala markedly impaired the proteolytic processing of the MA/CA, p66/p51 and RT/IN sites but did not affect the normal processing of other sites. Moreover, a Thr-128 or Tyr-146 mutation in RT abolished RT dimerization in vitro. These results suggest that Thr-128 and Tyr-146 within the RT region play important roles in protease-mediated Gag-Pol processing."
11509578,mDia-interacting protein acts downstream of Rho-mDia and modifies Src activation and stress fiber formation.,"The formin homology protein mDia is a Rho GTPase effector protein that participates in stress fiber formation, cytokinesis, and transcriptional activation of the serum response factor. Although the function of another effector of Rho, Rho-associated kinase, is well established, relatively little is known about the functional mechanism and the downstream targets of mDia. Our recent report of a Rho-mDia-Src-tyrosine kinase pathway suggested an important role for mDia in cell adhesion turnover. We identified a new mDia-interacting protein which is expressed ubiquitously. The new protein mainly binds to the proline-rich region of mDia through its Src homology 3 domain and also binds to Grb2 through its proline-rich domain. The protein is localized at the cell periphery and membrane ruffles and co-localizes with mDia. Co-expression of vSrc and the mDia-interacting protein induces significant morphological changes at focal contacts and activation of vSrc. Furthermore, we found that the mDia-interacting protein plays an important role in stress fiber formation induced by active mDia1. Our results suggest that this new protein regulates actin polymerization and cell adhesion turnover in the downstream portion of the Rho-mDia pathway by interacting with Grb2 and Src."
22172278,Discovery of a novel enzymatic cleavage site for botulinum neurotoxin F5.,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) cause botulism by cleaving proteins necessary for nerve transmission. There are seven serotypes of BoNT, A-G, characterized by their response to antisera. Many serotypes are further distinguished into differing subtypes based on amino acid sequence, some of which result in functional differences. Our laboratory previously reported that all tested subtypes within each serotype have the same site of enzymatic activity. Recently, three new subtypes of BoNT/F; /F3, /F4, and /F5, were reported. Here, we report that BoNT/F5 cleaves substrate synaptobrevin-2 in a different location than the other BoNT/F subtypes, between (54)L and (55)E. This is the first report of cleavage of synaptobrevin-2 in this location."
21113130,Metalloprotease type III effectors that specifically cleave JNK and NF-κB.,"Two major arms of the inflammatory response are the NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Here, we show that enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) employs the type III secretion system to target these two signalling arms by injecting host cells with two effector proteins, NleC and NleD. We provide evidence that NleC and NleD are Zn-dependent endopeptidases that specifically clip and inactivate RelA (p65) and JNK, respectively, thus blocking NF-κB and AP-1 activation. We show that NleC and NleD co-operate and complement other EPEC effectors in accomplishing maximal inhibition of IL-8 secretion. This is a remarkable example of a pathogen using multiple effectors to manipulate systematically the host inflammatory response signalling network."
12620801,Requirement of E6AP and the features of human papillomavirus E6 necessary to support degradation of p53.,"E6 oncoproteins from human papillomavirus type 16 (16E6) and Bovine Papillomavirus type 1 (BE6) bind to leucine rich peptides (called charged leucine, LXXLL, or signature peptides) found on target cellular proteins. BE6 and 16E6 both bind the product of the UBE3A gene called E6AP on a charged leucine peptide, LQELL. E6AP is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that together with 16E6 interacts with p53 to target p53 degradation. Although both BE6 and 16E6 bind the LQELL peptide of E6AP, only 16E6 acts as an adapter to then bring p53 to E6AP. In order to determine how E6 proteins function as adapters, 16E6, p53, and E6AP were expressed in yeast, and were shown to form a tri-molecular complex. 16E6 mutants were selected that retained interactions with E6AP yet were defective for interaction with p53. Such 16E6 mutations were typically within the amino-terminus of 16E6. Through the use of E6AP null cells, transfected E6AP was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the degradation of p53 in the presence of 16E6. However, the interaction of 16E6 with E6AP was complex. While BE6 interacts only with the LQELL motif of E6AP, an intact LQELL motif is not necessary either for interaction of 16E6 with E6AP or for p53 degradation. In addition, 16E6 mutants that fail to bind the LQELL motif of E6AP can support p53 degradation. These results indicate that 16E6 may have multiple modes of interaction with E6AP and that assembly of p53 containing complexes for targeted degradation by E6AP may occur in more than one way. These results have implications for potential targeting of the interaction of 16E6 and E6AP in the therapy of HPV-induced cancer."
20638388,Interaction of human immunodeficiency virus gp120 with the voltage-gated potassium channel BEC1.,"Retrovirus replication critically depends on a dynamic interplay between retroviral and host proteins. We report on the binding of the surface subunit (glycoprotein 120 (gp120)) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope protein (Env) to the cytoplasmic C-terminus of the voltage-gated potassium channel BEC1 (brain-specific ether-a-go-go-like channel 1), an interaction that can result in the repression of BEC's activity and the inhibition of HIV-1 particle-release. BEC1 protein was found to be expressed in T cells and macrophages, the major target cells of HIV-1. Thus, gp120/BEC1 interaction may be involved in HIV-1 life cycle and/or pathogenesis."
20869963,Interaction of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I Rex protein with Dicer suppresses RNAi silencing.,"Double-stranded RNAs suppress the expression of homologous genes through an evolutionarily conserved process called RNA interference (RNAi) or post-transcriptional gene silencing. A bidentate nuclease called Dicer has been implicated as the protein responsible for the production of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In our experiments, Rex overexpression reduced the efficiency of short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated RNAi. The interaction of Dicer with Rex inhibited the conversion of shRNA to siRNA. These results suggest that the interaction of Dicer with HTLV-I Rex inhibits Dicer activity and thereby reduces the efficiency of the conversion of shRNA to siRNA."
21806988,Phospholipid scramblase 1 mediates hepatitis C virus entry into host cells.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects human hepatocytes through several host factors. However, other prerequisite factors for viral entry remain to be identified. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that human phospholipid scramblase 1 interacts with HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2. These physical interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Knocking down the expression of PLSCR1 inhibited the entry of HCV pseudoparticles. Moreover, PLSCR1 was required for the initial attachment of HCV onto hepatoma cells, where it specifically interacted with entry factor OCLN. We show that PLSCR1 is a novel attachment factor for HCV entry."
17067581,Modulation of HIV-1 Rev protein abundance and activity by polyubiquitination with unconventional Lys-33 branching.,"The HIV-1 Rev protein plays a key role in virus replication by allowing export to the cytoplasm of unspliced or singly-spliced RNAs. In this report, we investigated whether Rev is modified by ubiquitination or sumoylation. Whereas no evidence of sumoylation was obtained, transient expression experiments showed that ubiquitin conjugates to Rev as high molecular weight polyubiquitin chains. Mutation of the three lysine residues of Rev showed that the site of ubiquitin conjugation is Lys-115. Experiments with ubiquitin mutants including a single lysine at every seven possible position indicated that branching of the polyubiquitin chains mainly involves Lys-33. Mutation of Rev Lys-115 to arginine reduces markedly the steady state amount of the protein, but does not impair its ability to export RNA via the Rev response element. These observations support the notion that polyubiquitination of Rev stabilizes the viral protein but hinders its activity."
19327355,Requirement for microtubule integrity in the SOCS1-mediated intracellular dynamics of HIV-1 Gag.,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a recently identified host factor that positively regulates the intracellular trafficking and stability of HIV-1 Gag. We here examine the molecular mechanism by which SOCS1 regulates intercellular Gag trafficking and virus particle production. We find that SOCS1 colocalizes with Gag along the microtubule network and promotes microtubule stability. SOCS1 also increases the amount of Gag associated with microtubules. Both nocodazole treatment and the expression of the microtubule-destabilizing protein, stathmin, inhibit the enhancement of HIV-1 particle production by SOCS1. SOCS1 facilitates Gag ubiquitination and the co-expression of a dominant-negative ubiquitin significantly inhibits the association of Gag with microtubules. We thus propose that the microtubule network plays a role in SOCS1-mediated HIV-1 Gag transport and virus particle formation."
19631645,Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein increases hepatic lipid accumulation via induction of activation and expression of PPARgamma.,"Steatosis is an established risk factor for disease progression in cases of chronic hepatitis C. Recently it was demonstrated that Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core and non-structural (NS) 2 proteins (NS2) induce lipid accumulation in hepatic cells. However, it has yet to be determined whether other HCV proteins are associated with lipid metabolism. The NS5A augmented the transcriptional activity and gene expression of PPARgamma. Furthermore, NS5A increased the ability to recruit the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1s to the PPRE with PPARgamma, as well as the interaction with PPARgamma2 and PGC-1alpha. Our results indicate that NS5A may exploit multiple strategies that enhance PPARgamma-induced lipid accumulation."
21878328,E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah-1 facilitates poly-ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of the hepatitis B viral X protein.,"Hepatitis B viral X protein (HBx) is a multifunctional transactivator and implicated in hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and hepatocarcinogenesis. HBx can be ubiquitinated and degraded through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating HBx ubiquitin-dependent degradation is still unknown. In this study, we identified Siah-1 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for HBx, which interacted with HBx and facilitated HBx poly-ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Co-expression of Siah-1 attenuated the transcriptional transactivation of HBx on glucocorticoid response element (GRE), heat shock response element (HSE) and cAMP response element (CRE) signal pathways. Moreover, Siah-1 participated in p53-mediated HBx degradation. Therefore, Siah-1 may play important roles in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of HBx and may be involved in suppressing the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)."
18985028,Hepatitis C virus infection protein network.,"A proteome-wide mapping of interactions between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human proteins was performed to provide a comprehensive view of the cellular infection. A total of 314 protein-protein interactions between HCV and human proteins was identified by yeast two-hybrid and 170 by literature mining. Integration of this data set into a reconstructed human interactome showed that cellular proteins interacting with HCV are enriched in highly central and interconnected proteins. A global analysis on the basis of functional annotation highlighted the enrichment of cellular pathways targeted by HCV. A network of proteins associated with frequent clinical disorders of chronically infected patients was constructed by connecting the insulin, Jak/STAT and TGFbeta pathways with cellular proteins targeted by HCV. CORE protein appeared as a major perturbator of this network. Focal adhesion was identified as a new function affected by HCV, mainly by NS3 and NS5A proteins."
19745842,Vesicular stomatitis virus inhibits mitotic progression and triggers cell death.,"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infects and kills a wide range of cell types; however, the mechanisms involved in VSV-mediated cell death are not fully understood. Here we show that VSV infection interferes with mitotic progression, resulting in cell death. This effect requires the interaction of VSV matrix (M) protein with the Rae1-Nup98 complex in mitosis, which is associated with a subset of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). VSV displaced Rae1 from spindle poles, caused spindle abnormalities and triggered substantial cell death during metaphase. These effects were attenuated in cells infected with VSV expressing a mutant M protein that does not bind efficiently to the Rae1-Nup98-RNP complex. In cells that progressed to late mitosis, M protein prevented proper nuclear formation and chromatin decondensation. VSV is an oncolytic (anti-tumour) agent as it preferentially replicates and kills tumour cells. As tumour cells have a high mitotic index, VSV-mediated mitotic cell death probably contributes to its oncolytic activity."
21156026,Peptides that bind the HIV-1 integrase and modulate its enzymatic activity--kinetic studies and mode of action.,"Several peptides that specifically bind the HIV-1 integrase (IN) and either inhibit or stimulate its enzymatic activity were developed in our laboratories. Kinetic studies using 3'-end processing and strand-transfer assays were performed to study the mode of action of these peptides. The effects of the various peptides on the interaction between IN and its substrate DNA were also studied by fluorescence anisotropy. On the basis of our results, we divided these IN-interacting peptides into three groups: (a) IN-inhibitory peptides, whose binding to IN decrease its affinity for the substrate DNA - these peptides increased the K(m) of the IN-DNA interaction, and were thus inhibitory; (b) peptides that slightly increased the K(m) of the IN-DNA interaction, but in addition modified the V(max) and K(cat) values of the IN, and thus stimulated or inhibited IN activity, respectively; and (c) peptides that bound IN but had no effect on its enzymatic activity. We elucidated the approximate binding sites of the peptides in the structure of IN, providing structural insights into their mechanism of action. The IN-stimulating peptide bound IN in several specific sites that did not bind any of the inhibitory peptides. This may account for its unique activity."
15205463,Coordinated regulation of replication protein A activities by its subunits p14 and p32.,"The heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA) has multiple essential activities in eukaryotic DNA metabolism and in signaling pathways. Despite extensive analyses, the functions of the smallest RPA subunit p14 are still unknown. To solve this issue we produced and characterized a dimeric RPA complex lacking p14, RPADeltap14, consisting of p70 and p32. RPADeltap14 was able to bind single-stranded DNA, but its binding mode and affinity differed from those of the heterotrimeric complex. Moreover, in the RPADeltap14 complex p32 only minimally recognized the 3'-end of a primer in a primer-template junction. Partial proteolytic digests revealed that p14 and p32 together stabilize the C terminus of p70 against degradation. Although RPADeltap14 efficiently supported bidirectional unwinding of double-stranded DNA and interacted with both the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen and cellular DNA polymerase alpha-primase, it did not support cell-free SV40 DNA replication. This inability manifested itself in a failure to support both the primer synthesis and primer elongation reactions. These data reveal that efficient binding and correct positioning of the RPA complex on single-stranded DNA requires all three subunits to support DNA replication."
12614460,JlpA of Campylobacter jejuni interacts with surface-exposed heat shock protein 90alpha and triggers signalling pathways leading to the activation of NF-kappaB and p38 MAP kinase in epithelial cells.,"Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of acute bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. The mechanism by which C. jejuni interacts with host cells, however, is still poorly understood. Our previous study has shown that the C. jejuni surface lipoprotein JlpA mediates adherence of the bacterium to epithelial cells. In this report, we demonstrated that JlpA interacts with HEp-2 cell surface heat shock protein (Hsp) 90alpha and initiates signalling pathways leading to activation of NF-kappaB and p38 MAP kinase. Gel overlay and GST pull down assays showed that JlpA interacts with Hsp90alpha. Geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of Hsp90, and anti-human Hsp90alpha antibody significantly blocked the interaction between JlpA and Hsp90alpha, suggesting a direct interaction between JlpA and HEp-2 cell surface-exposed Hsp90alpha. The treatment of HEp-2 cells with GST-JlpA initiated two signalling pathways: one leading to the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB; and another one to the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. The activation of NF-kappaB and p38 MAP kinase in HEp-2 cells suggest that JlpA triggers inflammatory/immune responses in host cells following C. jejuni infection."
12379483,"Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein binds TBP and p53, inhibiting their DNA binding and p53 interactions with TBP and ERCC3.","Among the hepatotropic viruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered to be the leading cause of liver disease in humans, affecting approximately 2% of the world population. HCV-encoded nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a 56-58-kDa phosphoprotein, which is produced from the processing of viral polyprotein. The potential mechanism(s) by which NS5A is able to influence key cellular processes are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the functional properties of NS5A. In vivo co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays demonstrated that NS5A forms a heteromeric complex with TATA box binding protein (TBP) and tumor suppressor protein p53. Mutants of TBP and p53 showed reduced binding to NS5A. To determine the functional relevance of these associations, we found that NS5A inhibits the binding of both p53 and TBP to their DNA consensus binding sequences in vitro. NS5A also inhibited the p53-TBP and p53-excision repair cross complementing factor 3 (ERCC3) protein-protein complex formation. Furthermore, NS5A repressed the p53 regulated p21 (WAF1) promoter and a synthetic promoter containing multiple p53 responsive DNA elements binding sites in HCT116 p53(+/+) cell line. p53-mediated transcriptional activation from both promoters was reduced approximately 3-5-fold following expression of NS5A. Taken together, these results suggest that NS5A may exert its influence on key cellular processes by functional associations with p53 and TBP. This could explain one of the possible mechanism(s) by which NS5A is able to exert its effect on cellular gene expression and cell growth regulation."
15215855,A membrane protein required for dislocation of misfolded proteins from the ER.,"After insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), proteins that fail to fold there are destroyed. Through a process termed dislocation such misfolded proteins arrive in the cytosol, where ubiquitination, deglycosylation and finally proteasomal proteolysis dispense with the unwanted polypeptides. The machinery involved in the extraction of misfolded proteins from the ER is poorly defined. The human cytomegalovirus-encoded glycoproteins US2 and US11 catalyse the dislocation of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) products, resulting in their rapid degradation. Here we show that US11 uses its transmembrane domain to recruit class I MHC products to a human homologue of yeast Der1p, a protein essential for the degradation of a subset of misfolded ER proteins. We show that this protein, Derlin-1, is essential for the degradation of class I MHC molecules catalysed by US11, but not by US2. We conclude that Derlin-1 is an important factor for the extraction of certain aberrantly folded proteins from the mammalian ER."
12626518,The yersinia virulence factor YopM forms a novel protein complex with two cellular kinases.,"Pathogenic Yersinia contain a virulence plasmid that encodes genes for intracellular effectors, which neutralize the host immune response. One effector, YopM, is necessary for Yersinia virulence, but its function in host cells is unknown. To identify potential cellular pathways affected by YopM, proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with YopM in mammalian cells were isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. Results demonstrate that two kinases, protein kinase C-like 2 (PRK2) and ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (RSK1), interact directly with YopM. These two kinases associate only when YopM is present, and expression of YopM in cells stimulates the activity of both kinases. RSK1 is activated directly by interaction with YopM, and RSK1 kinase activity is required for YopM-stimulated PRK2 activity. YopM activation of RSK1 occurs independently of the actions of YopJ on the MAPK pathway. YopM is also required for Yersinia-induced changes in RSK1 mobility in infected macrophage cells. These results identify the first intracellular targets of YopM and suggest YopM acts to stimulate the activity of PRK2 and RSK1."
9371602,Direct interaction of hepatitis C virus core protein with the cellular lymphotoxin-beta receptor modulates the signal pathway of the lymphotoxin-beta receptor.,"Previous studies suggest that the core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a pleiotropic function in the replication cycle of the virus. To understand the role of this protein in HCV pathogenesis, we used a yeast two-hybrid protein interaction cloning system to search for cellular proteins physically interacting with the HCV core protein. One such cellular gene was isolated and characterized as the gene encoding the lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LT-betaR). In vitro binding analysis demonstrated that the HCV core protein binds to the C-terminal 98 amino acids within the intracellular domain of the LT-betaR that is involved in signal transduction, although the binding affinity of the full-length HCV core protein was weaker than that of its C-terminally truncated form. Our results also indicated that the N-terminal 40-amino-acid segment of the HCV core protein was sufficient for interaction with LT-betaR and that the core protein could form complexes with the oligomeric form of the intracellular domain of LT-betaR, which is a prerequisite for downstream signaling of this receptor. Similar to other members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, LT-betaR is involved in the cytotoxic effect of the signaling pathway, and thus we have elucidated the biological consequence of interaction between the HCV core protein and LT-betaR. Our results indicated that in the presence of the synergizing agent gamma interferon, the HCV core protein enhances the cytotoxic effects of recombinant forms of LT-betaR ligand in HeLa cells but not in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, this enhancement of the cytolytic activity was cytokine specific, since in the presence of cycloheximide, the expression of the HCV core protein did not elicit an increase in the cytolytic activity of TNF in both HeLa and hepatoma cells. In summary, the HCV core protein can associate with LT-betaR, and this protein-protein interaction has a modulatory effect on the signaling pathway of LT-betaR in certain cell types. Given the known roles of LT-betaR/LT-alpha1,beta2 receptor-ligand interactions in the normal development of peripheral lymphoid organs and in triggering cytolytic activity and NF-kappaB activation in certain cell types, our finding implies that the HCV core protein may aggravate these biological functions of LT-betaR, resulting in pathogenesis in HCV-infected cells."
11000236,Human herpesvirus 8 LANA interacts with proteins of the mSin3 corepressor complex and negatively regulates Epstein-Barr virus gene expression in dually infected PEL cells.,"The human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is expressed in all latently HHV-8 infected cells and in HHV-8-associated tumors, including primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). To better understand the contribution of LANA to tumorigenesis and to the PEL phenotype, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen which identified the corepressor protein SAP30 as a LANA binding protein. SAP30 is a constituent of a large multicomponent complex that brings histone deacetylases to the promoter. Glutathione S-transferase affinity assays confirmed interaction between LANA and SAP30 and also demonstrated interactions between LANA and two other members of the corepressor complex, mSin3A and CIR. The corepressors bound to the amino-terminal 340-amino-acid domain of LANA. In transient expression assays, this same domain of LANA mediated repression when targeted to a 5xGal4tk-CAT reporter as a GAL4-LANA fusion. PEL cells have the unusual feature that they are frequently dually infected with both HHV-8 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We found that EBV EBNA-1 expression is downregulated in PEL cells at both the RNA and protein levels. In transient expression assays, LANA repressed activated expression from the EBV Qp and Cp latency promoters. Reduction of endogenous Qp activity could also be demonstrated in EBV-infected Rael cells transfected with a LANA expression plasmid. In contrast to the effect of LANA on EBV latency promoters, LANA activated expression from its own promoter. The data indicate that LANA can mediate transcriptional repression through recruitment of an mSin3 corepressor complex and further that LANA-mediated repression is likely to contribute to the low level of EBV latency gene expression seen in dually infected PEL cells."
10329544,Hepatitis C virus core protein interacts with a human DEAD box protein DDX3.,"Several studies have implicated hepatitis C virus (HCV) core in influencing the expression of host genes. To identify cellular factors with a possible role in HCV replication and pathogenesis, we looked for cellular proteins that interact with the viral core protein. A human liver cDNA library was screened in a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify cellular proteins that bind to core. Several positive clones were isolated, one of which encoded the C-terminal 253 amino acids of a putative RNA helicase, a DEAD box protein designated DDX3. Bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase-DDX3 fusion protein specifically pulled down in vitro translated and radiolabeled HCV core, confirming a direct interaction. Immunofluorescent staining of HeLa cells with a polyclonal antiserum showed that DDX3 is located predominantly in nuclear speckles and at low levels throughout the cytoplasm. In cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HCV structural proteins (core, E1, and E2), DDX3 and core colocalized in distinct spots in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm. The regions of the proteins involved in binding were found by deletion analysis to be the N-terminal 59 amino acid residues of core and a C-terminal RS-like domain of DDX3. The human DDX3 is a putative RNA helicase and a member of a highly conserved DEAD box subclass that includes murine PL10, Xenopus An3, and yeast Ded1 proteins. Their role in RNA metabolism or gene expression is unknown. The significance of core-helicase interaction in HCV replication and pathogenesis is discussed."
9525578,Modulation of Sp1 phosphorylation by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat.,"We previously reported (K. T. Jeang, R. Chun, N. H. Lin, A. Gatignol, C. G. Glabe, and H. Fan, J. Virol. 67: 6224-6233, 1993) that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat and Sp1 form a protein-protein complex. Here, we have characterized the physical interaction and a functional consequence of Tat-Sp1 contact. Using in vitro protein chromatography, we mapped the region in Tat that contacts Sp1 to amino acids 30 to 55. We found that in cell-free reactions, Tat augmented double-stranded DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)-mediated Sp1 phosphorylation in a contact-dependent manner. Tat mutants that do not bind Sp1 failed to influence phosphorylation of the latter. In complementary experiments, we also found that Tat forms protein-protein contacts with DNA-PK. We confirmed that in HeLa and Jurkat cells, Tat expression indeed increased the intracellular amount of phosphorylated Sp1 in a manner consistent with the results of cell-free assays. Furthermore, using two phosphatase inhibitors and a kinase inhibitor, we demonstrated a modulation of reporter gene expression as a consequence of changes in Sp1 phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings suggest that activity at the HIV-1 promoter is influenced by phosphorylation of Sp1 which is affected by Tat and DNA-PK."
21614000,Role of the ubiquitin-like protein Hub1 in splice-site usage and alternative splicing.,"Alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNAs diversifies gene products in eukaryotes and is guided by factors that enable spliceosomes to recognize particular splice sites. Here we report that alternative splicing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SRC1 pre-mRNA is promoted by the conserved ubiquitin-like protein Hub1. Structural and biochemical data show that Hub1 binds non-covalently to a conserved element termed HIND, which is present in the spliceosomal protein Snu66 in yeast and mammals, and Prp38 in plants. Hub1 binding mildly alters spliceosomal protein interactions and barely affects general splicing in S. cerevisiae. However, spliceosomes that lack Hub1, or are defective in Hub1-HIND interaction, cannot use certain non-canonical 5' splice sites and are defective in alternative SRC1 splicing. Hub1 confers alternative splicing not only when bound to HIND, but also when experimentally fused to Snu66, Prp38, or even the core splicing factor Prp8. Our study indicates a novel mechanism for splice site utilization that is guided by non-covalent modification of the spliceosome by an unconventional ubiquitin-like modifier."
10544138,Activation of p53 tumor suppressor by hepatitis C virus core protein.,"In addition to being a structural protein that packages the viral genomic RNA, hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein possesses regulatory functions. In this report, we demonstrate that the HCV core protein could enhance the gene transactivation activity of the tumor suppressor p53, regardless of whether p53 was derived from an exogenous or an endogenous gene. The activation of p53 by the HCV core protein was supported by the observation that the HCV core protein could enhance the expression of p21(waf1/Cip1), a downstream effector gene of p53, in a p53-dependent manner. Further studies indicated that the HCV core protein could also suppress hepatocellular growth via p53. The HCV core protein and p53 could bind to each other in vitro, which was evidenced by the coimmunoprecipitation, the GST pull-down, and the Far-Western blot assays. The deletion-mapping analysis indicated that the carboxy-terminal sequence of p53 located between amino acids 366 and 380 was required for the core protein binding. These results raised the possibility that the HCV core protein might activate p53 through direct physical interaction. The persistent perturbation of p53 activity by the HCV core protein during chronic infection may have important consequences in HCV pathogenesis."
10708423,Structure and coding content of CST (BART) family RNAs of Epstein-Barr virus.,"CST (BART BARF0) family viral RNAs are expressed in several types of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, including EBV-associated cancers. Many different spliced forms of these RNAs have been described; here we have clarified the structures of some of the more abundant splicing patterns. We report the first cDNAs representing a full-length CST mRNA from a clone library and further characterize the transcription start. The relative abundance of splicing patterns and genomic analysis of the open reading frames (ORFs) suggest that, in addition to the much studied BARF0 ORF, there may be important products made from some of the upstream ORFs in the CST RNAs. Potential biological functions are identified for two of these. The product of the RPMS1 ORF is shown to be a nuclear protein that can bind to the CBF1 component of Notch signal transduction. RPMS1 can inhibit the transcription activation induced through CBF1 by NotchIC or EBNA-2. The protein product of another CST ORF, A73, is shown to be a cytoplasmic protein which can interact with the cell RACK1 protein. Since RACK1 modulates signaling from protein kinase C and Src tyrosine kinases, the results suggest a possible role for CST products in growth control, perhaps consistent with the abundant transcription of CST RNAs in cancers such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma."
15350211,Coactivators p300 and PCAF physically and functionally interact with the foamy viral trans-activator.,Foamy virus Bel1/Tas trans-activators act as key regulators of gene expression and directly bind to Bel1 response elements (BRE) in both the internal and the 5'LTR promoters leading to strong transcriptional trans-activation. Cellular coactivators interacting with Bel1/Tas are unknown to date.
8995654,Hepatitis C virus core protein interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of lymphotoxin-beta receptor.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is a multifunctional protein. We examined whether it can interact with cellular proteins, thus contributing to viral pathogenesis. Using the HCV core protein as a bait to screen a human liver cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid screening system, we have isolated several positive clones encoding cellular proteins that interact with the HCV core protein. Interestingly, more than half of these clones encode the cytoplasmic domain of lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LT betaR), which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. Their binding was confirmed by in vitro glutathione S-transferase fusion protein binding assay and protein-protein blotting assay to be direct and specific. The binding sites were mapped within a 58-amino-acid region of the cytoplasmic tail of LT betaR. The binding site in the HCV core protein was localized within amino acid residues 36 to 91 from the N terminus, corresponding to the hydrophilic region of the protein. In mammalian cells, the core protein was found to be associated with the membrane-bound LT betaR. Since the LT betaR is involved in germinal center formation and developmental regulation of peripheral lymphoid organs, lymph node development, and apoptotic signaling, the binding of HCV core protein to LT betaR suggests the possibility that this viral protein has an immunomodulating function and may explain the mechanism of viral persistence and pathogenesis of HCV."
15664159,The KSHV immediate-early transcription factor RTA encodes ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that targets IRF7 for proteosome-mediated degradation.,"Many viruses encode proteins that counteract the development of the interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral state. Here, we report that interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), a key mediator of type I IFN induction, is targeted for degradation by binding to the RTA immediate-early nuclear transcription factor encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8). Cotransfection with RTA blocked IRF7-mediated IFNalpha and IFNbeta mRNA production and promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of IRF7 protein in a proteasome-dependent fashion. Addition of RTA also promoted polyubiquitination of IRF7 in an in vitro cell free assay, demonstrating that RTA itself acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. RTA also autoregulated its own polyubiquitination and stability, and both activities were abolished by point mutations in a Cys plus His-rich N-terminal domain. Therefore, manipulation of the stability and function of IRF7 by the KSHV RTA transcription factor provides an unexpected regulatory strategy for circumventing the innate immune defence system."
12883554,A non-proteolytic role for ubiquitin in Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a potent transactivator, Tat, which functions through binding to a short leader RNA, called transactivation responsive element (TAR). Recent studies suggest that Tat activates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), mainly by adapting co-activator complexes, such as p300, PCAF and the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, to the promoter. Here, we show that the proto-oncoprotein Hdm2 interacts with Tat and mediates its ubiquitination in vitro and in vivo. In addition, Hdm2 is a positive regulator of Tat-mediated transactivation, indicating that the transcriptional properties of Tat are stimulated by ubiquitination. Fusion of ubiquitin to Tat bypasses the requirement of Hdm2 for efficient transactivation, supporting the notion that ubiquitin has a non-proteolytic function in Tat-mediated transactivation."
11333915,"Hepatitis B virus large envelope protein interacts with gamma2-adaptin, a clathrin adaptor-related protein.","For the outcome of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the viral L envelope protein with its pre-S domain performs pivotal functions by mediating attachment of HBV to liver cells, envelopment of viral capsids, release of (sub)viral particles, regulation of supercoiled DNA amplification, and transcriptional transactivation. To assess its multiple functions and host-protein assistance involved, we initiated a two-hybrid screen using the L-specific pre-S1 domain as bait. With this approach, we have identified gamma2-adaptin, a putative member of the clathrin adaptor proteins responsible for protein sorting and trafficking, as a specific binding partner of L protein. Evidence for a physical interaction between L protein and gamma2-adaptin was also demonstrated by affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation, and the binding sites were mapped to the L-specific pre-S1 domain and the gamma2-adaptin-specific ear domain. The specificity of the interaction was further sustained by the failure of gamma1-adaptin, a closely related gamma2-adaptin homologue, to associate with L protein. Analysis of an L mutant protein indicates that the L-gamma2-adaptin interaction strictly depends on the pre-S1 domain of transmembrane L protein oriented to the cytosol and thus appears to occur in the cytosolic environment. Interestingly, coexpression of the two interacting partners in transfected cells resulted in recruitment of gamma2-adaptin by L protein onto cis-Golgi-like structures, strongly indicating that the association is physiologically relevant. Together, the results suggest a role for gamma2-adaptin in L-mediated processes of viral biogenesis and/or pathogenesis, such as facilitating and guiding HBV assembly."
9733834,E1B 55-kilodalton-associated protein: a cellular protein with RNA-binding activity implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport of adenovirus and cellular mRNAs.,"The adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) early 1B 55-kDa protein (E1B-55kDa) is a multifunctional phosphoprotein that regulates viral DNA replication and nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport in lytically infected cells. In addition, E1B-55kDa provides functions required for complete oncogenic transformation of rodent cells in cooperation with the E1A proteins. Using the far-Western technique, we have isolated human genes encoding E1B-55kDa-associated proteins (E1B-APs). The E1B-AP5 gene encodes a novel nuclear RNA-binding protein of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family that is highly related to hnRNP-U/SAF-A. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that two distinct segments in the 55-kDa polypeptide which partly overlap regions responsible for p53 binding are required for complex formation with E1B-AP5 in Ad-infected cells and that this protein interaction is modulated by the adenovirus E4orf6 protein. Expression of E1B-AP5 efficiently interferes with Ad5 E1A/E1B-mediated transformation of primary rat cells. Furthermore, stable expression of E1B-AP5 in Ad-infected cells overcomes the E1B-dependent inhibition of cytoplasmic host mRNA accumulation. These data suggest that E1B-AP5 might play a role in RNA transport and that this function is modulated by E1B-55kDa in Ad-infected cells."
15998638,Vaccinia virus protein A52R activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and potentiates lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-10.,"Vaccinia virus (VV) has many mechanisms to suppress and modulate the host immune response. The VV protein A52R was previously shown to act as an intracellular inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) signaling by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that A52R interacted with both tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (IRAK2). The effect of A52R on signals other than NFkappaB was not determined. Here, we show that A52R does not inhibit TLR-induced p38 or c-Jun amino N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen activating protein (MAP) kinase activation. Rather, A52R could drive activation of these kinases. Two lines of evidence suggested that the A52R/TRAF6 interaction was critical for these effects. First, A52R-induced p38 MAP kinase activation was inhibited by overexpression of the TRAF domain of TRAF6, which sequestered A52R and inhibited its interaction with endogenous TRAF6. Second, a truncated version of A52R, which interacted with IRAK2 and not TRAF6, was unable to activate p38. Because interleukin 10 (IL-10) production is strongly p38-dependent, we examined the effect of A52R on IL-10 gene induction. A52R was found to be capable of inducing the IL-10 promoter through a TRAF6-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, A52R enhanced lipopolysaccharide/TLR4-induced IL-10 production, while inhibiting the TLR-induced NFkappaB-dependent genes IL-8 and RANTES. These results show that although A52R inhibits NFkappaB activation by multiple TLRs it can simultaneously activate MAP kinases. A52R-mediated enhancement of TLR-induced IL-10 may be important to virulence, given the role of IL-10 in immunoregulation."
20007272,Z proteins of New World arenaviruses bind RIG-I and interfere with type I interferon induction.,"The retinoic acid-inducible gene I product (RIG-I) is a cellular sensor of RNA virus infection that regulates the cellular beta interferon (IFN-beta) response. The nucleoproteins (NP) of arenaviruses are reported to antagonize the IFN response by inhibiting interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Here, we demonstrate that the Z proteins of four New World (NW) arenaviruses, Guanarito virus (GTOV), Junin virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MAVC), and Sabia virus (SABV), bind to RIG-I, resulting in downregulation of the IFN-beta response. We show that expression of the four NW arenavirus Z proteins inhibits IFN-beta mRNA induction in A549 cells in response to RNA bearing 5' phosphates (5'pppRNA). NW arenavirus Z proteins interact with RIG-I in coimmunoprecipitation studies and colocalize with RIG-I. Furthermore, expression of Z proteins interferes with the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS. Z expression also impedes the nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) and IRF-3 activation. Our results indicate that NW arenavirus Z proteins, but not Z protein of the Old World (OW) arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or Lassa virus, bind to RIG-I and inhibit downstream activation of the RIG-I signaling pathway, preventing the transcriptional induction of IFN-beta."
20639899,SUMO modification of E1B-55K oncoprotein regulates isoform-specific binding to the tumour suppressor protein PML.,"The E1B-55K product from human adenovirus is a substrate of the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-conjugation system. SUMOylation of E1B-55K is required to transform primary mammalian cells in cooperation with adenovirus E1A and to repress p53 tumour suppressor functions. The biochemical consequences of SUMO1 conjugation of 55K have so far remained elusive. Here, we report that E1B-55K physically interacts with different isoforms of the tumour suppressor protein promyelocytic leukaemia (PML). We show that E1B-55K binds to PML isoforms IV and V in a SUMO1-dependent and -independent manner. Interaction with PML-IV promotes the localization of 55K to PML-containing subnuclear structures (PML-NBs). In virus-infected cells, this process is negatively regulated by other viral proteins, indicating that binding to PML is controlled through reversible SUMOylation in a timely coordinated manner. These results together with earlier work are consistent with the idea that SUMOylation regulates targeting of E1B-55K to PML-NBs, known to control transcriptional regulation, tumour suppression, DNA repair and apoptosis. Furthermore, they suggest that SUMO1-dependent modulation of p53-dependent growth suppression through E1B-55K PML-IV interaction has a key role in adenovirus-mediated cell transformation."
12606074,"Non-covalent interaction between nucleocapsid protein of Tula hantavirus and small ubiquitin-related modifier-1, SUMO-1.","To find cellular binding counterparts for the nucleocapsid protein (N) of Tula hantavirus (TULV), two cDNA libraries were screened using yeast two-hybrid systems based on LexA and Gal4 transcription factors. Five cDNA clones encoding SUMO-1 (Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier, also known as sentrin) were selected in the LexA system. Confocal microscopy revealed that, in infected cells, TULV N protein and SUMO-1 colocalize at the perinuclear area providing further evidence for interaction between the two proteins. Neither endogenous nor transiently expressed SUMO-1 was found to be covalently linked to the N protein. Additional evidence that the interaction is non-covalent was obtained in immunoprecipitation experiments: N protein-specific antibodies precipitated SUMO-1 from TULV-infected Vero E6 cell lysate. By using a pepscan assay, two basic amino acid stretches in the N-terminal part of SUMO-1 were shown to be involved in the interaction."
15949438,Binding of pRB to the PHD protein RBP2 promotes cellular differentiation.,"pRB can enforce a G1 block by repressing E2F-responsive promoters. It also coactivates certain non-E2F transcription factors and promotes differentiation. Some pRB variants activate transcription and promote differentiation despite impaired E2F binding and transcriptional repression capabilities. We identified RBP2 in a screen for proteins that bind to such pRB variants. RBP2 resembles other chromatin-associated transcriptional regulators and RBP2 binding tracked with pRB's ability to activate transcription and promote differentiation. RBP2 and pRB colocalize and pRB/RBP2 complexes were detected in chromatin isolated from differentiating cells. RBP2 siRNA phenocopied restoration of pRB function in coactivation and differentiation assays, suggesting that pRB prevents RBP2 from repressing genes required for differentiation. In addition, two bromodomain-containing proteins were identified as RBP2 targets that are transcriptionally activated by pRB in an RBP2-dependent manner. Our results suggest that promotion of differentiation by pRB involves neutralization of free RBP2 and transcriptional activation of RBP2 targets linked to euchromatin maintenance."
14679154,Interaction of retroviral Tax oncoproteins with tristetraprolin and regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression.,"The Tax oncoproteins are transcriptional regulators of viral expression involved in pathogenesis induced by complex leukemogenic retroviruses (or delta-retroviruses, i.e., primate T-cell leukemia viruses and bovine leukemia virus). To better understand the molecular pathways leading to cell transformation, we aimed to identify cellular proteins interacting with Tax."
14609633,Association of the nucleocapsid protein of the Seoul and Hantaan hantaviruses with small ubiquitin-like modifier-1-related molecules.,"We performed yeast two-hybrid screening of a human kidney cell cDNA library to study the biological role of the hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (NP). We found that Seoul virus (SEOV) and Hantaan virus (HTNV) NPs were associated with small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1-interacting proteins PIAS1, PIASxbeta, HIPK2, CHD3, and TTRAP, which interacted with the SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme (Ubc-9) and SUMO-1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Interactions between the HIPK2, CHD3, and TTRAP proteins and SEOV NP were also shown in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. However, there was no interaction between PIAS proteins and NP, which was probably due to the inhibitory effect of PIAS on transcription in the mammalian two-hybrid assay. Nevertheless, a co-expression experiment suggested the existence of a PIAS-NP interaction in the cytoplasm. The region spanning amino acids 100-125 of SEOV NP, which represents a critical region for NP-NP polymerization, was found to be responsible for the interaction with SUMO-1-related molecules in both the yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays. These results add to the information on interactions of hantavirus NP and host cellular proteins."
11983079,Network of protein-protein interactions among iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins in Escherichia coli.,"The assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters is mediated by complex machinery which, in Escherichia coli, is encoded by the iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx-ORF3 gene cluster. Here, we demonstrate the network of protein-protein interactions among the components involved in the machinery. We have constructed (His)(6)-tagged versions of the components and identified their interacting partners that were co-purified from E. coli extracts with a Ni-affinity column. Direct associations of the defined pair of proteins were further examined in yeast cells using the two-hybrid system. In accord with the previous in vitro binding and kinetic experiments, interactions were observed for the combinations of IscS and IscU, IscU and HscB, IscU and HscA, and HscB and HscA. In addition, we have identified previously unreported interactions between IscS and Fdx, IscS and ORF3, IscA and HscA, and HscA and Fdx. We also found, by site-directed mutational analysis combined with the two-hybrid system, that two cysteine residues in IscU are essential for binding with HscB but not with IscS. Despite the complex network of interactions in various combinations of components, heteromultimeric complexes were not observed in our experiments except for the putative oligomeric form of IscU-IscS-ORF3. Thus, the sequential association and dissociation among the IscS, IscU, IscA, HscB, HscA, Fdx, and ORF3 proteins may be a critical process in the assembly of Fe-S clusters."
11129635,The vaccinia virus E3L protein interacts with SUMO-1 and ribosomal protein L23a in a yeast two hybrid assay.,"We report the results of a two-hybrid study which identified clones from a HeLa cDNA library that interact with the vaccinia virus protein E3L. These clones encode the nuclear protein SUMO-1 (also known as PIC-1, sentrin or GMP-1); the cytoplasmic ribosomal protein L23a; and a small peptide sequence of unknown significance."
12588988,The growth factor granulin interacts with cyclin T1 and modulates P-TEFb-dependent transcription.,"Cyclin T1, together with the kinase CDK9, is a component of the transcription elongation factor P-TEFb which binds the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transactivator Tat. P-TEFb facilitates transcription by phosphorylating the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. Cyclin T1 is an exceptionally large cyclin and is therefore a candidate for interactions with regulatory proteins. We identified granulin as a cyclin T1-interacting protein that represses expression from the HIV-1 promoter in transfected cells. The granulins, mitogenic growth factors containing repeats of a cysteine-rich motif, were reported previously to interact with Tat. We show that granulin formed stable complexes in vivo and in vitro with cyclin T1 and Tat. Granulin bound to the histidine-rich domain of cyclin T1, which was recently found to bind to the CTD, but not to cyclin T2. Binding of granulin to P-TEFb inhibited the phosphorylation of a CTD peptide. Granulin expression inhibited Tat transactivation, and tethering experiments showed that this effect was due, at least in part, to a direct action on cyclin T1 in the absence of Tat. In addition, granulin was a substrate for CDK9 but not for the other transcription-related kinases CDK7 and CDK8. Thus, granulin is a cellular protein that interacts with cyclin T1 to inhibit transcription."
15647482,"L1-mediated branching is regulated by two ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-binding sites, the RSLE region and a novel juxtamembrane ERM-binding region.","We investigated how the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 mediates neurite outgrowth through L1-L1 homophilic interactions. Wild-type L1 and L1 with mutations in the cytoplasmic domain (CD) were introduced into L1 knock-out neurons, and transfected neurons were grown on an L1 substrate. Neurite length and branching were compared between wild-type L1 and L1CD mutations. Surprisingly, the L1CD is not required for L1-mediated neurite outgrowth but plays a critical role in neurite branching, through both the juxtamembrane region and the RSLE region. We demonstrate that both regions serve as ezrin-moesin-radixin-binding sites. A truncation mutant that deletes 110 of 114 amino acids of the L1CD still supports neurite outgrowth on an L1 substrate, suggesting that a coreceptor binds to L1 in cis and mediates neurite outgrowth and that L1-ankyrin interactions are not essential for neurite initiation or outgrowth. These data are consistent with a model in which L1 can influence L1-mediated neurite outgrowth and branching through both the L1CD and a coreceptor."
14618084,Latency-associated nuclear antigen of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus interacts with human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen induced by interferon alpha.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)/human herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8) is tightly linked to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and some cases of multicentric Castleman's disease. Latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is one of a limited number of KSHV genes consistently expressed in these diseases as well as in KSHV-infected cell lines derived from PEL, and has been shown to play crucial role in persistence of KSHV genomes in the infected cells. In this study, we explored the cellular factors that interact with LANA using yeast two-hybrid screening, and isolated a part of gene encoding human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA). MNDA is a hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear proteins with a HIN-200 family member with conserved 200-amino acid repeats. Immunoprecipitation assay revealed that LANA interacted with MNDA in a mammalian embryonic kidney cell line. MNDA transcript was undetectable in three PEL cell lines by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, but it was induced by interferon alpha (IFNalpha). Moreover, LANA and MNDA were co-localized in the nuclei of MNDA-expressing PEL cells. Our results suggest that LANA interacts with MNDA in KSHV-infected cells exposed to IFNalpha. Such interaction may modulate IFN-mediated host defense activities."
11765911,The measles virus (MV) glycoproteins interact with cellular chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum and MV infection upregulates chaperone expression.,"The present study examines the coprecipitation of measles virus (MV) glycoproteins with host cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone proteins. Both the haemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) glycoproteins interacted with calnexin and GRP78, whereas interaction with calreticulin was only demonstrated for the H glycoprotein. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine reduced and delayed the association of F proteins with calnexin. We have previously shown that alpha-glucosidase activity is important for the functionality and antigenicity of the MV F glycoprotein and for release of MV particles from infected cells. Thus, interaction with calnexin appears vital for processing of nascent MV F protein into its functional conformation. In contrast to many other viral glycoproteins, a substantial proportion of the pulsed MV glycoproteins remained associated with ER chaperones for more than 2(1/2) h. Thus, the slow and incomplete migration of MV glycoproteins to the cell surface may result from their retention by ER chaperones, probably due to malfolding. MV infection upregulated the cellular expression of calreticulin and GRP78 and also increased their presence at the cell surface. The chaperone proteins are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, and their induction by MV may play a role for the pathogenesis of measles and its sequelae."
12552023,Molecular chaperone GRP78/BiP interacts with the large surface protein of hepatitis B virus in vitro and in vivo.,"The proper folding and assembly of viral envelope proteins are mediated by host chaperones. In this study, we demonstrated that an endoplasmic reticulum luminal chaperone GRP78/BiP bound specifically to the pre-S1 domain of the L protein in vitro and in vivo where complete viral particles were secreted, suggesting that GRP78/BiP plays an essential role in the proper folding of the L protein and/or assembly of viral envelope proteins."
9223490,Hepatitis C virus envelope proteins bind lactoferrin.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has two envelope proteins, E1 and E2, which form a heterooligomer. During dissection of interacting regions of HCV E1 and E2, we found the presence of an interfering compound or compounds in skim milk. Here we report that human as well as bovine lactoferrin, a multifunctional immunomodulator, binds two HCV envelope proteins. As determined by far-Western blotting, the bacterially expressed E1 and E2 could bind lactoferrin in human milk directly separated or immunopurified and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The bindings of lactoferrin and HCV envelope proteins in vitro were confirmed by another method, the pull-down assay, with immunoprecipitated lactoferrin-bound protein A resin. By the same assay, mammal-expressed recombinant E1 and E2 were also demonstrated to bind human lactoferrin efficiently in vitro. Direct interaction between E2 and lactoferrin was proved in vivo, since anti-human lactoferrin antibody efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with secreted and intracellular forms of the E2 protein, but not glutathione S-transferase (GST), from lysates of HepG2 cells transiently cotransfected with the expression plasmids of human lactoferrin and gE2t-GST (the N-terminal two-thirds of E2 fused to GST) or GST. The N-terminal loop of lactoferrin, the region important for the antibacterial activity, has only a little role in the binding ability to HCV E2 but affected the secretion or stability of lactoferrin. Taken together, these results indicate the specific interaction between lactoferrin and HCV envelope proteins in vivo and in vitro."
8623534,p53 inhibits JC virus DNA replication in vivo and interacts with JC virus large T-antigen.,"The onset of DNA replication is an important step within the life cycle of the human neurotropic polyomavirus JC. In this report, evidence that both the human and the murine tumor suppressor protein p53 strongly inhibit JCV DNA replication in vivo is presented. This inhibition is dose-dependent and not a secondary effect of a decreased expression of JCV large T-antigen in response to p53. Using deletion mutants of murine p53 and tumor-derived point mutations of human p53, the basis of the suppression of JCV DNA replication by p53 was dissected. Deletion of either the amino- or the carboxy-terminal domain of murine p53 did not interfere with the repression of JCV DNA replication. However, deletion of the highly conserved central region of p53 abolished the inhibitory effect on replication. The tumor-derived human mutant p53(His273) inhibited JCV DNA replication significantly, whereas another tumorigenic mutant, p53(His175), had no inhibitory effect Concomitantly, a direct protein-protein interaction between p53 and JCV large T-antigen was lost in mutants which did not affect JCV DNA replication. These results strongly suggest that p53 inhibits JCV DNA replication by interacting with JCV large T-antigen."
16015374,"Gp96 is a receptor for a novel Listeria monocytogenes virulence factor, Vip, a surface protein.","By comparative genomics, we have identified a gene of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes that encodes an LPXTG surface protein absent from nonpathogenic Listeria species. This gene, vip, is positively regulated by PrfA, the transcriptional activator of the major Listeria virulence factors. Vip is anchored to the Listeria cell wall by sortase A and is required for entry into some mammalian cells. Using a ligand overlay approach, we identified a cellular receptor for Vip, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperone Gp96 recently shown to interact with TLRs. The Vip-Gp96 interaction is critical for bacterial entry into some cells. Comparative infection studies using oral and intravenous inoculation of nontransgenic and transgenic mice expressing human E-cadherin demonstrated a role for Vip in Listeria virulence, not only at the intestine level but also in late stages of the infectious process. Vip thus appears as a new virulence factor exploiting Gp96 as a receptor for cell invasion and/or signalling events that may interfere with the host immune response in the course of the infection."
1512257,Activated Src tyrosine kinase phosphorylates Tyr-457 of bovine GTPase-activating protein (GAP) in vitro and the corresponding residue of rat GAP in vivo.,"GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is a key regulator of the cellular Ras protein, which is implicated in oncogenic signal transduction pathways downstream of the viral Src (v-Src) kinase. Previous studies demonstrated that v-Src induces tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP, suggesting that GAP may provide a biochemical link between v-Src and Ras signaling pathways. To determine the precise residues in GAP phosphorylated by Src kinases, we used a baculovirus/insect cell expression system for investigating in vitro phosphorylation of GAP. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis revealed that v-Src and normal cellular Src (c-Src) phosphorylate tyrosine residues in bovine GAP at one major site and one minor site in vitro. Significantly, the major site of GAP phosphorylation in vitro is also the major site of in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP in rat fibroblasts transformed by v-Src. Analyses of GAP deletion mutants and TrpE-GAP fusion proteins established that Tyr-457 of bovine GAP (and the corresponding residue of rat and human GAP) is the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that the v-Src kinase induces phosphorylation of the same tyrosine residue of GAP in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that GAP is a direct substrate of activated Src kinases in vivo. Because epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylates the equivalent tyrosine residue in human GAP (Tyr-460), these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that specific phosphorylation of GAP at this site may have a physiologically important role in regulating mitogenic Ras signaling pathways."
15741165,p400 is required for E1A to promote apoptosis.,"The adenovirus E1A oncoprotein promotes proliferation and transformation by binding cellular proteins, including members of the retinoblastoma protein family, the p300/CREB-binding protein transcriptional coactivators, and the p400-TRRAP chromatin-remodeling complex. E1A also promotes apoptosis, in part, by engaging the ARF-p53 tumor suppressor pathway. We show that E1A induces ARF and p53 and promotes apoptosis in normal fibroblasts by physically associating with the retinoblastoma protein and a p400-TRRAP complex and that its interaction with p300 is largely dispensable for these effects. We further show that E1A increases p400 expression and, conversely, that suppression of p400 using stable RNA interference reduces the levels of ARF, p53, and apoptosis in E1A-expressing cells. Therefore, whereas E1A inactivates the retinoblastoma protein, it requires p400 to efficiently promote cell death. These results identify p400 as a regulator of the ARF-p53 pathway and a component of the cellular machinery that couples proliferation to cell death."
15592428,Multiple activities contribute to Pc2 E3 function.,"Pc2 is a polycomb protein, which has SUMO E3 activity for the corepressors CtBP and CtBP2. Here we demonstrate that, in vivo, Pc2 adapter function contributes to enhancement of CtBP sumoylation. Mutation of the CtBP binding site on Pc2 abolishes E3 activity toward CtBP. However, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of Pc2 that recruits both Ubc9 and CtBP lacks E3 activity. We identify a second domain, which, when coexpressed with the carboxyl-terminal adapter region, restores E3 function. In vitro, this domain has E3 activity in isolation, suggesting that it is a functional domain, and that adapter function is required to selectively corecruit E2 and substrate in vivo. These results demonstrate the presence of two domains in Pc2 that contribute to full in vivo E3 activity, and suggest that SUMO E3s are more than simple platforms to which E2 and substrate bind."
16007075,"EphrinB2 is the entry receptor for Nipah virus, an emergent deadly paramyxovirus.","Nipah virus (NiV) is an emergent paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in up to 70 percent of infected patients, and there is evidence of human-to-human transmission. Endothelial syncytia, comprised of multinucleated giant-endothelial cells, are frequently found in NiV infections, and are mediated by the fusion (F) and attachment (G) envelope glycoproteins. Identification of the receptor for this virus will shed light on the pathobiology of NiV infection, and spur the rational development of effective therapeutics. Here we report that ephrinB2, the membrane-bound ligand for the EphB class of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), specifically binds to the attachment (G) glycoprotein of NiV. Soluble Fc-fusion proteins of ephrinB2, but not ephrinB1, effectively block NiV fusion and entry into permissive cell types. Moreover, transfection of ephrinB2 into non-permissive cells renders them permissive for NiV fusion and entry. EphrinB2 is expressed on endothelial cells and neurons, which is consistent with the known cellular tropism for NiV. Significantly, we find that NiV-envelope-mediated infection of microvascular endothelial cells and primary cortical rat neurons is inhibited by soluble ephrinB2, but not by the related ephrinB1 protein. Cumulatively, our data show that ephrinB2 is a functional receptor for NiV."
19651602,Potent neutralization of anthrax edema toxin by a humanized monoclonal antibody that competes with calmodulin for edema factor binding.,"This study describes the isolation and characterization of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against anthrax edema factor, EF13D. EF13D neutralized edema toxin (ET)-mediated cyclic AMP (cAMP) responses in cells and protected mice from both ET-induced footpad edema and systemic ET-mediated lethality. The antibody epitope was mapped to domain IV of EF. The mAb was able to compete with calmodulin (CaM) for EF binding and displaced CaM from EF-CaM complexes. EF-mAb binding affinity (0.05-0.12 nM) was 50- to 130-fold higher than that reported for EF-CaM. This anti-EF neutralizing mAb could potentially be used alone or with an anti-PA mAb in the emergency prophylaxis and treatment of anthrax infection."
15791211,Interaction of HSP90 to N-WASP leads to activation and protection from proteasome-dependent degradation.,"Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through activation of the Arp2/3 complex. Here, we show that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) regulates N-WASP-induced actin polymerization in cooperation with phosphorylation of N-WASP. HSP90 binds directly to N-WASP, but binding alone does not affect the rate of N-WASP/Arp2/3 complex-induced in vitro actin polymerization. An Src family tyrosine kinase, v-Src, phosphorylates and activates N-WASP. HSP90 increases the phosphorylation of N-WASP by v-Src, leading to enhanced N-WASP-dependent actin polymerization. In addition, HSP90 protects phosphorylated and activated N-WASP from proteasome-dependent degradation, resulting in amplification of N-WASP-dependent actin polymerization. Association between HSP90 and N-WASP is increased in proportion to activation of N-WASP by phosphorylation. HSP90 is colocalized and associated with active N-WASP at podosomes in 3Y1/v-Src cells and at growing neurites in PC12 cells, whose actin structures are clearly inhibited by blocking the binding of HSP90 to N-WASP. These findings suggest that HSP90 induces efficient activation of N-WASP downstream of phosphorylation signal by Src family kinases and is critical for N-WASP-dependent podosome formation and neurite extension."
17715295,Thermodynamically reengineering the listerial invasion complex InlA/E-cadherin.,"Biological processes essentially all depend on the specific recognition between macromolecules and their interaction partners. Although many such interactions have been characterized both structurally and biophysically, the thermodynamic effects of small atomic changes remain poorly understood. Based on the crystal structure of the bacterial invasion protein internalin (InlA) of Listeria monocytogenes in complex with its human receptor E-cadherin (hEC1), we analyzed the interface to identify single amino acid substitutions in InlA that would potentially improve the overall quality of interaction and hence increase the weak binding affinity of the complex. Dissociation constants of InlA-variant/hEC1 complexes, as well as enthalpy and entropy of binding, were quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry. All single substitutions indeed significantly increase binding affinity. Structural changes were verified crystallographically at < or =2.0-A resolution, allowing thermodynamic characteristics of single substitutions to be rationalized structurally and providing unique insights into atomic contributions to binding enthalpy and entropy. Structural and thermodynamic data of all combinations of individual substitutions result in a thermodynamic network, allowing the source of cooperativity between distant recognition sites to be identified. One such pair of single substitutions improves affinity 5,000-fold. We thus demonstrate that rational reengineering of protein complexes is possible by making use of physically distant hot spots of recognition."
20802522,A functional SUMO-interacting motif in the transactivation domain of c-Myb regulates its myeloid transforming ability.,"c-Myb is an essential hematopoietic transcription factor that controls proliferation and differentiation of progenitors during blood cell development. Whereas sumoylation of the C-terminal regulatory domain (CRD) is known to have a major impact on the activity of c-Myb, no role for noncovalent binding of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to c-Myb has been described. Based on the consensus SUMO-interacting motif (SIM), we identified and examined putative SIMs in human c-Myb. Interaction and reporter assays showed that the SIM in the in the transactivation domain of c-Myb (V(267)NIV) is functional. This motif is necessary for c-Myb to be able to interact noncovalently with SUMO, preferentially SUMO2/3. Destroying the SUMO-binding properties by mutation resulted in a large increase in the transactivation potential of c-Myb. Mutational analysis and overexpression of conjugation-defective SUMO argued against intramolecular repression caused by sumoylated CRD and in favor of SUMO-dependent repression in trans. Using both a myeloid cell line-based assay and a primary hematopoietic cell assay, we addressed the transforming abilities of SUMO binding and conjugation mutants. Interestingly, only loss of SUMO binding, and not SUMO conjugation, enhanced the myeloid transformational potential of c-Myb. c-Myb with the SIM mutated conferred a higher proliferative ability than the wild-type and caused an effective differentiation block. This establishes SUMO binding as a mechanism involved in modulating the transactivation activity of c-Myb, and responsible for keeping the transforming potential of the oncoprotein in check."
15894273,Complexity and complementarity of outer membrane protein A recognition by cellular and humoral innate immunity receptors.,"Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) is a conserved major component of the outer membrane of Enterobacteriaceae. Here, we report that OmpA from Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpOmpA) activates macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in a TLR2-dependent way. However, TLR2 does not account for binding of KpOmpA to innate immune cells. KpOmpA binds the scavenger receptors (SRs) LOX-1 and SREC-I, but not other members of the same family. LOX-1 colocalizes and cooperates with TLR2 in triggering cellular responses. The TLR2-activated functional program includes production of the long pentraxin PTX3, a soluble pattern recognition receptor involved in resistance against diverse pathogens. PTX3, in turn, binds KpOmpA but does not affect recognition of this microbial moiety by cellular receptors. KpOmpA-elicited in vivo inflammation is abrogated in TLR2(-/-) mice and significantly reduced in PTX3(-/-) mice. Thus, SR-mediated KpOmpA recognition and TLR2-dependent cellular activation set in motion a nonredundant PTX3-mediated humoral amplification loop of innate immunity."
15327779,"An atomic resolution model for assembly, architecture, and function of the Dr adhesins.","Pathogenic bacteria possess adhesion protein complexes that play essential roles in targeting host cells and in propagating infection. Although each family of adhesion proteins is generally associated with a specific human disease, the Dr family from Escherichia coli is a notable exception, as its members are associated with both diarrheal and urinary tract infections. These proteins are reported to form both fimbrial and afimbrial structures at the bacterial cell surface and target a common host cell receptor, the decay-accelerating factor (DAF or CD55). Using the newly solved three-dimensional structure of AfaE, we have constructed a robust atomic resolution model that reveals the structural basis for assembly by donor strand complementation and for the architecture of capped surface fibers."
11163217,Modulation of host signaling by a bacterial mimic: structure of the Salmonella effector SptP bound to Rac1.,"Salmonella spp. utilize a specialized protein secretion system to deliver a battery of effector proteins into host cells. Several of these effectors stimulate Cdc42- and Rac1-dependent cytoskeletal changes that promote bacterial internalization. These potentially cytotoxic alterations are rapidly reversed by the effector SptP, a tyrosine phosphatase and GTPase activating protein (GAP) that targets Cdc42 and Rac1. The 2.3 A resolution crystal structure of an SptP-Rac1 transition state complex reveals an unusual GAP architecture that mimics host functional homologs. The phosphatase domain possesses a conserved active site but distinct surface properties. Binding to Rac1 induces a dramatic stabilization in SptP of a four-helix bundle that makes extensive contacts with the Switch I and Switch II regions of the GTPase."
20377878,"Structure, localization and histone binding properties of nuclear-associated nucleosome assembly protein from Plasmodium falciparum.",Nucleosome assembly proteins (NAPs) are histone chaperones that are crucial for the shuttling and incorporation of histones into nucleosomes. NAPs participate in the assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes thus contributing to chromatin structure organization. The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains two nucleosome assembly proteins termed PfNapL and PfNapS.
11807546,Structural basis for the activation of anthrax adenylyl cyclase exotoxin by calmodulin.,"Oedema factor, a calmodulin-activated adenylyl cyclase, is important in the pathogenesis of anthrax. Here we report the X-ray structures of oedema factor with and without bound calmodulin. Oedema factor shares no significant structural homology with mammalian adenylyl cyclases or other proteins. In the active site, 3'-deoxy-ATP and a single metal ion are well positioned for catalysis with histidine 351 as the catalytic base. This mechanism differs from the mechanism of two-metal-ion catalysis proposed for mammalian adenylyl cyclases. Four discrete regions of oedema factor form a surface that recognizes an extended conformation of calmodulin, which is very different from the collapsed conformation observed in other structures of calmodulin bound to effector peptides. On calmodulin binding, an oedema factor helical domain of relative molecular mass 15,000 undergoes a 15 A translation and a 30 degrees rotation away from the oedema factor catalytic core, which stabilizes a disordered loop and leads to enzyme activation. These allosteric changes provide the first molecular details of how calmodulin modulates one of its targets."
12485993,Physiological calcium concentrations regulate calmodulin binding and catalysis of adenylyl cyclase exotoxins.,"Edema factor (EF) and CyaA are calmodulin (CaM)-activated adenylyl cyclase exotoxins involved in the pathogenesis of anthrax and whooping cough, respectively. Using spectroscopic, enzyme kinetic and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy analyses, we show that low Ca(2+) concentrations increase the affinity of CaM for EF and CyaA causing their activation, but higher Ca(2+) concentrations directly inhibit catalysis. Both events occur in a physiologically relevant range of Ca(2+) concentrations. Despite the similarity in Ca(2+) sensitivity, EF and CyaA have substantial differences in CaM binding and activation. CyaA has 100-fold higher affinity for CaM than EF. CaM has N- and C-terminal globular domains, each binding two Ca(2+) ions. CyaA can be fully activated by CaM mutants with one defective C-terminal Ca(2+)-binding site or by either terminal domain of CaM while EF cannot. EF consists of a catalytic core and a helical domain, and both are required for CaM activation of EF. Mutations that decrease the interaction of the helical domain with the catalytic core create an enzyme with higher sensitivity to Ca(2+)-CaM activation. However, CyaA is fully activated by CaM without the domain corresponding to the helical domain of EF."
15719022,Calcium-independent calmodulin binding and two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism of anthrax edema factor.,"Edema factor (EF), a key anthrax exotoxin, has an anthrax protective antigen-binding domain (PABD) and a calmodulin (CaM)-activated adenylyl cyclase domain. Here, we report the crystal structures of CaM-bound EF, revealing the architecture of EF PABD. CaM has N- and C-terminal domains and each domain can bind two calcium ions. Calcium binding induces the conformational change of CaM from closed to open. Structures of the EF-CaM complex show how EF locks the N-terminal domain of CaM into a closed conformation regardless of its calcium-loading state. This represents a mechanism of how CaM effector alters the calcium affinity of CaM and uncouples the conformational change of CaM from calcium loading. Furthermore, structures of EF-CaM complexed with nucleotides show that EF uses two-metal-ion catalysis, a prevalent mechanism in DNA and RNA polymerases. A histidine (H351) further facilitates the catalysis of EF by activating a water to deprotonate 3'OH of ATP. Mammalian adenylyl cyclases share no structural similarity with EF and they also use two-metal-ion catalysis, suggesting the catalytic mechanism-driven convergent evolution of two structurally diverse adenylyl cyclases."
14978283,"Selective inhibition of anthrax edema factor by adefovir, a drug for chronic hepatitis B virus infection.","Edema factor (EF), a key virulence factor in anthrax pathogenesis, has calmodulin (CaM)-activated adenylyl cyclase activity. We have found that adefovir dipivoxil, a drug approved to treat chronic infection of hepatitis B virus, effectively inhibits EF-induced cAMP accumulation and changes in cytokine production in mouse primary macrophages. Adefovir diphosphate (PMEApp), the active cellular metabolite of adefovir dipivoxil, inhibits the adenylyl cyclase activity of EF in vitro with high affinity (K(i) = 27 nM). A crystal structure of EF-CaM-PMEApp reveals that the catalytic site of EF forms better van der Waals contacts and more hydrogen bonds with PMEApp than with its endogenous substrate, ATP, providing an explanation for the approximately 10,000-fold higher affinity EF-CaM has for PMEApp versus ATP. Adefovir dipivoxil is a clinically approved drug that can block the action of an anthrax toxin. It can be used to address the role of EF in anthrax pathogenesis."
15063758,"Structure of anthrax edema factor-calmodulin-adenosine 5'-(alpha,beta-methylene)-triphosphate complex reveals an alternative mode of ATP binding to the catalytic site.","Anthrax edema factor (EF) is a key virulence factor secreted by Bacillus anthracis. Here, we report a structure, at 3.0 A resolution, of the catalytic domain of EF (EF3) in complex with calmodulin (CaM) and adenosine 5'-(alpha,beta-methylene)-triphosphate (AMPCPP). Although the binding of the triphosphate of AMPCPP to EF3 can be superimposed on that of previously determined 3'deoxy-ATP (3'dATP) and 2'deoxy 3' anthraniloyl-ATP (2'd3' ANT-ATP) in EF3-CaM, the ribose and the adenine rings of AMPCPP are rotated approximately 105 and 180 degrees, respectively, relative to those of 3'dATP and 2'd3'ANT-ATP. Based on this model, K382 and F586 should play key roles in the recognition of adenine. However, mutations of these residues to alanine either separately or together cause only modest changes in Michaelis-Menten constants and IC50 values of AMPCPP and cAMP. Therefore, this alternate binding mode of the adenosine of AMPCPP binds to EF likely playing only a minor role in ATP binding and in catalysis."
15131111,Structural and kinetic analyses of the interaction of anthrax adenylyl cyclase toxin with reaction products cAMP and pyrophosphate.,"Anthrax edema factor (EF) raises host intracellular cAMP to pathological levels through a calcium-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity. Here we report the structure of EF.CaM in complex with its reaction products, cAMP and PP(i). Mutational analysis confirmed the interaction of EF with cAMP and PP(i) as depicted in the structural model. While both cAMP and PP(i) have access to solvent channels to exit independently, PP(i) is likely released first. EF can synthesize ATP from cAMP and PP(i), and the estimated rate constants of this reaction at two physiologically relevant calcium concentrations were similar to those of adenylyl cyclase activity of EF. Comparison of the conformation of adenosine in the structures of EF.CaM.cAMP.PP(i) with EF.CaM.3.dATP revealed about 160 degrees rotation in the torsion angle of N-glycosyl bond from the +anti conformation in 3.dATP to -syn in cAMP; such a rotation could serve to distinguish against substrates with the N-2 amino group of purine. The catalytic rate of EF for ITP was about 2 orders of magnitude better than that for GTP, supporting the potential role of this rotation in substrate selectivity of EF. The anomalous difference Fourier map revealed that two ytterbium ions (Yb(3+)) could bind the catalytic site of EF.CaM in the presence of cAMP and PP(i), suggesting the presence of two magnesium ions at the catalytic site of EF. We hypothesize that EF could use a ""histidine and two-metal ion"" hybrid mechanism to facilitate the cyclization reaction."
14962388,Crystal structure of Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen complexed with HLA-DR1 reveals a novel superantigen fold and a dimerized superantigen-MHC complex.,"Mycoplasma arthritidis-derived mitogen (MAM) is a superantigen that can activate large fractions of T cells bearing particular TCR Vbeta elements. Here we report the crystal structure of MAM complexed with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen, HLA-DR1, loaded with haemagglutinin peptide 306-318 (HA). The structure reveals that MAM has a novel fold composed of two alpha-helical domains. This fold is entirely different from that of the pyrogenic superantigens, consisting of a beta-grasped motif and a beta barrel. In the complex, the N-terminal domain of MAM binds orthogonally to the MHC alpha1 domain and the bound HA peptide, and to a lesser extent to the MHC beta1 domain. Two MAM molecules form an asymmetric dimer and cross-link two MHC antigens to form a plausible, dimerized MAM-MHC complex. These data provide the first crystallographic evidence that superantigens can dimerize MHC molecules. Based on our structure, a model of the TCR2MAM2MHC2 complex is proposed."
10856233,Crystal structure of a gamma-herpesvirus cyclin-cdk complex.,"Several gamma-herpesviruses encode proteins related to the mammalian cyclins, regulatory subunits of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) essential for cell cycle progression. We report a 2.5 A crystal structure of a full-length oncogenic viral cyclin from gamma-herpesvirus 68 complexed with cdk2. The viral cyclin binds cdk2 with an orientation different from cyclin A and makes several novel interactions at the interface, yet it activates cdk2 by triggering conformational changes similar to cyclin A. Sequences within the viral cyclin N-terminus lock part of the cdk2 T-loop within the core of the complex. These sequences and others are conserved amongst the viral and cellular D-type cyclins, suggesting that this structure has wider implications for other cyclin-cdk complexes. The observed resistance of this viral cyclin-cdk complex to inhibition by the p27(KIP:) cdk inhibitor is explained by sequence and conformational variation in the cyclin rendering the p27(KIP:)-binding site on the cyclin subunit non-functional."
11432818,Crystal structure of a superantigen bound to MHC class II displays zinc and peptide dependence.,"The three-dimensional structure of a bacterial superantigen, Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin H (SEH), bound to human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (HLA-DR1) has been determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.6 A resolution (1HXY). The superantigen binds on top of HLA-DR1 in a completely different way from earlier co-crystallized superantigens from S.aureus. SEH interacts with high affinity through a zinc ion with the beta1 chain of HLA-DR1 and also with the peptide presented by HLA-DR1. The structure suggests that all superantigens interacting with MHC class II in a zinc-dependent manner present the superantigen in a common way. This suggests a new model for ternary complex formation with the T-cell receptor (TCR), in which a contact between the TCR and the MHC class II is unlikely."
11081631,"Structural basis for the recognition of DNA repair proteins UNG2, XPA, and RAD52 by replication factor RPA.","Replication protein A (RPA), the nuclear ssDNA-binding protein in eukaryotes, is essential to DNA replication, recombination, and repair. We have shown that a globular domain at the C terminus of subunit RPA32 contains a specific surface that interacts in a similar manner with the DNA repair enzyme UNG2 and repair factors XPA and RAD52, each of which functions in a different repair pathway. NMR structures of the RPA32 domain, free and in complex with the minimal interaction domain of UNG2, were determined, defining a common structural basis for linking RPA to the nucleotide excision, base excision, and recombinational pathways of repairing damaged DNA. Our findings support a hand-off model for the assembly and coordination of different components of the DNA repair machinery."
12526809,"Structure of internalin, a major invasion protein of Listeria monocytogenes, in complex with its human receptor E-cadherin.","Listeria monocytogenes, a food-borne bacterial pathogen, enters mammalian cells by inducing its own phagocytosis. The listerial protein internalin (InlA) mediates bacterial adhesion and invasion of epithelial cells in the human intestine through specific interaction with its host cell receptor E-cadherin. We present the crystal structures of the functional domain of InlA alone and in a complex with the extracellular, N-terminal domain of human E-cadherin (hEC1). The leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain of InlA surrounds and specifically recognizes hEC1. Individual interactions were probed by mutagenesis and analytical ultracentrifugation. These include Pro16 of hEC1, a major determinant for human susceptibility to L. monocytogenes infection that is essential for intermolecular recognition. Our studies reveal the structural basis for host tro-pism of this bacterium and the molecular deception L. monocytogenes employs to exploit the E-cadherin system."
10843695,The structure and stability of an HLA-A*0201/octameric tax peptide complex with an empty conserved peptide-N-terminal binding site.,"The crystal structure of the human class I MHC molecule HLA-A2 complexed with of an octameric peptide, Tax8 (LFGYPVYV), from human T cell lymphotrophic virus-1 (HTLV-1) has been determined. This structure is compared with a newly refined, higher resolution (1.8 A) structure of HLA-A2 complexed with the nonameric Tax9 peptide (LLFGYPVYV) with one more N-terminal residue. Despite the absence of a peptide residue (P1) bound in the conserved N-terminal peptide-binding pocket of the Tax8/HLA-A2 complex, the structures of the two complexes are essentially identical. Water molecules in the Tax8 complex replace the terminal amino group of the Tax9 peptide and mediate a network of hydrogen bonds among the secondary structural elements at that end of the peptide-binding groove. Thermal denaturation measurements indicate that the Tax8 complex is much less stable, DeltaTm = 16 degrees C, than the Tax9 complex, but both can sensitize target cells for lysis by some Tax-specific CTL from HTLV-1 infected individuals. The absence of a P1 peptide residue is thus not enough to prevent formation of a ""closed conformation"" of the peptide-binding site. TCR affinity measurements and cytotoxic T cell assays indicate that the Tax8/HLA-A2 complex does not functionally cross-react with the A6-TCR-bearing T cell clone specific for Tax9/HLA-A2 complexes."
11333901,Human cytomegalovirus US2 endoplasmic reticulum-lumenal domain dictates association with major histocompatibility complex class I in a locus-specific manner.,"The human cytomegalovirus-encoded US2 glycoprotein targets endoplasmic reticulum-resident major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I heavy chains for rapid degradation by the proteasome. We demonstrate that the endoplasmic reticulum-lumenal domain of US2 allows tight interaction with class I molecules encoded by the HLA-A locus. Recombinant soluble US2 binds properly folded, peptide-containing recombinant HLA-A2 molecules in a peptide sequence-independent manner, consistent with US2's ability to broadly downregulate class I molecules. The physicochemical properties of the US2/MHC class I complex suggest a 1:1 stoichiometry. These results demonstrate that US2 does not require additional cellular proteins to specifically interact with soluble class I molecules. Binding of US2 does not significantly alter the conformation of class I molecules, as a soluble T-cell receptor can simultaneously recognize class I molecules associated with US2. The lumenal domain of US2 can differentiate between the products of distinct class I loci, as US2 binds several HLA-A locus products while being unable to bind recombinant HLA-B7, HLA-B27, HLA-Cw4, or HLA-E. We did not observe interaction between soluble US2 and either recombinant HLA-DR1 or recombinant HLA-DM. The substrate specificity of US2 may help explain the presence in human cytomegalovirus of multiple strategies for downregulation of MHC class I molecules."
11391001,Antigen presentation subverted: Structure of the human cytomegalovirus protein US2 bound to the class I molecule HLA-A2.,"Many persistent viruses have evolved the ability to subvert MHC class I antigen presentation. Indeed, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes at least four proteins that down-regulate cell-surface expression of class I. The HCMV unique short (US)2 glycoprotein binds newly synthesized class I molecules within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequently targets them for proteasomal degradation. We report the crystal structure of US2 bound to the HLA-A2/Tax peptide complex. US2 associates with HLA-A2 at the junction of the peptide-binding region and the alpha3 domain, a novel binding surface on class I that allows US2 to bind independently of peptide sequence. Mutation of class I heavy chains confirms the importance of this binding site in vivo. Available data on class I-ER chaperone interactions indicate that chaperones would not impede US2 binding. Unexpectedly, the US2 ER-luminal domain forms an Ig-like fold. A US2 structure-based sequence alignment reveals that seven HCMV proteins, at least three of which function in immune evasion, share the same fold as US2. The structure allows design of further experiments to determine how US2 targets class I molecules for degradation."
8945469,Sec61-mediated transfer of a membrane protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the proteasome for destruction.,"The human cytomegalovirus genome encodes proteins that trigger destruction of newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The human cytomegalovirus gene US2 specifies a product capable of dislocating MHC class I molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol and delivering them to the proteasome. This process involves the Sec61 complex, in what appears to be a reversal of the reaction by which it translocates nascent chains into the endoplasmic reticulum."
15380363,Hepatitis C virus core protein regulates p300/CBP co-activation function. Possible role in the regulation of NF-AT1 transcriptional activity.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core is a viral structural protein; it also participates in some cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation. However, the mechanisms of core-mediated transcriptional regulation remain poorly understood. Oncogenic virus proteins often target p300/CBP, a known co-activator of a wide variety of transcription factors, to regulate the expression of cellular and viral genes. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that HCV core protein interacts with p300/CBP and enhances both its acetyl-transferase and transcriptional activities. In addition, we demonstrate that nuclear core protein activates the NH2-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) of NF-AT1 in a p300/CBP-dependent manner. We propose a model in which core protein regulates the co-activation function of p300/CBP and activates NF-AT1, and probably other p300/CBP-regulated transcription factors, by a novel mechanism involving the regulation of the acetylation state of histones and/or components of the transcriptional machinery."
15834423,CtBP represses p300-mediated transcriptional activation by direct association with its bromodomain.,"Histone acetyltransferase coactivators bind to acetylated histones through their bromodomains and catalyze the acetylation of histone H3 and H4 tails for transcriptional activation. C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) serves as a transcriptional corepressor by recruiting histone deacetylases. However, the precise mechanism by which CtBP represses transcription has not been determined. In this study we found that CtBP1 directly associates with p300 by binding to the PXDLS motif in the bromodomain of p300. Moreover, CtBP1 blocks the accessibility of p300 to histones in an NADH-sensitive manner and thus represses p300-mediated histone acetylation and transcriptional activation. In addition, an NADH-nonresponsive, monomeric mutant, CtBP1 (G183V), was found to strongly repress p300-mediated transcriptional activation. Thus, the dissociation of NADH from CtBP1 leads to the repression of p300-driven general transcriptional activity by CtBP1. These results suggest a novel mechanism whereby CtBP1 serves as an energy-sensing repressor of histone acetyltransferase(s) and thus affects general transcription."
10964507,Heat-shock protein 70 can replace viral protein R of HIV-1 during nuclear import of the viral preintegration complex.,"Heat-shock proteins (Hsp's) are a family of molecular chaperones that contribute to protection from environmental stress. In this report, we demonstrate that a member of this family, Hsp70, facilitates nuclear import of HIV-1 preintegration complexes (PICs). The mechanism of this activity appears to be similar to the one used by Vpr, an HIV-1 protein regulating viral nuclear import and replication in macrophages. Indeed Hsp70 stimulated binding of HIV-1 matrix antigen to GST-karyopherin alpha fusion protein and rescued nuclear import of a Vpr-defective HIV-1 strain in vitro. Binding studies with truncated forms of GST-karyopherin alpha demonstrated that both Vpr and Hsp70 bind to a region in the amino-terminal part of the karyopherin alpha molecule. This region appears to be distinct from the binding sites for two other karyopherin alpha cargoes, basic-type NLS-containing proteins and transcription factor STAT-1. Vpr competed with Hsp70 for binding to karyopherin alpha. These results suggest the presence of a novel regulatory site on karyopherin alpha which is used by Hsp70 and Vpr to stimulate interaction between the HIV-1 PIC and karyopherin alpha and thus promote viral nuclear import."
9891055,The arginine-rich domains present in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat and Rev function as direct importin beta-dependent nuclear localization signals.,"Protein nuclear import is generally mediated by basic nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that serve as targets for the importin alpha (Imp alpha) NLS receptor. Imp alpha is in turn bound by importin beta (Imp beta), which targets the resultant protein complex to the nucleus. Here, we report that the arginine-rich NLS sequences present in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 regulatory proteins Tat and Rev fail to interact with Imp alpha and instead bind directly to Imp beta. Using in vitro nuclear import assays, we demonstrate that Imp alpha is entirely dispensable for Tat and Rev nuclear import. In contrast, Imp beta proved both sufficient and necessary, in that other beta-like import factors, such as transportin, were unable to support Tat or Rev nuclear import. Using in vitro competition assays, it was demonstrated that the target sites on Imp beta for Imp alpha, Tat, and Rev binding either are identical or at least overlap. The interaction of Tat and Rev with Imp beta is also similar to Imp alpha binding in that it is inhibited by RanGTP but not RanGDP, a finding that may in part explain why the interaction of the Rev nuclear RNA export factor with target RNA species is efficient in the cell nucleus yet is released in the cytoplasm. Together, these studies define a novel class of arginine-rich NLS sequences that are direct targets for Imp beta and that therefore function independently of Imp alpha."
9343168,Identification of domains within the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early 86-kilodalton protein and the retinoblastoma protein required for physical and functional interaction with each other.,"The human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early 86-kDa protein (IE2 86) plays an important role in the trans activation and regulation of HCMV gene expression. Previously, we demonstrated that IE2 86 contains three regions (amino acids [aa] 86 to 135, 136 to 290, and 291 to 364) that can independently bind to in vitro-translated Rb when IE2 86 is produced as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (M. H. Sommer, A. L. Scully, and D. H. Spector, J. Virol. 68:6223-6231, 1994). In this report, we have elucidated the regions of Rb involved in binding to IE2 86 and have further analyzed the functional nature of the interaction between these two proteins. We find that two domains on Rb, the A/B pocket and the carboxy terminus, can each independently form a complex with IE2 86. In functional assays, we demonstrate that IE2 86 and another IE protein, IE1 72, can counter the enlarged flat cell phenotype, but not the G1/S block, which results from expression of wild-type Rb in the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2. Mutational analysis reveals that there are two domains on IE2 86 that can independently affect Rb function. One region (aa 241 to 369) includes the major Rb-binding domain, while the second maps to the amino-terminal region (aa 1 to 85) common to both IE2 86 and IE1 72. These data show that Rb and IE2 86 physically and functionally interact with each other via at least two separate domains and provide further support for the hypothesis that IE2 86 may exert its pleiotropic effects through the formation of multimeric protein complexes."
7537362,"Molecular interactions of the Src homology 2 domain protein Shb with phosphotyrosine residues, tyrosine kinase receptors and Src homology 3 domain proteins.","The molecular interactions of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and the N-terminal proline-rich sequence motifs (pro-1 to pro-5) of the SH2 protein Shb with other components were presently characterised. Using a degenerate phosphopeptide library the preferred binding site for the Shb SH2 domain was determined to pTyr-Thr/Val/Ile-X-Leu at positions +1 to +3 relative the phosphotyrosine residue. Experiments with competing peptides and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta-receptor mutants with Y to F substitutions in autophosphorylation sites revealed multiple binding sites for the Shb SH2 domain in the receptor. The Shb SH2 domain also binds to in vitro phosphorylated fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) mainly through position Y776. The receptor experiments suggest that other residues besides the +1 to +3 positions may also be of significance for Shb binding. The pro-4/pro-5 motif of Shb binds in vitro particularly well to the Src, p85 alpha PI3-kinase and Eps8 SH3 domains expressed as GST fusion proteins. However, the GST-SH3 domain fusion proteins tested bind in vitro to peptides corresponding to the pro-1 to pro-5 motifs of Shb with low affinity and selectivity, suggesting that sequences outside the core proline motif may also be important for Shb-SH3 domain interactions. In vivo association between Shb-SH3 domain proteins v-Src and Eps8 was detected by coimmunoprecipitation. PDGF treatment did not affect the association between Eps8 and Shb. The data suggest that Shb is an adaptor protein linking SH3 domain proteins to tyrosine kinases or other tyrosine phosphorylated proteins."
15117959,Herpes simplex virus type 1 capsid protein VP26 interacts with dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1 and plays a role in retrograde cellular transport.,"Cytoplasmic dynein is the major molecular motor involved in minus-end-directed cellular transport along microtubules. There is increasing evidence that the retrograde transport of herpes simplex virus type 1 along sensory axons is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein, but the viral and cellular proteins involved are not known. Here we report that the herpes simplex virus outer capsid protein VP26 interacts with dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1 and is sufficient to mediate retrograde transport of viral capsids in a cellular model. A library of herpes simplex virus capsid and tegument structural genes was constructed and tested for interactions with dynein subunits in a yeast two-hybrid system. A strong interaction was detected between VP26 and the homologous 14-kDa dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1. In vitro pull-down assays confirmed binding of VP26 to RP3, Tctex1, and intact cytoplasmic dynein complexes. Recombinant herpes simplex virus capsids were constructed either with or without VP26. In pull-down assays VP26+ capsids bound to RP3; VP26-capsids did not. To investigate intracellular transport, the recombinant viral capsids were microinjected into living cells and incubated at 37 degrees C. After 1 h VP26+ capsids were observed to co-localize with RP3, Tctex1, and microtubules. After 2 or 4 h VP26+ capsids had moved closer to the cell nucleus, whereas VP26-capsids remained in a random distribution. We propose that VP26 mediates binding of incoming herpes simplex virus capsids to cytoplasmic dynein during cellular infection, through interactions with dynein light chains."
20585571,Human cytomegalovirus UL29/28 protein interacts with components of the NuRD complex which promote accumulation of immediate-early RNA.,"Histone deacetylation plays a pivotal role in regulating human cytomegalovirus gene expression. In this report, we have identified candidate HDAC1-interacting proteins in the context of infection by using a method for rapid immunoisolation of an epitope-tagged protein coupled with mass spectrometry. Putative interactors included multiple human cytomegalovirus-coded proteins. In particular, the interaction of pUL38 and pUL29/28 with HDAC1 was confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitations. HDAC1 is present in numerous protein complexes, including the HDAC1-containing nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase protein complex, NuRD. pUL38 and pUL29/28 associated with the MTA2 component of NuRD, and shRNA-mediated knockdown of the RBBP4 and CHD4 constituents of NuRD inhibited HCMV immediate-early RNA and viral DNA accumulation; together this argues that multiple components of the NuRD complex are needed for efficient HCMV replication. Consistent with a positive acting role for the NuRD elements during viral replication, the growth of pUL29/28- or pUL38-deficient viruses could not be rescued by treating infected cells with the deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A. Transient expression of pUL29/28 enhanced activity of the HCMV major immediate-early promoter in a reporter assay, regardless of pUL38 expression. Importantly, induction of the major immediate-early reporter activity by pUL29/28 required functional NuRD components, consistent with the inhibition of immediate-early RNA accumulation within infected cells after knockdown of RBBP4 and CHD4. We propose that pUL29/28 modifies the NuRD complex to stimulate the accumulation of immediate-early RNAs."
11747608,The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) interacts with dengue virus core protein.,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a component of hnRNP particles, is involved in several steps of gene expression regulation. Dengue (DEN) virus, a member of the Flaviviridae, is the primary cause of illnesses such as dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. In mature DEN virus particles, the core protein is a structural protein that forms a nucleocapsid complex with genomic RNA. Very little of its biologic functions is known. Here, using an in vitro binding assay and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, we report a protein-protein interaction between the DEN virus core protein and hnRNP K. The C-terminal hydrophilic region of the DEN virus core protein, spanning amino acid residues 73 to 100, is required for such interaction. Results of glutathione-S transferase binding assays indicated that the core protein-hnRNP K interaction might be abolished in the presence of hnRNP K cognate nucleic acids. Furthermore, in a cotransfection experiment, the repressive effect of hnRNP K on C/EBPbeta-mediated transcription activation could be reversed by full-length DEN virus core protein but not by a truncated form containing amino acids 1-72. Our results suggest that, on DEN virus infection, the multiple functions of cellular hnRNP K may be affected by the virus core protein."
12663780,Human cytomegalovirus US3 chimeras containing US2 cytosolic residues acquire major histocompatibility class I and II protein degradation properties.,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) glycoprotein US2 increases the proteasome-mediated degradation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I heavy chain (HC), class II DR-alpha and DM-alpha proteins, and HFE, a nonclassical MHC protein. US2-initiated degradation of MHC proteins apparently involves the recruitment of cellular proteins that participate in a process known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation. ER-associated degradation is a normal process by which misfolded proteins are recognized and translocated into the cytoplasm for degradation by proteasomes. It has been demonstrated that truncated forms of US2, especially those lacking the cytoplasmic domain (CT), can bind MHC proteins but do not cause their degradation. To further assess how the US2 CT domain interacts with the cellular components of the ER-associated degradation pathway, we constructed chimeric proteins in which the US2 CT domain or the CT and transmembrane (TM) domains replaced those of the HCMV glycoprotein US3. US3 also binds both class I and II proteins but does not cause their degradation. Remarkably, chimeras containing the US2 CT domain caused the degradation of both MHC class I and II proteins although this degradation was less than that by wild-type US2. Therefore, the US2 CT and TM domains can confer on US3 the capacity to degrade MHC proteins. We also analyzed complexes containing MHC proteins and US2, US3, US11, or US3/US2 chimeras for the presence of cdc48/p97 ATPase, a protein that binds polyubiquitinated proteins and likely functions in the extraction of substrates from the ER membrane before the substrates meet proteasomes. p97 ATPase was present in immunoprecipitates containing US2, US11, and two chimeras that included the US2 CT domain, but not in US3 complexes. Therefore, it appears that the CT domain of US2 participates in recruiting p97 ATPase into ER-associated degradation complexes."
19515779,Vpu directs the degradation of the human immunodeficiency virus restriction factor BST-2/Tetherin via a {beta}TrCP-dependent mechanism.,"The primary roles attributed to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu protein are the degradation of the viral receptor CD4 and the enhancement of virion release. With regard to CD4 downregulation, Vpu has been shown to act as an adapter linking CD4 with the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery via interaction with the F-box protein betaTrCP. To identify additional cellular betaTrCP-dependent Vpu targets, we performed quantitative proteomics analyses using the plasma membrane fraction of HeLa cells expressing either wild-type Vpu or a Vpu mutant (S52N/S56N) that does not bind betaTrCP. One cellular protein, BST-2 (CD317), was consistently underrepresented in the membrane proteome of cells expressing wild-type Vpu compared to the proteome of cells expressing the Vpu mutant. To verify the biological relevance of this phenotype for HIV pathogenesis, we showed that in T cells infected with HIV-1, BST-2 downregulation occurred in a Vpu-dependent manner. Recently, BST-2 has been identified as the interferon-inducible cellular factor Tetherin, which restricts HIV virion release in the absence of Vpu. We address here the unresolved mechanism of Vpu-mediated BST-2 downregulation. Our data show that the presence of wild-type Vpu reduced cell surface and total steady-state BST-2 levels, whereas that of the mutant Vpu had no effect. In addition, treatment of cells with the lysosome acidification inhibitor concanamycin A, but not treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, reduced BST-2 downregulation by wild-type Vpu, thereby suggesting that the presence of Vpu leads to the degradation of BST-2 via an endosome-lysosome degradation pathway. The importance of betaTrCP in this process was confirmed by demonstrating that in the absence of betaTrCP, BST-2 levels were restored despite the presence of Vpu. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that, in similarity to its role in CD4 degradation, Vpu acts as an adapter molecule linking BST-2 to the cellular ubiquitination machinery via betaTrCP. However, in contrast to the proteasome-dependent degradation of CD4, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, Vpu appears to interact with BST-2 in the trans-Golgi network or in early endosomes, leading to lysosomal degradation of BST-2. Via this action, Vpu could counter the tethering function of BST-2, resulting in enhanced HIV-1 virion release. Interestingly, although HIV-2 does not express Vpu, an isolate known to exhibit enhanced viral egress can downregulate surface BST-2 by an as-yet-unknown mechanism that does not appear to involve degradation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of both Vpu-dependent and -independent mediated antagonism of BST-2 will be critical for therapeutic strategies that exploit this novel viral function."
20179761,A flow cytometry-based FRET assay to identify and analyse protein-protein interactions in living cells.,"Försters resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy is widely used for the analysis of protein interactions in intact cells. However, FRET microscopy is technically challenging and does not allow assessing interactions in large cell numbers. To overcome these limitations we developed a flow cytometry-based FRET assay and analysed interactions of human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) Nef and Vpu proteins with cellular factors, as well as HIV Rev multimer-formation."
8647104,Non-structural protein 3 of hepatitis C virus inhibits phosphorylation mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.,"Inspection of the amino acid sequence of the non-structural region of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) gene product reveals a sequence of 14 amino acids, Arg1487-Arg-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Gly-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ile-Tyr-Arg1500 , located in the non-structural protein, NS3. This sequence is highly similar to the inhibitory site of the heat-stable inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and to the autophosphorylation site in the hinge region of the PKA type II regulatory domain. A synthetic peptide that corresponds to the HCV sequence above and a set of shorter analogues act as competitive inhibitors of PKA. A 43.5-kDa fragment of NS3 that consists of residues 1189-1525 of the HCV polyprotein inhibits PKA in a similar range to the investigated synthetic peptides. In contrast to the short peptides, which show competitive inhibition, HCV-polyprotein-(1189-1525) influences PKA in a mixed-inhibition-type manner. A possible mechanism explaining these differences is the formation of complexes that consist of the protein substrate, the enzyme and the HCV-polyprotein-(1189-1525). Binding studies with PKA and the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue [14C]fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine and [3H]cAMP do not reveal any influence of the short HCV-derived peptides or HCV-polyprotein-(1189-1525) upon the affinity of PKA for these nucleotides. The complex interactions of the NS3 fragments could influence one of the most important signal pathways of the cell and, therefore, could possibly provide new pathological mechanisms for HCV infections of liver."
17445772,Involvement of the betaTrCP in the ubiquitination and stability of the HIV-1 Vpu protein.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu protein binds to the CD4 receptor and targets it to the proteasome for degradation. This process requires the recruitment of human betaTrCP, a component of the Skp1-Cullin-F box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, that interacts with phosphorylated Vpu molecules. Vpu, unlike other ligands of betaTrCP, has never been reported to be degraded. We provide evidence that Vpu, itself, is ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation by the proteasome. We demonstrate that the mutant Vpu2.6, which cannot interact with betaTrCP, is stable and, unlike wild-type Vpu, is not polyubiquitinated. These results suggest that betaTrCP is involved in Vpu polyubiquitination."
20442859,Multilayered mechanism of CD4 downregulation by HIV-1 Vpu involving distinct ER retention and ERAD targeting steps.,"A key function of the Vpu protein of HIV-1 is the targeting of newly-synthesized CD4 for proteasomal degradation. This function has been proposed to occur by a mechanism that is fundamentally distinct from the cellular ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. However, using a combination of genetic, biochemical and morphological methodologies, we find that CD4 degradation induced by Vpu is dependent on a key component of the ERAD machinery, the VCP-UFD1L-NPL4 complex, as well as on SCF(beta-TrCP)-dependent ubiquitination of the CD4 cytosolic tail on lysine and serine/threonine residues. When degradation of CD4 is blocked by either inactivation of the VCP-UFD1L-NPL4 complex or prevention of CD4 ubiquitination, Vpu still retains the bulk of CD4 in the ER mainly through transmembrane domain interactions. Addition of a strong ER export signal from the VSV-G protein overrides this retention. Thus, Vpu exerts two distinct activities in the process of downregulating CD4: ER retention followed by targeting to late stages of ERAD. The multiple levels at which Vpu engages these cellular quality control mechanisms underscore the importance of ensuring profound suppression of CD4 to the life cycle of HIV-1."
11226577,Hepatitis C virus core protein potentiates c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation through a signaling complex involving TRADD and TRAF2.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is a multifunctional viral nucleocapsid protein. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the HCV core protein interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). Since the TNFR1 is engaged in stimulation of transcriptional factor NF-kappaB and AP-1 through activation of IkappaB kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, or stress-activated protein kinase), respectively, we have examined whether the interaction between core protein and TNFR1 can modulate JNK. In this study, we demonstrate that the HCV core protein synergistically activates TNFalpha-induced JNK at a core concentration dependent manner in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. HCV core-mediated synergism of JNK activation was also detected in stable cells expressing HCV core protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HCV core protein does not compete with TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) for its interaction with the death domain of TNFR1. Our in vivo data show that HCV core and TRADD form a ternary complex with TNFR1. These findings suggest that the HCV core protein modulates TNFR1 signaling and may, thus, play a role in chronic infection of HCV patients."
10893422,E3KARP mediates the association of ezrin and protein kinase A with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in airway cells.,"Although it is generally recognized that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) contains a PSD-95/Disc-large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding motif at its COOH terminus, the identity of the PDZ domain protein(s) that interact with CFTR is uncertain, and the functional impact of this interaction is not fully understood. By using human airway epithelial cells, we show that CFTR associates with Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) type 3 kinase A regulatory protein (E3KARP), an EBP50/NHE regulatory factor (NHERF)-related PDZ domain protein. The PDZ binding motif located at the COOH terminus of CFTR interacts preferentially with the second PDZ domain of E3KARP, with nanomolar affinity. In contrast to EBP50/NHERF, E3KARP is predominantly localized (>95%) in the membrane fractions of Calu-3 and T84 cells, where CFTR is located. Moreover, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of polarized Calu-3 monolayers shows that E3KARP and CFTR are co-localized at the apical membrane domain. We also found that ezrin associates with E3KARP in vivo. Co-expression of CFTR with E3KARP and ezrin in Xenopus oocytes potentiated cAMP-stimulated CFTR Cl(-) currents. These results support the concept that E3KARP functions as a scaffold protein that links CFTR to ezrin. Since ezrin has been shown previously to function as a protein kinase A anchoring protein, we suggest that one function served by the interaction of E3KARP with both ezrin and CFTR is to localize protein kinase A in the vicinity of the R-domain of CFTR. Since ezrin is also an actin-binding protein, the formation of a CFTR.E3KARP.ezrin complex may be important also in stabilizing CFTR at the apical membrane domain of airway cells."
9573291,Functional interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu and Gag with a novel member of the tetratricopeptide repeat protein family.,"Viral protein U (Vpu) is a protein encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that promotes the degradation of the virus receptor, CD4, and enhances the release of virus particles from cells. We isolated a cDNA that encodes a novel cellular protein that interacts with Vpu in vitro, in vivo, and in yeast cells. This Vpu-binding protein (UBP) has a molecular mass of 41 kDa and is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues at the RNA level. UBP is a novel member of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein family containing four copies of the 34-amino-acid TPR motif. Other proteins that contain TPR motifs include members of the immunophilin superfamily, organelle-targeting proteins, and a protein phosphatase. UBP also interacts directly with HIV-1 Gag protein, the principal structural component of the viral capsid. However, when Vpu and Gag are coexpressed, stable interaction between UBP and Gag is diminished. Furthermore, overexpression of UBP in virus-producing cells resulted in a significant reduction in HIV-1 virion release. Taken together, these data indicate that UBP plays a role in Vpu-mediated enhancement of particle release."
15247912,Staphylococcus aureus protein A induces airway epithelial inflammatory responses by activating TNFR1.,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that is associated with diverse types of local and systemic infection characterized by inflammation dominated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Staphylococci frequently cause pneumonia, and these clinical isolates often have increased expression of protein A, suggesting that this protein may have a role in virulence. Here we show that TNFR1, a receptor for tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) that is widely distributed on the airway epithelium, is a receptor for protein A. We also show that the protein A-TNFR1 signaling pathway has a central role in the pathogenesis of staphylococcal pneumonia."
15861133,HPV31 E7 facilitates replication by activating E2F2 transcription through its interaction with HDACs.,"The E7 proteins of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) contribute to oncogenesis by associating with Rb family members as well class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). The binding of HDACs is also important for the maintenance of viral episomes during the differentiation-dependent productive life cycle. The effects of E7 and other viral proteins on E2F family members were examined in differentiating keratinocytes. E7 was found to specifically activate E2F2 transcription in suprabasal keratinocytes through its ability to bind HDACs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that, in differentiating cells, E7 acts to inhibit HDAC binding to the E2F2 promoter resulting in activation of expression. Reduction of E2F2 levels through the use of siRNA confirmed that E2F2 expression facilitated HPV replication but its loss did not affect cell proliferation. Our study demonstrates a mechanism by which binding of HDACs to E7 directly modulates viral replication and identifies E2F2 as a possible target for antiviral therapies."
10079180,Epithelin/granulin growth factors: extracellular cofactors for HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins.,"Epithelin/granulin growth factor is synthesized as a 593 amino acid precursor protein that contains 7.5 imperfectly conserved repeats of approximately 57 amino acids. Processed epithelin/granulin peptides have been isolated from vertebrate/invertebrate species and are growth factors implicated in epithelial and haemic cell function. Here they are identified as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Tat binding proteins using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Intracellularly in yeast, mutation of selected cysteines in an epithelin/granulin dimeric repeat caused loss of binding to Tat exon 1. In vitro binding of HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat to epithelin/granulin dimeric and monomeric repeats was also observed by GST-glutathione bead ""pulldown"" assays. Because Tat is actively secreted from HIV-infected cells and has been shown to serve as a mitogenic factor for angiogenesis and for Kaposi-like cells, our observations suggest that epithelin/granulin growth factors may function as biologically important extracellular Tat co-factors."
7884893,"Mode of action of SDZ NIM 811, a nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporin A analog with activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1: interference with HIV protein-cyclophilin A interactions.","Cyclosporins, in particular the nonimmunosuppressive derivative SDZ NIM 811, exhibit potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity in vitro. SDZ NIM 811 interferes at two stages of the viral replication cycle: (i) translocation of the preintegration complex to the nucleus and (ii) production of infectious virus particles. Immunosuppressive activity is not correlated with anti-HIV-1 activity of cyclosporins. However, binding to cyclophilin A, the major cellular receptor protein of cyclosporins, is a prerequisite for HIV inhibition: all structural changes of the cyclosporin A molecule leading to loss of affinity to cyclophilin abolished the antiviral effect. Cyclosporin derivatives did not interact directly with HIV-1 proteins; cyclophilin was the only detectable receptor protein for antivirally active cyclosporins. There is no evidence that inhibition of HIV occurs via a gain of function of cyclophilin in the presence of cyclosporins: the complex of cyclophilin A with SDZ NIM 811 does not bind to calcineurin or to any other viral or cellular proteins under conditions in which calcineurin binding to the cyclophilin A-cyclosporin A complex is easily detectable. Thus, the loss of function caused by binding of cyclosporins to cyclophilin seems to be sufficient for the anti-HIV effect. Cyclophilin A was demonstrated to bind to HIV-1 p24gag, and the formation of complexes was blocked by cyclosporins with 50% inhibitory concentrations of about 0.7 microM. HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus are only weakly or not at all inhibited by cyclosporins. For gag-encoded proteins derived from HIV-1, HIV-2, or simian immunodeficiency virus particles, cyclophilin-binding capacity correlated with sensitivity of the viruses to inhibition by cyclosporins. Cyclophilin A also binds to HIV-1 proteins other than gag-encoded proteins, namely, p17gag, Nef, Vif, and gp120env; the biological significance of these interactions is questionable. We conclude that HIV-1 Gag-cyclophilin A interaction may be essential in HIV-1 replication, and interference with this interaction may be the molecular basis for the antiviral activity of cyclosporins."
11842245,"Topors, a p53 and topoisomerase I binding protein, interacts with the adeno-associated virus (AAV-2) Rep78/68 proteins and enhances AAV-2 gene expression.","The adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) Rep proteins are essential for AAV DNA replication and regulation of AAV gene expression. We have identified a cellular protein interacting with Rep78 and Rep68 in yeast two-hybrid analysis and in GST pull-down assays. This protein has recently been described as both a p53 (p53BP3) and a topoisomerase I interacting protein (Topors). It contains an arginine/serine-rich domain, a RING finger domain and five PEST sequences. A minimal sequence sufficient for interaction with Rep was mapped to Topors amino acids 871 to 917. We show that the same region is also involved in the interaction with p53. Rep sequences involved in interaction with Topors were mapped to Rep amino acids 172 to 481. Overexpression of Topors stimulated AAV gene expression in the absence of helper virus, suggesting a function of Topors as a transcriptional regulator."
15351208,Characterization of a nuclear localization signal in the C-terminus of the adeno-associated virus Rep68/78 proteins.,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) replicates in the nucleus of infected cells, and therefore multiple nuclear import events are required for productive infection. We analyzed nuclear import of the viral Rep proteins and characterized a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus. We demonstrate that basic residues in this region constitute an NLS that is transferable and mediates interaction with the nuclear import receptor importin alpha in vitro. Mutant Rep proteins are predominantly cytoplasmic and are severely compromised for interactions with importin alpha, but retain their enzymatic functions in vitro. Interestingly, mutations of the NLS had significantly less effect on importin alpha interaction and replication in the context of Rep78 than when incorporated into the Rep68 protein. Together, our results demonstrate that a bipartite NLS exists in the shared part of Rep68 and Rep78, and suggest that an alternate entry mechanism may also contribute to nuclear localization of the Rep78 protein."
12667798,"Differential incorporation of uracil DNA glycosylase UNG2 into HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV(MAC) viral particles.","We have previously reported that the host uracil DNA glycosylase UNG2 enzyme is incorporated into HIV-1 virions via a specific association with the viral integrase (IN) domain of Gag-Pol precursor. In this study, we investigated whether UNG2 was packaged into two phylogenetically closely related primate lentiviruses, HIV-2(ROD) and SIV(MAC239). We demonstrated by GST-pull-down and coprecipitation assays that INs from HIV-1, HIV-2(ROD), and SIV(MAC239) associated with UNG2, although the interaction of UNG2 with HIV-2(ROD) IN and SIV(MAC239) IN was less strong than with HIV-1 IN. We then showed by Western blotting that highly purified HIV-2 and SIV(MAC) viral particles did not incorporate host UNG2, contrasting with the presence of UNG2 in HIV-1 viral particles. Finally, we showed that HIV-1/SIV chimeric viruses in which residues 6 to 202 of HIV-1 IN were replaced by the SIV counterpart were impaired for packaging of UNG2, indicating that the incorporation of host UNG2 into viral particles is the hallmark of the HIV-1 strain. Moreover, we found that HIV-1/SIV IN chimeric viruses were deficient for viral propagation."
10873631,Complex formation between hepatitis C virus core protein and p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1.,"The core protein (Core) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been known to play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis. By using glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay, we show here that Core formed a complex with p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 (p21) cell cycle regulator. The deletion-mapping analysis revealed that a portion near the N-terminus of Core (amino acids 24-52) and a C-terminal portion of p21 (amino acids 139-164) were involved in the complex formation. The complex formation was not impaired by point mutations of p21 at residues 147, 149, and 150, which have been reported to abrogate interaction of p21 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), discriminating the Core-binding sequence from the PCNA-binding sequence. Due to the close vicinity of the binding sites, however, Core and PCNA competed with each other when interacting with p21. The distinct interaction between Core and p21 may provide a new aspect to the studies of HCV pathogenesis."
15989969,Cyclophilin B is a functional regulator of hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase.,"Viruses depend on host-derived factors for their efficient genome replication. Here, we demonstrate that a cellular peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), cyclophilin B (CyPB), is critical for the efficient replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome. CyPB interacted with the HCV RNA polymerase NS5B to directly stimulate its RNA binding activity. Both the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated reduction of endogenous CyPB expression and the induced loss of NS5B binding to CyPB decreased the levels of HCV replication. Thus, CyPB functions as a stimulatory regulator of NS5B in HCV replication machinery. This regulation mechanism for viral replication identifies CyPB as a target for antiviral therapeutic strategies."
9032343,The hydrophobic pocket of cyclophilin is the binding site for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag polyprotein.,"Completion of an early step in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) life cycle requires incorporation into virions of the cellular peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (CyPA) by the Gag polyprotein. Elucidation of the biochemical role of CyPA would be aided by a detailed analysis of the genetic requirements for the formation of the Gag-CyPA complex; previous experiments have demonstrated the requirement for a critical proline and the immediately preceding glycine, located within the capsid domain of Gag, but nothing is known about the necessary CyPA residues. Cyclophilins possess a hydrophobic pocket where proline-containing peptide substrates and the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A bind. In this study, we engineered five CyPA mutations, each of which alters a residue that contributes to the hydrophobic pocket. Compared with the wild-type protein, all of the mutants drastically reduced CyPA binding to HIV-1 Gag and similarly inhibited CyPA incorporation into virions. In addition, we demonstrated that previously reported differences between the Gag-binding properties of CyPA and CyPB are due to adventitious association involving residues in the signal sequence of CyPB and that the core domain of CyPB interacts with Gag in a fashion which is indistinguishable from that of CyPA. These studies indicate that, as with other proline-containing peptides or cyclosporine A, HIV-1 Gag directly contacts residues in the hydrophobic pocket of CyPA."
12756246,The interaction between HIV-1 Gag and human lysyl-tRNA synthetase during viral assembly.,"Human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) is a tRNA-binding protein that is selectively packaged into HIV-1 along with its cognate tRNALys isoacceptors. Evidence exists that Gag alone is sufficient for the incorporation of LysRS into virions. Herein, using both in vitro and in vivo methods, we begin to map regions in Gag and LysRS that are required for this interaction. In vitro reactions between wild-type and truncated HIV-1 Gag and human LysRS were monitored using GST-tagged molecules and glutathione-agarose chromatography. Gag/LysRS interaction in vivo was detected in 293FT cells cotransfected with plasmids coding for wild-type or mutant HIV-1 Gag and LysRS, either by monitoring Gag.LysRS complexes immunoprecipitated from cell lysate with anti-LysRS or by measuring the ability of LysRS to be packaged into budded Gag viral-like particles. Based on these studies, we conclude that the Gag/LysRS interaction depends upon Gag sequences within the C-terminal domain of capsid (the last 54 amino acids) and amino acids 208-259 of LysRS. The latter domain includes the class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase consensus sequence known as motif 1. Both regions have been implicated in homodimerization of capsid and LysRS, respectively. Sequences falling outside these amino acid stretches can be deleted from either molecule without affecting the Gag/LysRS interaction, further supporting the observation that LysRS is incorporated into Gag viral-like particles independent of its ability to bind tRNALys."
17898068,Identification of an APOBEC3G binding site in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vif and inhibitors of Vif-APOBEC3G binding.,"The APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases are potent antiviral factors that restrict replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 Vif binds APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F and targets these proteins for ubiquitination by forming an E3 ubiquitin ligase with cullin 5 and elongins B and C. The N-terminal region of Vif is required for APOBEC3G binding, but the binding site(s) is unknown. To identify the APOBEC3G binding site in Vif, we established a scalable binding assay in a format compatible with development of high-throughput screens. In vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins identified Vif peptides and monoclonal antibodies that inhibit Vif-APOBEC3G binding and suggested involvement of Vif residues 33 to 83 in APOBEC3G binding. Cell-based binding assays confirmed these results and demonstrated that residues 40 to 71 in the N terminus of Vif contain a nonlinear binding site for APOBEC3G. Mutation of the highly conserved residues His42/43 but not other charged residues in this region inhibited Vif-APOBEC3G binding, Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3G, and viral infectivity. In contrast, mutation of these residues had no significant effect on Vif binding and degradation of APOBEC3F, suggesting a differential requirement for His42/43 in Vif binding to APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F. These results identify a nonlinear APOBEC3 binding site in the N terminus of Vif and demonstrate that peptides or antibodies directed against this region can inhibit Vif-APOBEC3G binding, validating the Vif-APOBEC3 interface as a potential drug target."
16636053,A zinc-binding region in Vif binds Cul5 and determines cullin selection.,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Vif overcomes the anti-viral activity of APOBEC3G by targeting it for ubiquitination via a Cullin 5-ElonginB-ElonginC (Cul5-EloBC) E3 ligase. Vif associates with Cul5-EloBC through a BC-box motif that binds EloC, but the mechanism by which Vif selectively recruits Cul5 is poorly understood. Here we report that a region of Vif (residues 100-142) upstream of the BC-box binds selectively to Cul5 in the absence of EloC. This region contains a zinc coordination site HX5CX17-18CX3-5H (HCCH), with His/Cys residues at positions 108, 114, 133, and 139 coordinating one zinc ion. The HCCH zinc coordination site, which is conserved among primate lentivirus Vif proteins, does not correspond to any known class of zinc-binding motif. Mutations of His/Cys residues in the HCCH motif impair zinc coordination, Cul5 binding, and APOBEC3G degradation. Mutations of conserved hydrophobic residues (Ile-120, Ala-123, and Leu-124) located between the two Cys residues in the HCCH motif disrupt binding of the zinc-coordinating region to Cul5 and inhibit APOBEC3G degradation. The Vif binding site maps to the first cullin repeat in the N terminus of Cul5. These data suggest that the zinc-binding region in Vif is a novel cullin interaction domain that mediates selective binding to Cul5. We propose that the HCCH zinc-binding motif facilitates Vif-Cul5 binding by playing a structural role in positioning hydrophobic residues for direct contact with Cul5."
19128510,MDM2 is a novel E3 ligase for HIV-1 Vif.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle by antagonizing a host restriction factor APOBEC3G (A3G). Vif interacts with A3G and induces its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the formation of active ubiquitin ligase (E3) complex with Cullin5-ElonginB/C. Although Vif itself is also ubiquitinated and degraded rapidly in infected cells, precise roles and mechanisms of Vif ubiquitination are largely unknown. Here we report that MDM2, known as an E3 ligase for p53, is a novel E3 ligase for Vif and induces polyubiquitination and degradation of Vif. We also show the mechanisms by which MDM2 only targets Vif, but not A3G that binds to Vif. MDM2 reduces cellular Vif levels and reversely increases A3G levels, because the interaction between MDM2 and Vif precludes A3G from binding to Vif. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MDM2 negatively regulates HIV-1 replication in non-permissive target cells through Vif degradation. These data suggest that MDM2 is a regulator of HIV-1 replication and might be a novel therapeutic target for anti-HIV-1 drug."
9841925,Establishment of a functional human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcription complex involves the cytoskeleton.,"After interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions with cell surface receptors, a series of poorly characterized events results in establishment of a viral reverse transcription complex in the host cell cytoplasm. This process is coordinated in such a way that reverse transcription is initiated shortly after formation of the viral reverse transcription complex. However, the mechanism through which virus entry and initiation of reverse transcription are coordinated and how these events are compartmentalized in the infected cell are not known. In this study, we demonstrate that viral reverse transcription complexes associate rapidly with the host cell cytoskeleton during HIV-1 infection and that reverse transcription occurs almost entirely in the cytoskeletal compartment. Interruption of actin polymerization before virus infection reduced association of viral reverse transcription complexes with the cytoskeleton. In addition, efficient reverse transcription was dependent on intact actin microfilaments. The localization of reverse transcription to actin microfilaments was mediated by the interaction of a reverse transcription complex component (gag MA) with actin but not vimentin (intermediate filaments) or tubulin (microtubules). In addition, fusion, but not endocytosis-mediated HIV-1 infectivity, was impaired when actin depolymerizing agents were added to target cells before infection but not when added after infection. These results point to a previously unsuspected role for the host cell cytoskeleton in HIV-1 entry and suggest that components of the cytoskeleton promote establishment of the reverse transcription complex in the host cell and also the process of reverse transcription within this complex."
11090181,A human nuclear shuttling protein that interacts with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 matrix is packaged into virions.,"Active nuclear import of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) preintegration complex (PIC) is essential for the productive infection of nondividing cells. Nuclear import of the PIC is mediated by the HIV-1 matrix protein, which also plays several critical roles during viral entry and possibly during virion production facilitating the export of Pr55(Gag) and genomic RNA. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a novel human virion-associated matrix-interacting protein (VAN) that is highly conserved in vertebrates and expressed in most human tissues. Its expression is upregulated upon activation of CD4(+) T cells. VAN is efficiently incorporated into HIV-1 virions and, like matrix, shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore, overexpression of VAN significantly inhibits HIV-1 replication in tissue culture. We propose that VAN regulates matrix nuclear localization and, by extension, both nuclear import of the PIC and export of Pr55(Gag) and viral genomic RNA during virion production. Our data suggest that this regulatory mechanism reflects a more global process for regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport."
18305167,ISG15 inhibits Ebola VP40 VLP budding in an L-domain-dependent manner by blocking Nedd4 ligase activity.,"Ebola virus budding is mediated by the VP40 matrix protein. VP40 can bud from mammalian cells independent of other viral proteins, and efficient release of VP40 virus-like particles (VLPs) requires interactions with host proteins such as tsg101 and Nedd4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitin itself is thought to be exploited by Ebola virus to facilitate efficient virus egress. Disruption of VP40 function and thus virus budding remains an attractive target for the development of novel antiviral therapies. Here, we investigate the effect of ISG15 protein on the release of Ebola VP40 VLPs. ISG15 is an IFN-inducible, ubiquitin-like protein expressed after bacterial or viral infection. Our results show that expression of free ISG15, or the ISGylation system (UbE1L and UbcH8), inhibits budding of Ebola virus VP40 VLPs. Addressing the molecular mechanism of this inhibition, we show that ISG15 interacts with Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase and inhibits ubiquitination of VP40. Furthermore, the L-domain deletion mutant of VP40 (DeltaPT/PY), which does not interact with Nedd4, was insensitive to ISG15-mediated inhibition of VLP release. These data provide evidence of antiviral activity of ISG15 against Ebola virus and suggest a mechanism of action involving disruption of Nedd4 function and subsequent ubiquitination of VP40."
19454348,Influenza A virus NS1 targets the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 to evade recognition by the host viral RNA sensor RIG-I.,"The ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 mediates Lysine 63-linked ubiquitination of the N-terminal CARD domains of the viral RNA sensor RIG-I to facilitate type I interferon (IFN) production and antiviral immunity. Here, we report that the influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) specifically inhibits TRIM25-mediated RIG-I CARD ubiquitination, thereby suppressing RIG-I signal transduction. A novel domain in NS1 comprising E96/E97 residues mediates its interaction with the coiled-coil domain of TRIM25, thus blocking TRIM25 multimerization and RIG-I CARD domain ubiquitination. Furthermore, a recombinant influenza A virus expressing an E96A/E97A NS1 mutant is defective in blocking TRIM25-mediated antiviral IFN response and loses virulence in mice. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which influenza virus inhibits host IFN response and also emphasize the vital role of TRIM25 in modulating antiviral defenses."
18391203,"EBV-encoded EBNA-6 binds and targets MRS18-2 to the nucleus, resulting in the disruption of pRb-E2F1 complexes.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), like other DNA tumor viruses, induces an S-phase in the natural host cell, the human B lymphocyte. This is linked with blast transformation. It is believed that the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA-6) is involved in the regulation of cell cycle entry. However, the possible mechanism of this regulation is not approached. In our current study, we found that EBNA-6 binds to a MRPS18-2 protein, and targets it to the nucleus. We found that MRPS18-2 binds to both hypo- and hyperphosphorylated forms of Rb protein specifically. This binding targets the small pocket of pRb, which is a site of interaction with E2F1. The MRPS18-2 competes with the binding of E2F1 to pRb, thereby raising the level of free E2F1. Our experimental data suggest that EBNA-6 may play a major role in the entry of EBV infected B cells into the S phase by binding to and raising the level of nuclear MRPS18-2, protein. This would inhibit pRb binding to E2F1 competitively and lift the block preventing S-phase entry."
16301520,Hepatitis C virus protease NS3/4A cleaves mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein off the mitochondria to evade innate immunity.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global epidemic manifested mainly by chronic infection. One strategy that HCV employs to establish chronic infection is to use the viral Ser protease NS3/4A to cleave some unknown cellular targets involved in innate immunity. Here we show that the target of NS3/4A is the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, MAVS, that activates NF-kappaB and IFN regulatory factor 3 to induce type-I interferons. NS3/4A cleaves MAVS at Cys-508, resulting in the dislocation of the N-terminal fragment of MAVS from the mitochondria. Remarkably, a point mutation of MAVS at Cys-508 renders MAVS resistant to cleavage by NS3/4A, thus maintaining the ability of MAVS to induce interferons in HCV replicon cells. NS3/4A binds to and colocalizes with MAVS in the mitochondrial membrane, and it can cleave MAVS directly in vitro. These results provide an example of host-pathogen interaction in which the virus evades innate immunity by dislodging a pivotal antiviral protein from the mitochondria and suggest that blocking the cleavage of MAVS by NS3/4A may be applied to the prevention and treatment of HCV."
9608663,The rubella virus putative replicase interacts with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein.,"In utero fetal infection of rubella virus (RV), a positive-stranded RNA virus, frequently induces birth defects if contracted in the first trimester of pregnancy. The underlying mechanism of RV-induced birth defects is not known. Birth defects are also common in certain DNA viral infections such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). During HCMV infection, one of its proteins interacts with a cell growth regulatory protein, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and stimulates DNA synthesis which is associated with chromosomal damage and cellular mitotic arrest. These affects have been implicated in HCMV induced teratogenesis. Since RV and HCMV both cause teratogenesis, we postulated that during RV infection, a virus-encoded protein might interact with Rb and affect fetal cell growth. In the present study, we have identified a known Rb-binding motif, L x C x E (LPCAE) in the carboxy-terminal half of the putative replicase (NSP90) of RV and demonstrated that the C-terminal region specifically binds to GST-Rb in vitro. Further, by coimmunoprecipitating NSP90 and Rb using specific antibodies to respective proteins, we have confirmed that NSP90 specifically binds to Rb in vivo as well. In addition, RV replication was shown to be less in null-mutant (Rb-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells than in wild-type (Rb+/+) cells, suggesting a possible physiological role for this interaction. Thus, in facilitating RV replication, binding of NSP90 to Rb potentially alters the cell growth regulatory property of Rb, and this could be one of the initial steps in RV-induced teratogenesis."
18511559,Next generation of adeno-associated virus 2 vectors: point mutations in tyrosines lead to high-efficiency transduction at lower doses.,"Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) vectors are in use in several Phase I/II clinical trials, but relatively large vector doses are needed to achieve therapeutic benefits. Large vector doses also trigger an immune response as a significant fraction of the vectors fails to traffic efficiently to the nucleus and is targeted for degradation by the host cell proteasome machinery. We have reported that epidermal growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase (EGFR-PTK) signaling negatively affects transduction by AAV2 vectors by impairing nuclear transport of the vectors. We have also observed that EGFR-PTK can phosphorylate AAV2 capsids at tyrosine residues. Tyrosine-phosphorylated AAV2 vectors enter cells efficiently but fail to transduce effectively, in part because of ubiquitination of AAV capsids followed by proteasome-mediated degradation. We reasoned that mutations of the surface-exposed tyrosine residues might allow the vectors to evade phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and, thus, prevent proteasome-mediated degradation. Here, we document that site-directed mutagenesis of surface-exposed tyrosine residues leads to production of vectors that transduce HeLa cells approximately 10-fold more efficiently in vitro and murine hepatocytes nearly 30-fold more efficiently in vivo at a log lower vector dose. Therapeutic levels of human Factor IX (F.IX) are also produced at an approximately 10-fold reduced vector dose. The increased transduction efficiency of tyrosine-mutant vectors is due to lack of capsid ubiquitination and improved intracellular trafficking to the nucleus. These studies have led to the development of AAV vectors that are capable of high-efficiency transduction at lower doses, which has important implications in their use in human gene therapy."
17875722,Efficient p53 activation and apoptosis by simultaneous disruption of binding to MDM2 and MDMX.,"The p53 tumor suppressor plays a key role in protection against malignant transformation. MDM2 and MDMX are important regulators of the transcriptional activity and stability of p53 by binding to its NH(2) terminus. Recent studies suggest that inhibition of both MDM2 and MDMX is necessary for robust activation of p53 in certain tumor cells. However, small-molecule MDM2 inhibitors such as Nutlin fail to inhibit MDMX despite significant homology between the two proteins. The therapeutic efficacy of such compounds may be compromised by MDMX overexpression. To evaluate the feasibility and biological effects of simultaneously disrupting p53 binding to MDM2 and MDMX, we used phage display to identify a novel peptide that can inhibit p53 interactions with MDM2 (IC(50) = 10 nmol/L) and MDMX (IC(50) = 100 nmol/L). Expression of a scaffold protein (thioredoxin) displaying this peptide sequence by adenovirus disrupts both MDM2 and MDMX interaction with p53, resulting in efficient p53 activation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of tumor cells overexpressing MDM2 and MDMX. Intratumoral injection of the adenovirus also induces growth suppression of tumor xenografts in mice in a p53-dependent fashion. These results show the therapeutic potential of targeting both MDM2 and MDMX in cancer, and provide a novel structural motif for the design of potent p53 activators."
21270162,The measles virus V protein binds to p65 (RelA) to suppress NF-kappaB activity.,"Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors are involved in controlling numerous cellular processes, including inflammation, innate and adaptive immunity, and cell survival. Here we show that the immunosuppressive measles virus (MV; Morbillivirus genus, Paramyxoviridae) has evolved multiple functions to interfere with canonical NF-κB signaling in epithelial cells. The MV P, V, and C proteins, also involved in preventing host cell interferon responses, were found to individually suppress NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression in response to activation of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, RIG-I-like receptors, or Toll-like receptors. NF-κB activity was most efficiently suppressed in the presence of V, while expression of P or C resulted in moderate inhibition. As indicated by reporter gene assays involving overexpression of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which phosphorylates the inhibitor of κB to liberate NF-κB, V protein targets a downstream step in the signaling cascade. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that V specifically binds to the Rel homology domain of the NF-κB subunit p65 but not of p50. Notably, the short C-terminal domain of the V protein, which is also involved in binding STAT2, IRF7, and MDA5, was sufficient for the interaction and for preventing reporter gene activity. As observed by confocal microscopy, the presence of V abolished nuclear translocation of p65 upon TNF-α stimulation. Thus, MV V appears to prevent NF-κB-dependent gene expression by retaining p65 in the cytoplasm. These findings reveal NF-κB as a key target of MV and stress the importance of the V protein as the major viral immune-modulatory factor."
21334391,The hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) targets and suppresses activation of the toll-like receptor signaling pathway.,"Viruses target innate immune pathways to evade host antiviral responses. Recent studies demonstrate a relationship between hepatitis B disease states and the host's innate immune response, although the mechanism of immunomodulation is unknown. In humans, the innate immune system recognizes pathogens via pattern recognition receptors such as the Toll-like receptors (TLR), initiating anti-inflammatory responses. TLR expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine production is reduced in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients following TLR stimulation. The aim of this study was to investigate interactions between TLR signaling pathways and the mature HBeAg protein localized in the cytosol."
21092281,"HTLV-I p30 inhibits multiple S phase entry checkpoints, decreases cyclin E-CDK2 interactions and delays cell cycle progression.",Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) has efficiently adapted to its host and establishes a persistent infection characterized by low levels of viral gene expression and slow proliferation of HTLV-I infected cells over decades. We have previously found that HTLV-I p30 is a negative regulator of virus expression.
19193793,Human respiratory syncytial virus nonstructural protein NS2 antagonizes the activation of beta interferon transcription by interacting with RIG-I.,"A wide variety of RNA viruses have been shown to produce proteins that inhibit interferon (IFN) production and signaling. For human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the nonstructural NS1 and NS2 proteins have been shown to block IFN signaling by causing the proteasomal degradation of STAT2. In addition, recombinant RSVs lacking either NS1 or NS2 induce more IFN production than wild-type (wt) RSV in infected cells. However, the mechanisms by which the NS proteins perform this function are unknown. In this study, we focused on defining the mechanism by which NS2 inhibits the induction of IFN transcription. We find that NS2 is required for the early inhibition of IFN transcription since the infection of cells with NS2-deletion RSV resulted in a higher level of IRF3 activation at early time points postinfection compared with that of wt or NS1-deletion RSV infection. In addition, NS2 expression inhibits IFN transcription induced by both the RIG-I and TLR3 pathways. Furthermore, we show that NS2 inhibits RIG-I-mediated IFN promoter activation by binding to the N-terminal CARD of RIG-I and inhibiting its interaction with the downstream component MAVS (IPS-1, VISA, Cardif). Thus, the RSV NS2 protein is a multifunctional IFN antagonist that targets specific components of both the IFN induction and IFN signaling pathways."
15841462,Interaction between the HCV NS3 protein and the host TBK1 protein leads to inhibition of cellular antiviral responses.,"The persistent nature of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection suggests that HCV encodes proteins that enable it to overcome host antiviral responses. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated signaling, which recognizes the double-stranded RNA that is produced during viral replication and induces type I interferons, including interferon beta (IFN-beta), is crucial to the host defense against viruses. Recent studies suggest that a TIR domain-containing adaptor protein, TRIF, and two protein kinases, TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and IkappaB kinase-epsilon (IKKepsilon), play essential roles in TLR3-mediated IFN-beta production through the activation of the transcriptional factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). We report that the HCV NS3 protein interacts directly with TBK1, and that this binding results in the inhibition of the association between TBK1 and IRF-3, which leads to the inhibition of IRF-3 activation. In conclusion, these results suggest the mechanisms of the inhibition of the innate immune responses of HCV infection by NS3 protein."
8606778,Genetic selection of peptide aptamers that recognize and inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase 2.,"A network of interacting proteins controls the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) (refs 1,2) and governs the entry of higher eukaryotic cells into S phase. Analysis of this and other genetic regulatory networks would be facilitated by intracellular reagents that recognize specific targets and inhibit specific network connections. We report here the expression of a combinatorial library of constrained 20-residue peptides displayed by the active-site loop of Escherichia coli thioredoxin, and the use of a two-hybrid system to select those that bind human Cdk2. These peptide aptamers were designed to mimic the recognition function of the complementarity-determining regions of immunoglobulins. The aptamers recognized different epitopes on the Cdk2 surface with equilibrium dissociation constant in the nanomolar range; those tested inhibited Cdk2 activity. Our results show that peptide aptamers bear some analogies with monoclonal antibodies, with the advantages that they are isolated together with their coding genes, that their small size should allow their structures to be solved, and that they are designated to function inside cells."
9755181,Rotavirus RNA-binding protein NSP3 interacts with eIF4GI and evicts the poly(A) binding protein from eIF4F.,"Most eukaryotic mRNAs contain a 5'cap structure and a 3'poly(A) sequence that synergistically increase the efficiency of translation. Rotavirus mRNAs are capped, but lack poly(A) sequences. During rotavirus infection, the viral protein NSP3A is bound to the viral mRNAs 3' end. We looked for cellular proteins that could interact with NSP3A, using the two-hybrid system in yeast. Screening a CV1 cell cDNA library allowed us to isolate a partial cDNA of the human eukaryotic initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI). The interaction of NSP3A with eIF4GI was confirmed in rotavirus infected cells by co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro with NSP3A produced in Escherichia coli. In addition, we show that the amount of poly(A) binding protein (PABP) present in eIF4F complexes decreases during rotavirus infection, even though eIF4A and eIF4E remain unaffected. PABP is removed from the eIF4F complex after incubation in vitro with the C-terminal part of NSP3A, but not with its N-terminal part produced in E.coli. These results show that a physical link between the 5' and the 3' ends of mRNA is necessary for the efficient translation of viral mRNAs and strongly support the closed loop model for the initiation of translation. These results also suggest that NSP3A, by taking the place of PABP on eIF4GI, is responsible for the shut-off of cellular protein synthesis."
12368356,Implication of the lymphocyte-specific nuclear body protein Sp140 in an innate response to human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"The viral infectivity factor (Vif) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) neutralizes an unidentified antiviral pathway that occurs only in nonpermissive (NP) cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human lymphocyte cDNA library, we identified several potential Vif partners. One, the nuclear body protein Sp140, was found specifically in all NP cells (n = 12 cell lines tested; P < or = 0.001), and HIV-1 infection induced its partial dispersal from nuclear bodies into cytosolic colocalization with Vif. Our results implicate Sp140 in a response to HIV-1 that may be related to or coordinated with the pathway that inactivates HIV-1 lacking vif."
9445076,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 matrix protein interacts with cellular protein HO3.,"The matrix (MA) protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) plays a critical role in virion morphogenesis and fulfills important functions during the early steps of infection. In an effort to identify cellular partners of MA, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid screen was utilized. A specific interaction between MA and HO3, a putative histidyl-tRNA synthetase, was demonstrated in this system. HO3-specific mRNA was detected in several tissues relevant for HIV infection, such as spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood lymphocytes, as well as in a number of T-lymphoid-cell lines. The binding of MA to HO3 was confirmed in transfected cells by coimmunoprecipitation. This interaction was abrogated by replacing two lysine residues at positions 26 and 27 of MA by threonine (MA(KK27TT)). HO3 localized both to the cytoplasm and to the nucleus of acutely transfected 293T cells. When overexpressed in HIV-1-producing cells, HO3 was incorporated into wild-type virions but not in ones containing the dilysine-mutated variant of MA. Correspondingly, overexpression of HO3 in virus producer cells enhanced the infectivity of wild-type but not MA(KK27AA) HIV-1 particles. The stimulating effect of HO3 was independent from the presence of Envelope, Vpr, or Vpu. Taken together, these results suggest that HO3, through its recognition of MA, plays a role in the life cycle of HIV-1."
15775987,Adenoviral proteins mimic nutrient/growth signals to activate the mTOR pathway for viral replication.,"Like tumor cells, DNA viruses have had to evolve mechanisms that uncouple cellular replication from the many intra- and extracellular factors that normally control it. Here we show that adenovirus encodes two proteins that activate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) for viral replication, even under nutrient/growth factor-limiting conditions. E4-ORF1 mimics growth factor signaling by activating PI3-kinase, resulting in increased Rheb.GTP loading and mTOR activation. E4-ORF4 is redundant with glucose in stimulating mTOR, does not affect Rheb.GTP levels and is the major mechanism whereby adenovirus activates mTOR in quiescent primary cells. We demonstrate that mTOR is activated through a mechanism that is dependent on the E4-ORF4 protein phosphatase 2A-binding domain. We also show that mTOR activation is required for efficient S-phase entry, independently of E2F activation, in adenovirus-infected quiescent primary cells. These data reveal that adenovirus has evolved proteins that activate the mTOR pathway, irrespective of the cellular microenvironment, and which play a requisite role in viral replication."
10523854,Modulation of the NF-kappa B pathway by virally encoded death effector domains-containing proteins.,"Death Effector Domains (DEDs) have been known to mediate the recruitment of Caspase 8 and its homologs to the aggregated death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), consisting of the death domain (DD)-containing receptors and various signaling proteins. In addition, several viruses were recently shown to encode proteins with DEDs (also called FLICE inhibitory proteins or vFLIPs) which have the ability of blocking cell death induced by DD-containing receptors. We provide evidence that vFLIPs can also modulate the NF-kappaB pathway and physically interact with several signaling proteins, such as the TRAFs, RIP, NIK and the IKKs. Modulation of the NF-kappaB pathway may play a role in the natural history of infection by these viruses."
12080047,The adenosine 2b receptor is recruited to the plasma membrane and associates with E3KARP and Ezrin upon agonist stimulation.,"We have previously shown that adenosine is formed in the intestinal lumen during active inflammation from neutrophil-derived 5'-AMP. Acting through the adenosine A2b receptor (A2bR), the luminally derived adenosine induces vectorial chloride secretion and a polarized secretion of interleukin-6 to the intestinal lumen. Although some G protein-coupled receptors interact with anchoring or signaling molecules, not much is known in this critical area for the A2bR. We used the model intestinal epithelial cell line, T84, and Caco2-BBE cells stably transfected with GFP-A2b receptor to study the intestinal A2bR. The A2bR is present in both the apical and basolateral membranes of intestinal epithelia. Apical or basolateral stimulation of the A2bR induces recruitment of the receptor to the plasma membrane and caveolar fractions. The A2bR co-immunoprecipitates with E3KARP and ezrin upon agonist stimulation. Ezrin interacts with E3KARP and PKA and the interaction between ezrin and E3KARP is enhanced by agonist stimulation. Our data suggest that the A2bR is recruited to the plasma membrane upon apical or basolateral agonist stimulation and interacts with E3KARP and ezrin. We speculate that such an interaction may not only anchor the A2bR to the plasma membrane but may also function to stabilize the receptor in a signaling complex in the plasma membrane."
2463167,Peptide antibodies to the human c-fyn gene product demonstrate pp59c-fyn is capable of complex formation with the middle-T antigen of polyomavirus.,"The c-fyn proto-oncogene is a member of a family of closely related genes of which c-src is the prototype. Using peptide antibodies which had been raised against sequences predicted to be specific for the human c-fyn gene product, the c-fyn protein was identified. It is a tyrosine kinase with apparent mol. wt of 59 kd that is also phosphorylated and myristylated. Like pp60c-src and pp62c-yes, pp59c-fyn is able to form a stable complex with middle-T antigen, the transforming protein of polyomavirus. The transformation-defective middle-T mutant NG59, which is unable to associate stably with pp60c-src does not associate with pp59c-fyn. In contrast to pp60c-src, complex formation with middle-T antigen does not lead to a significant increase in the tyrosine kinase activity of pp59c-fyn. These findings lead us to suggest that middle-T mediated transformation may be a consequence of the deregulation of several members of the src-family of protein tyrosine kinases."
1985196,"Structural elements that regulate pp59c-fyn catalytic activity, transforming potential, and ability to associate with polyomavirus middle-T antigen.","Except for its unique amino-terminal region (residues 1 through 83), which possibly dictates substrate recognition, pp59c-fyn bears a high degree of homology with other members of the src family of tyrosine kinases. Here we show that the carboxy terminus of pp59c-fyn is necessary for stable middle-T-antigen association, that pp59c-fyn is normally phosphorylated on both serine and tyrosine residues, and that Tyr-531 and Tyr-420 are phosphorylation sites in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Analysis of a spontaneously generated mutant encoding a truncated form of pp59c-fyn and of variants specifically mutated at the Tyr-531 and Tyr-420 phosphorylation sites indicates that pp59c-fyn has regulatory elements analogous to those that have already been identified for other src-like tyrosine kinases. However, further examination of the pp59c-fyn variants suggests the likelihood of additional means by which its activities might be regulated. Although alteration of Tyr-531 to phenylalanine (531F) in pp59c-fyn results in a protein which is more active enzymatically that the wild type, the enhancement is much less than that for the analogous variant of pp60c-src. Furthermore, contrary to results of similar experiments on other src-like proto-oncogene products, 531F did not induce transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Studies involving pp59c-fyn-pp60c-src chimeras in which the unique amino-terminal sequences (residues 1 through 83) of the two kinases were precisely interchanged implied that the inability of 531F to induce transformation is probably not caused by the absence of substrates for pp59c-fyn in NIH 3T3 cells but rather by the insufficient enhancement of pp59c-fyn kinase activity. It is therefore probable that the kinase and transforming activities of pp59c-fyn are repressed by additional regulatory elements possibly located in the amino-terminal half of the molecule."
15159405,The interaction between HIV-1 Gag and APOBEC3G.,"APOBEC3G, a member of an RNA/DNA cytidine deaminase superfamily, has been identified as a cellular inhibitor of HIV-1 infectivity, possibly through the dC to dU deamination of the first minus strand cDNA synthesized during reverse transcription. Virions incorporate APOBEC3G during viral assembly in non-permissive cells, and this incorporation is inhibited by the viral protein Vif. The mechanism of APOBEC3G incorporation into HIV-1 is examined in this report. In the absence of Vif, cytoplasmic APOBEC3G becomes membrane-bound in cells expressing HIV-1 Gag, and its incorporation into Gag viral-like particles (VLPs) is proportional to the amount of APOBEC3G expressed in the cell. The expression of Vif, or mutant Gag unable to bind to membrane, prevents the APOBEC3G association with membrane. HIV-1 Gag alone among viral proteins is sufficient for packaging of APOBEC3G into Gag VLPs, and this incorporation requires the presence of Gag nucleocapsid. The presence of amino acids 104-156 in APOBEC3G, located in the linker region between two zinc coordination motifs, is also required for its incorporation into Gag VLPs. Evidence against an RNA bridge facilitating the Gag/APOBEC3G interaction includes data indicating that 1) the incorporation of APOBEC3G occurs independently of viral genomic RNA, 2) a Gag/APOBEC3G complex is immunoprecipitated from cell lysate after RNase treatment, and 3) the zinc coordination motif, rather than the regions flanking this motif, have been implicated in RNA binding in another family member, APOBEC1."
14564014,Induction of APOBEC3G ubiquitination and degradation by an HIV-1 Vif-Cul5-SCF complex.,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Vif is essential for viral evasion of host antiviral factor CEM15/APOBEC3G. We report that Vif interacts with cellular proteins Cul5, elongins B and C, and Rbx1 to form an Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF)-like complex. The ability of Vif to suppress antiviral activity of APOBEC3G was specifically dependent on Cul5-SCF function, allowing Vif to interact with APOBEC3G and induce its ubiquitination and degradation. A Vif mutant that interacted with APOBEC3G but not with Cul5-SCF was functionally inactive. The Cul5-SCF was also required for Vif function in distantly related simian immunodeficiency virus mac. These results indicate that the conserved Cul5-SCF pathway used by Vif is a potential target for antiviral development."
15543155,Human CD59 is a receptor for the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin intermedilysin.,"Cholesterol is believed to serve as the common receptor for the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs). One member of this toxin family, Streptococcus intermedius intermedilysin (ILY), exhibits a narrow spectrum of cellular specificity that is seemingly inconsistent with this premise. We show here that ILY, via its domain 4 structure, binds to the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein human CD59 (huCD59). CD59 is an inhibitor of the membrane attack complex of human complement. ILY specifically binds to huCD59 via residues that are the binding site for the C8alpha and C9 complement proteins. These studies provide a new model for the mechanism of cellular recognition by a CDC."
9792705,Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylates and regulates the HIV-1 Vif protein.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif protein plays a critical role in virus replication and infectivity. Here we show that Vif is phosphorylated and regulated by p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Vif phosphorylation by MAPK was demonstrated in vitro as well as in vivo and was shown to occur on serine and threonine residues. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping indicated that Vif is phosphorylated by MAPK on the same sites in vitro and in vivo. Radioactive peptide sequencing identified two phosphorylation sites, Thr96 and Ser165. These phosphorylation sites do not correspond to the known optimum consensus sequences for phosphorylation by MAPK (PX(S/T)P) nor to the minimum consensus sequence ((S/T)P), indicating that MAPK can phosphorylate proteins at sites other than those containing the PX(S/T)P or (S/T)P motifs. Synthetic Vif peptides corresponding to the local sequences of the phosphorylation sites were not phosphorylated by MAPK, suggesting that recognition of these sites by MAPK is likely to require structural determinants outside the phosphorylation site. Mutations of the Thr96 site, which is conserved among Vif sequences from HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV, resulted in significant loss of Vif activity and inhibition of HIV-1 replication. These results suggest that MAPK plays a direct role in regulating HIV-1 replication and infectivity by phosphorylating Vif and identify a novel mechanism for activation of HIV-1 replication by mitogens and other extracellular stimuli."
10074203,Regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infectivity by the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.,"ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) play a critical role in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in response to mitogens and other extracellular stimuli. Mitogens and cytokines that activate MAPK in T cells have been shown to activate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Little is known about the signal transduction pathways that activate HIV-1 replication in T cells upon activation by extracellular stimulation. Here, we report that activation of MAPK through the Ras/Raf/MEK signaling pathway enhances the infectivity of HIV-1 virions. Virus infectivity was enhanced by treatment of cells with MAPK stimulators, such as serum and phorbol myristate acetate, as well as by coexpression of constitutively activated Ras, Raf, or MEK (MAPK kinase) in the absence of extracellular stimulation. Treatment of cells with PD 098059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK activation, or with a MAPK antisense oligonucleotide reduced the infectivity of HIV-1 virions without significantly affecting virus production or the levels of virion-associated Gag and Env proteins. MAPK has been shown to regulate HIV-1 infectivity by phosphorylating Vif (X. Yang and D. Gabuzda, J. Biol. Chem. 273:29879-29887, 1998). However, MAPK activation enhanced virus infectivity in some cells lines that do not require Vif function. The HIV-1 Rev, Tat, p17(Gag), and Nef proteins were directly phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro, suggesting that other HIV-1 proteins are potential substrates for MAPK phosphorylation. These results suggest that activation of the ERK MAPK pathway plays a role in HIV-1 replication by enhancing the infectivity of HIV-1 virions through Vif-dependent as well as Vif-independent mechanisms. MAPK activation in producer cells may contribute to the activation of HIV-1 replication when T cells are activated by mitogens and other extracellular stimuli."
16086019,Immune evasion by a staphylococcal complement inhibitor that acts on C3 convertases.,"The complement system is pivotal in host defense but also contributes to tissue injury in several diseases. The assembly of C3 convertases (C4b2a and C3bBb) is a prerequisite for complement activation. The convertases catalyze C3b deposition on activator surfaces. Here we describe the identification of staphylococcal complement inhibitor, an excreted 9.8-kilodalton protein that blocks human complement by specific interaction with C4b2a and C3bBb. Staphylococcal complement inhibitor bound and stabilized C3 convertases, interfering with additional C3b deposition through the classical, lectin and alternative complement pathways. This led to a substantial decrease in phagocytosis and killing of Staphylococcus aureus by human neutrophils. As a highly active and small soluble protein that acts exclusively on surfaces, staphylococcal complement inhibitor may represent a promising anti-inflammatory molecule."
8552640,Phosphorylation-dependent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and nuclear targeting of viral DNA.,"In the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), gag MA (matrix), a major structural protein of the virus, carries out opposing targeting functions. During virus assembly, gag MA is cotranslationally myristoylated, a modification required for membrane targeting of gag polyproteins. During virus infection, however, gag MA, by virtue of a nuclear targeting signal at its N terminus, facilitates the nuclear localization of viral DNA and establishment of the provirus. We now show that phosphorylation of gag MA on tyrosine and serine prior to and during virus infection facilitates its dissociation from the membrane, thus allowing it to translocate to the nucleus. Inhibition of gag MA phosphorylation either on tyrosine or on serine prevents gag MA-mediated nuclear targeting of viral nucleic acids and impairs virus infectivity. The requirement for gag MA phosphorylation in virus infection is underscored by our finding that a serine/threonine kinase is associated with virions of HIV-1. These results reveal a novel level of regulation of primate lentivirus infectivity."
18066077,"Crystal structure of SopA, a Salmonella effector protein mimicking a eukaryotic ubiquitin ligase.","Bacterial pathogens deliver virulence proteins into host cells to facilitate entry and survival. Salmonella SopA functions as an E3 ligase to manipulate the host proinflammatory response. Here we report the crystal structure of SopA in two conformations. Although it has little sequence similarity to eukaryotic HECT-domain E3s, the C-terminal half of SopA has a bilobal architecture that is reminiscent of the N- and C-lobe arrangement of HECT domains. The SopA structure also contains a putative substrate-binding domain located near the E2-binding site. The two structures of SopA differ in the relative orientations of the C lobe, indicating that SopA possesses the conformational flexibility essential for HECT E3 function. These results suggest that SopA is a unique HECT E3 ligase evolved from the coevolutionary selective pressure at the bacterium-host interface."
11703931,KDEL-cargo regulates interactions between proteins involved in COPI vesicle traffic: measurements in living cells using FRET.,"How the occupied KDEL receptor ERD2 is sorted into COPI vesicles for Golgi-to-ER transport is largely unknown. Here, interactions between proteins of the COPI transport machinery occurring during a ""wave"" of transport of a KDEL ligand were studied in living cells. FRET between CFP and YFP fusion proteins was measured by multifocal multiphoton microscopy and bulk-cell spectrofluorimetry. Ligand binding induces oligomerization of ERD2 and recruitment of ARFGAP to the Golgi, where the (ERD2)n/ARFGAP complex interacts with membrane-bound ARF1. During KDEL ligand transport, interactions of ERD2 with beta-COP and p23 decrease and the proteins segregate. Both p24a and p23 interact with ARF1, but only p24 interacts with ARFGAP. These findings suggest a model for how cargo-induced oligomerization of ERD2 regulates its sorting into COPI-coated buds."
16101678,HIV-1 Gag-RNA interaction occurs at a perinuclear/centrosomal site; analysis by confocal microscopy and FRET.,"The Gag polyprotein is the major structural protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) constituting the viral core. Between translation on cytoplasmic polysomes and assembly into viral particles at the plasma membrane, it specifically captures the RNA genome of the virus through binding RNA structural motifs (packaging signals -Psi) in the RNA. RNA is believed to be a structural facilitator of Gag assembly. Using a combined approach of immunofluorescence detection of Gag protein and in situ hybridisation detection of viral genomic RNA, we demonstrate that Gag protein colocalises early after expression with Psi+ RNA in the perinuclear region and also colocalises with centrioles. Colocalised RNA and protein subsequently traffic through the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane of the cell. Gag expressed from Psi- RNA diffuses throughout the cell. It is not found at centrioles and shows delayed cytoplasmic colocalisation with the RNA genome. RNA capture through Psi does not influence binding of Gag to microfilaments. Gag does not bind to tubulin during export. The presence of the packaging signal may coordinate capture of Psi+ RNA by Gag protein at the centrosome followed by their combined transport to the site of budding. HIV-1 Psi thus acts as a subcellular localisation signal as well as a high-affinity-binding site for Gag."
18787122,The Salmonella virulence protein SifA is a G protein antagonist.,"Salmonella's success at proliferating intracellularly and causing disease depends on the translocation of a major virulence protein, SifA, into the host cell. SifA recruits membranes enriched in lysosome associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and is needed for growth of Salmonella induced filaments (Sifs) and the Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV). It directly binds a host protein called SKIP (SifA and kinesin interacting protein) which is critical for membrane stability and motor dynamics at the SCV. SifA also contains a WxxxE motif, predictive of G protein mimicry in bacterial effectors, but whether and how it mimics the action of a host G protein is not known. We show that SKIP's pleckstrin homology domain, which directly binds SifA, also binds to the late endosomal GTPase Rab9. Knockdown studies suggest that both SKIP and Rab9 function to maintain peripheral LAMP1 distribution in cells. The Rab9:SKIP interaction is GTP-dependent and is inhibited by SifA binding to the SKIP pleckstrin homology domain, suggesting that SifA may be a Rab9 antagonist. SifA:SKIP binding is significantly tighter than Rab9:SKIP binding and may thus allow SifA to bring SKIP to the SCV via SKIP's Rab9-binding site. Rab9 can measurably reverse SifA-dependent LAMP1 recruitment and the perinuclear location of the SCV in cells. Importantly, binding to SKIP requires SifA residues W197 and E201 of the conserved WxxxE signature sequence, leading to the speculation that bacterial G protein mimicry may result in G protein antagonism."
19850040,Nucleolar disruption impairs Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ORF57-mediated nuclear export of intronless viral mRNAs.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF57 plays a pivotal role in mediating the nuclear export of KSHV intronless transcripts. We demonstrate that ORF57 localises and dynamically trafficks through the nucleolus. To assess if nucleolar shuttling of ORF57 is important for the export of intronless viral mRNA, the ability of ORF57 to export mRNA was assessed in cells where the nucleolus was disrupted using Actinomycin D or DRB. We show that rapid disorganisation of the nucleolus was accompanied by a reduction in intronless virus mRNA export, suggesting that an intact nucleolus is essential for efficient KSHV ORF57-mediated intronless mRNA export."
12663789,"Complexes of poliovirus serotypes with their common cellular receptor, CD155.","Structures of all three poliovirus (PV) serotypes (PV1, PV2, and PV3) complexed with their cellular receptor, PV receptor (PVR or CD155), were determined by cryoelectron microscopy. Both glycosylated and fully deglycosylated CD155 exhibited similar binding sites and orientations in the viral canyon for all three PV serotypes, showing that all three serotypes use a common mechanism for cell entry. Difference maps between the glycosylated and deglycosylated CD155 complexes determined the sites of the carbohydrate moieties that, in turn, helped to verify the position of the receptor relative to the viral surface. The proximity of the CD155 carbohydrate site at Asn105 to the viral surface in the receptor-virus complex suggests that it might interfere with receptor docking, an observation consistent with the properties of mutant CD155. The footprints of CD155 on PV surfaces indicate that the south rim of the canyon dominates the virus-receptor interactions and may correspond to the initial CD155 binding state of the receptor-mediated viral uncoating. In contrast, the interaction of CD155 with the north rim of the canyon, especially the region immediately outside the viral hydrophobic pocket that normally binds a cellular ""pocket factor,"" may be critical for the release of the pocket factor, decreasing the virus stability and hence initiating uncoating. The large area of the CD155 footprint on the PV surface, in comparison with other picornavirus-receptor interactions, could be a potential limitation on the viability of PV escape mutants from antibody neutralization. Many of these are likely to have lost their ability to bind CD155, resulting in there being only three PV serotypes."
11864610,Structure of the Epstein-Barr virus gp42 protein bound to the MHC class II receptor HLA-DR1.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes infectious mononucleosis, establishes long-term latent infections, and is associated with a variety of human tumors. The EBV gp42 glycoprotein binds MHC class II molecules, playing a critical role in infection of B lymphocytes. EBV gp42 belongs to the C-type lectin superfamily, with homology to NK receptors of the immune system. We report the crystal structure of gp42 bound to the human MHC class II molecule HLA-DR1. The gp42 binds HLA-DR1 using a surface site that is distinct from the canonical lectin and NK receptor ligand binding sites. At the canonical ligand binding site, gp42 forms a large hydrophobic groove, which could interact with other ligands necessary for EBV entry, providing a mechanism for coupling MHC recognition and membrane fusion."
11188697,Structures of HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoproteins from laboratory-adapted and primary isolates.,"The gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 binds sequentially to CD4 and chemokine receptors on cells to initiate virus entry. During natural infection, gp120 is a primary target of the humoral immune response, and it has evolved to resist antibody-mediated neutralization. We previously reported the structure at 2.5 A of a gp120 core from the HXBc2 laboratory-adapted isolate in complex with a 2 domain fragment of CD4 and the antigen binding fragment of a human antibody. This revealed atomic details of gp120-receptor interactions and suggested multiple mechanisms of immune evasion."
14981267,Structural basis of tyrosine sulfation and VH-gene usage in antibodies that recognize the HIV type 1 coreceptor-binding site on gp120.,"The conserved surface of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein that binds to the HIV-1 coreceptor is protected from humoral recognition by multiple layers of camouflage. Here we present sequence and genomic analyses for 12 antibodies that pierce these defenses and determine the crystal structures of 5. The data reveal mechanisms and atomic-level details for three unusual immune features: posttranslational mimicry of coreceptor by tyrosine sulfation of antibody, an alternative molecular mechanism controlling such sulfation, and highly selective V(H)-gene usage. When confronted by extraordinary viral defenses, the immune system unveils novel adaptive capabilities, with tyrosine sulfation enhancing the vocabulary of antigen recognition."
9641677,Structure of an HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein in complex with the CD4 receptor and a neutralizing human antibody.,"The entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into cells requires the sequential interaction of the viral exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with the CD4 glycoprotein and a chemokine receptor on the cell surface. These interactions initiate a fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Although gp120 can elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies, HIV eludes the immune system. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure at 2.5 A resolution of an HIV-1 gp120 core complexed with a two-domain fragment of human CD4 and an antigen-binding fragment of a neutralizing antibody that blocks chemokine-receptor binding. The structure reveals a cavity-laden CD4-gp120 interface, a conserved binding site for the chemokine receptor, evidence for a conformational change upon CD4 binding, the nature of a CD4-induced antibody epitope, and specific mechanisms for immune evasion. Our results provide a framework for understanding the complex biology of HIV entry into cells and should guide efforts to intervene."
16511036,A C-terminal segment of the V1R vasopressin receptor is unstructured in the crystal structure of its chimera with the maltose-binding protein.,"The V1 vascular vasopressin receptor (V1R) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the regulation of body-fluid osmolality, blood volume and blood pressure. Signal transduction is mediated by the third intracellular loop of this seven-transmembrane protein as well as by the C-terminal cytoplasmic segment. A chimera of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) and the C-terminal segment of V1R has been cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized. The crystals belong to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 51.10, b = 66.56, c = 115.72 A, beta = 95.99 degrees. The 1.8 A crystal structure reveals the conformation of MBP and part of the linker region of this chimera, with the C-terminal segment being unstructured. This may reflect a conformational plasticity in the C-terminal segment that may be necessary for proper function of V1R."
16177825,Crystal structure of the C3bot-RalA complex reveals a novel type of action of a bacterial exoenzyme.,"C3 exoenzymes from bacterial pathogens ADP-ribosylate and inactivate low-molecular-mass GTPases of the Rho subfamily. Ral, a Ras subfamily GTPase, binds the C3 exoenzymes from Clostridium botulinum and C. limosum with high affinity without being a substrate for ADP ribosylation. In the complex, the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of C3 is blocked, while binding of NAD and NAD-glycohydrolase activity remain. Here we report the crystal structure of C3 from C. botulinum in a complex with GDP-bound RalA at 1.8 A resolution. C3 binds RalA with a helix-loop-helix motif that is adjacent to the active site. A quaternary complex with NAD suggests a mode for ADP-ribosyltransferase inhibition. Interaction of C3 with RalA occurs at a unique interface formed by the switch-II region, helix alpha3 and the P loop of the GTPase. C3-binding stabilizes the GDP-bound conformation of RalA and blocks nucleotide release. Our data indicate that C. botulinum exoenzyme C3 is a single-domain toxin with bifunctional properties targeting Rho GTPases by ADP ribosylation and Ral by a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-like effect, which blocks nucleotide exchange."
11080483,Hepatitis C virus envelope protein E2 binds to CD81 of tamarins.,"Since recombinant envelope glycoprotein E2 of hepatitis C virus (HCV) binds to CD81 on human and chimpanzee cells, it has been suggested that CD81 may be a receptor for HCV. Humans and chimpanzees are the only species known to be susceptible to HCV infection. E2 has been reported not to bind to CD81 of the African green monkey, mouse, or rat, suggesting that binding of HCV to CD81 is species specific and may determine susceptibility to infection with HCV. We investigated the interaction between E2 of HCV and CD81 of tamarins, a group of small New World monkeys frequently used for the study of human viruses. Tamarins are not susceptible to HCV infection. Nonetheless, we found that three different forms of HCV E2 (intracellular, secreted, and cell surface-displayed) bound more efficiently to recombinant tamarin CD81 than to human CD81, as determined by ELISA and immunofluorescence. The affinity of the interaction was approximately 10-fold higher for tamarin than for human CD81. Binding of E2 to CD81 on cultured or primary tamarin cells was demonstrated by flow cytometry. In contrast to previous reports, there was also a low-affinity interaction between E2 and African green monkey CD81. Thus, the HCV E2 interaction with CD81 is not limited to humans and chimpanzees and does not predict susceptibility to HCV infection."
15173179,"Intimin types alpha, beta, and gamma bind to nucleolin with equivalent affinity but lower avidity than to the translocated intimin receptor.","The outer membrane adhesins of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Citrobacter rodentium, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 that mediate attach and efface intestinal lesions are classified as intimin alpha, beta, and gamma, respectively. Each of these intimin types binds to its cognate, bacterially encoded receptor (called Tir for translocated intimin receptor) to promote tight adherence of the organism to the host-cell plasma membrane. We previously reported that gamma intimin of EHEC O157:H7 also bound to a eucaryotic receptor that we determined was nucleolin. The objective of this study was to investigate in vitro and in vivo the interactions of intimins alpha, beta, and gamma with nucleolin in the presence of Tir from EHEC O157:H7. Protein binding experiments demonstrated that intimin of types alpha, beta, and gamma bound nucleolin with similar affinity. Moreover, all three intimin types co-localized with regions of nucleolin expressed on the surface of HEp-2 cells. When intimin alpha, beta, or gamma bound to Tir in vitro, the intimin interaction with nucleolin was blocked. Both Tir and nucleolin accumulated beneath intimin-presenting bacteria that had attached to the surface of HEp-2 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that nucleolin is involved in bacterial adherence promoted by all intimin types and that Tir and nucleolin compete for intimin during adherence."
18084305,Structural basis for the catalytic mechanism of phosphothreonine lyase.,"Salmonella SpvC belongs to a new enzyme family designated phosphothreonine lyases that irreversibly inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinases. The crystal structure of SpvC reported here reveals that the two phosphorylated residues in the substrate peptide predominantly mediate its recognition by SpvC. Substrate-induced conformational changes in SpvC sequester the phosphothreonine in a completely solvent-free environment, preventing the hydrolysis of the phosphate group and facilitating the elimination reaction."
14505569,AIP1/ALIX is a binding partner for HIV-1 p6 and EIAV p9 functioning in virus budding.,"HIV-1 and other retroviruses exit infected cells by budding from the plasma membrane, a process requiring membrane fission. The primary late assembly (L) domain in the p6 region of HIV-1 Gag mediates the detachment of the virion by recruiting host Tsg101, a component of the class E vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) machinery. We now show that HIV Gag p6 contains a second region involved in L domain function that binds AIP1, a homolog of the yeast class E Vps protein Bro1. Further, AIP1 interacts with Tsg101 and homologs of a subunit of the yeast class E Vps protein complex ESCRT-III. AIP1 also binds to the L domain in EIAV p9, and this binding correlates perfectly with L domain function. These observations identify AIP1 as a component of the viral budding machinery, which serves to link a distinct region in the L domain of HIV-1 p6 and EIAV p9 to ESCRT-III."
14519844,Divergent retroviral late-budding domains recruit vacuolar protein sorting factors by using alternative adaptor proteins.,"The release of enveloped viruses from infected cells often requires a virally encoded activity, termed a late-budding domain (L domain), encoded by essential PTAP, PPXY, or YPDL sequence motifs. PTAP-type L domains recruit one of three endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-I). However, subsequent events in viral budding are poorly defined, and neither YPDL nor PPXY-type L domains require ESCRT-I. Here, we show that ESCRT-I and other class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) factors are linked by a complex series of protein-protein interactions. In particular, interactions between ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III are bridged by AIP-1/ALIX, a mammalian orthologue of the yeast class E VPS factor, Bro1. Expression of certain ESCRT-III components as fusion proteins induces a late budding defect that afflicts all three L-domain types, suggesting that ESCRT-III integrity is required in a general manner. Notably, the prototype YPDL-type L domain encoded by equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) acts by recruiting AIP-1/ALIX and expression of a truncated form of AIP-1/ALIX or small interfering RNA-induced AIP-1/ALIX depletion specifically inhibits EIAV YPDL-type L-domain function. Overall, these findings indicate that L domains subvert a subset of class E VPS factors to mediate viral budding, some of which are required for each of the L-domain types, whereas others apparently act as adaptors to physically link specific L-domain types to the class E VPS machinery."
12767222,Role of myristylation in HIV-1 Gag assembly.,"Assembly of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) first occurs on the plasma membrane of host cells where binding is driven by strong electrostatic interactions between the N-terminal matrix (MA) domain of the structural precursor polyprotein, Gag, and the membrane. MA is also myristylated, but the exact role this modification plays is not clear. In this study, we compared the protein oligomerization and membrane binding properties of Myr(+) and Myr(-) Gag(MA) expressed in COS-1 cells. Sedimentation studies in solution showed that both the myristylated Gag precursor and the mature MA product were detected in larger complexes than their unmyristylated counterparts, and the myristylated MA protein bound liposomes with approximately 3-fold greater affinity than unmyristylated MA. Aromatic residues near the N-terminal region of the MA protein were more accessible to chymotrypsin in the unmyristylated form and, consistent with this, an epitope in the N-terminal region was more exposed. Moreover, the cyclophilin binding site in the CA domain downstream of MA was more accessible in the unmyristylated Gag protein, while the Tsg101 binding site in the C-terminal region was equally available in the unmyristylated and myristylated Gag proteins. Taken together, our results suggest that myristylation promotes assembly by inducing conformational changes and facilitating MA multimerization. This observation offers a novel role for myristylation."
10559369,Cellular motor protein KIF-4 associates with retroviral Gag.,"Previously we demonstrated that murine retroviral Gag proteins associate with a cellular motor protein, KIF-4. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we also found an association of KIF-4 with Gag proteins of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Studies performed with mammalian cell systems confirmed that the HIV-1 Gag protein associates with KIF-4. Soluble cytoplasmic proteins from cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the entire Gag-Pol precursor protein of HIV-1 or transfected with HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 were fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and further separated by size-exclusion and anion-exchange chromatographies. KIF-4 and HIV-1 Gag cofractionated in both chromatographic separations. Immunoprecipitation assays have also verified the KIF-4-Gag association. KIF-4 binds mainly to the Gag precursor (Pr55 Gag) and a matrix-capsid processing intermediate (Pr42) but not to other processed Gag products. The binding of Gag is mediated by a domain of KIF-4 proximal to the C terminus. These results, and our previous studies, raise the possibility that KIF-4 may play an important role in retrovirus Gag protein transport."
9405152,Interactions between HIV Rev and nuclear import and export factors: the Rev nuclear localisation signal mediates specific binding to human importin-beta.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev protein binds to unspliced HIV-1 pre-mRNA and exports it from the nucleus. Rev itself can ""shuttle"" between the nucleus and cytoplasm. This bi-directional transport is mediated by two specific Rev sequences: a nuclear localisation signal (NLS), which overlaps the RNA-binding domain, and a distinct nuclear export signal (NES). In this study we characterised new monoclonal antibodies that bind different epitopes of Rev, including the import and export sequences. In RNA bandshift assays, we observed that formation of a multimeric complex between Rev and its target RNA completely masks the Rev NLS, whereas the NES remains readily accessible. We then tested for signal-mediated interactions between Rev and different nuclear transport receptors, using mutations in the Rev NES or NLS to control for specificity. Extensive biochemical analyses did not reveal any direct NES-dependent interaction between Rev (free or RNA-bound) and the previously proposed export co-factors, human RIP/Rab and eIF-5A. By contrast, similar tests showed that Rev binds directly via its arginine-rich NLS to the human nuclear import receptor, importin-beta. This interaction was highly specific and was abolished by mutation in the Rev NLS. Importin-beta did not bind to the RNA-bound form of Rev, providing a mechanism to ensure that Rev is imported only following release of its RNA cargo. Unlike many NLS-containing proteins that bind stably to an importin-alpha/beta heterodimer, the binding of Rev to importin-beta was actually blocked by importin-alpha receptor. Our findings suggest that Rev and importin-alpha bind (via an arginine-rich sequence) to a similar region on importin-beta. In addition, we show that the complex between Rev and importin-beta can be dissociated by the nuclear Ran GTPase, but only when Ran is in the GTP-bound form. The series of interactions we describe provide a novel pathway for the import of Rev across the nuclear pore complex, and a mechanism for its release into the nucleoplasm."
8626563,"In vitro interaction between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein and splicing factor ASF/SF2-associated protein, p32.","Continuous replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 requires the expression of the regulatory protein Rev, which binds to the Rev response element (RRE) and up-regulates the cytoplasmic appearance of singly spliced and unspliced mRNA species. It has been demonstrated that the murine protein YL2 interacts with Rev in vivo and modulates the activity of Rev (Luo, Y., Yu, H., and Peterlin, B. M. (1994) J. Virol. 68, 3850-3856). Here we show that the YL2 human homologue, the p32 protein, which co-purifies with alternative splicing factor ASF/SF2, interacts directly with the basic domain of Rev in vitro and that the Rev-p32 complex is resistant to high concentrations of salt or nonionic detergent. Protein footprinting data suggest that Rev interacts specifically with amino acids within the 196-208 region of p32. An analysis of the ternary complex, formed among p32, Rev, and RRE RNA, shows that Rev can bridge the association of p32 and RRE. Furthermore, we demonstrate that exogenously added p32 specifically relieves the inhibition of splicing in vitro exerted by the basic domain of Rev. Our data are consistent with a model in which p32 functions as a link between Rev and the cellular splicing apparatus."
15766529,AP-3 directs the intracellular trafficking of HIV-1 Gag and plays a key role in particle assembly.,"Gag proteins direct the process of retroviral particle assembly and form the major protein constituents of the viral core. The matrix region of the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein plays a critical role in the transport of Gag to the plasma membrane assembly site. Recent evidence indicates that Gag trafficking to late endosomal compartments, including multivesicular bodies, occurs prior to viral particle budding from the plasma membrane. Here we demonstrate that the matrix region of HIV-1 Gag interacts directly with the delta subunit of the AP-3 complex, and that this interaction plays an important functional role in particle assembly. Disruption of this interaction eliminated Gag trafficking to multivesicular bodies and diminished HIV particle formation. These studies illuminate an early step in retroviral particle assembly and provide evidence that the trafficking of Gag to late endosomes is part of a productive particle assembly pathway."
9880543,"HEED, the product of the human homolog of the murine eed gene, binds to the matrix protein of HIV-1.","heed, the human homolog of mouse eed and Drosophila esc, two members of the trithorax (trx) and Polycomb group (Pc-G) of genes, was isolated by screening an activated lymphocyte cDNA library versus the immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) MA protein used as a bait in a two-hybrid system in yeast. The human EED protein (HEED) had 99. 5% identity with the mouse EED protein and contained seven WD repeats. Two heed gene transcripts were identified, with a putative 407-nucleotide-long intron, giving rise to two HEED protein isoforms of 535 and 494 residues in length, respectively. The shorter HEED isoform, originated from the unspliced message, lacked the seventh WD repeat. HEED was found to bind to MA protein in vitro, as efficiently as in vivo in yeast cells. Site-directed mutagenesis and phage biopanning suggested that the interaction between HEED and MA involved the N-terminal region of the MA protein, including the first polybasic signal, in a MA conformation-dependent manner. In the HEED protein, however, two discrete linear MA-binding motifs were identified within residues 388-403, overlapping the origin of the fifth WD repeat. Deletion of the C-terminal 41 residues of HEED, spanning the seventh WD repeat, as in the 494-residue HEED protein, was detrimental to HEED-MA interaction in vivo, suggesting the existence of another C-terminal binding site and/or a conformational role of the HEED C-terminal domain in the MA-HEED interaction. MA and HEED proteins co-localized within the nucleus of co-transfected human cells and of recombinant baculovirus co-infected insect cells. This and the failure of HEED to bind to uncleaved GAG precursor suggested a role of HEED at the early stages of virus infection, rather than late in the virus life cycle."
15994808,Analysis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag ubiquitination.,"Ubiquitin is important for the release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and several other retroviruses, but the functional significance of Gag ubiquitination is unknown. To address this problem, we decided to analyze Gag ubiquitination in detail. A low percentage of the HIV-1 p6 protein has previously been shown to be ubiquitinated, and published mutagenesis data suggested that Gag ubiquitination is largely lost upon mutation of the two lysine residues in p6. In this study, we show that Gag proteins lacking the p6 domain or the two lysine residues within p6 are ubiquitinated at levels comparable to those of the wild-type Gag protein. We detected monoubiquitinated forms of the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC) proteins in mature virus preparations. Protease digestion of Gag polyproteins extracted from immature virions indicated that ubiquitinated MA, CA, and possibly NC are as abundant as ubiquitinated p6. The HIV-1 late-domain motifs PTAP and LRSLF were not required for Gag ubiquitination, and mutation of the PTAP motif even resulted in an increase in the amount of Gag-Ub conjugates detected. Finally, at steady state, ubiquitinated Gag proteins were not enriched in either membrane-associated or virus-derived Gag fractions. In summary, these results indicate that HIV-1 Gag can be monoubiquitinated in all domains and that ubiquitination of lysine residues outside p6 may thus contribute to viral release and/or infectivity."
16775314,Cumulative mutations of ubiquitin acceptor sites in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag cause a late budding defect.,"The p6 domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag has long been known to be monoubiquitinated. We have previously shown that the MA, CA, and NC domains are also monoubiquitinated at low levels (E. Gottwein and H. G. Krausslich, J. Virol. 79:9134-9144, 2005). While several lines of evidence support a role for ubiquitin in virus release, the relevance of Gag ubiquitination is unclear. To directly address the function of Gag ubiquitination, we constructed Gag variants in which lysine residues in the NC, SP2, and p6 domains were mutated to arginine either in individual domains or in combination. Using these mutants, we showed that in addition to MA, CA, NC, and p6, SP2 is also mono- or di-ubiquitinated at levels comparable to those of the other domains. Replacement of all lysine residues in only one of the domains had minor effects on virus release, while cumulative mutations in NC and SP2 or in NC and p6 resulted in an accumulation of late budding structures, as observed by electron microscopy analysis. Strikingly, replacement of all lysine residues downstream of CA led to a significant reduction in virus release kinetics and a fivefold accumulation of late viral budding structures compared to wild-type levels. These results indicate that ubiquitination of lysine residues in Gag in the vicinity of the viral late domain is important for HIV-1 budding, while no specific lysine residue may be needed and individual domains can functionally substitute. This is consistent with Gag ubiquitination being functionally involved in a transient protein interaction network at the virus budding site."
9525617,Ubiquitin is covalently attached to the p6Gag proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus and to the p12Gag protein of Moloney murine leukemia virus.,"Host proteins are incorporated into retroviral virions during assembly and budding. We have examined three retroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV), for the presence of ubiquitin inside each of these virions. After a protease treatment to remove exterior viral as well as contaminating cellular proteins, the proteins remaining inside the virion were analyzed. The results presented here show that all three virions incorporate ubiquitin molecules at approximately 10% of the level of Gag found in virions. In addition to free ubiquitin, covalent ubiquitin-Gag complexes were detected, isolated, and characterized from all three viruses. Our immunoblot and protein sequencing results on treated virions showed that approximately 2% of either HIV-1 or SIV p6Gag was covalently attached to a single ubiquitin molecule inside the respective virions and that approximately 2 to 5% of the p12Gag in Mo-MuLV virions was monoubiquitinated. These results show that ubiquitination of Gag is conserved among these retroviruses and occurs in the p6Gag portion of the Gag polyprotein, a region that is likely to be involved in assembly and budding."
11112487,Ubiquitination of HIV-1 and MuLV Gag.,"Our previous biochemical studies of HIV-1 and MuLV virions isolated and identified mature Gag products, HIV-1 p6(Gag) and MuLV p12(Gag), that were conjugated to a single ubiquitin. To study the importance of the monoubiquitination of Gag, a series of lysine to arginine mutants were constructed that eliminated ubiquitination at one or both of the lysines in HIV-1(NL4-3) p6(Gag) and both lysines in Moloney MuLV p12(Gag). HPLC and immunoblot analysis of the HIV-1 mutants demonstrated that either of the lysines in p6(Gag), K27 or K33, could be monoubiquitinated. However, infectivity assays showed that monoubiquitination of HIV-1 p6(Gag) or MuLV p12(Gag) is not required for viral replication in vitro. Pulse-chase radiolabeling of HIV-1-producing cells revealed that monoubiquitination of p6(Gag) does not affect the short-term release of virus from the cell, the maturation of Pr55(Gag), or the sensitivity of these processes to proteasome inhibitors. Experiments with protease-deficient HIV-1 showed that Pr55(Gag) can be monoubiquitinated, suggesting that p6(Gag) is first modified as a domain within Gag. Examination of the proteins inside an HIV-1 mutant found that free ubiquitin was incorporated into the virions in the absence of the lysines in p6(Gag), showing that the ubiquitin inside the virus is not initially brought in as a p6(Gag) conjugate. Although our results establish that monoubiquitination of p6(Gag) and p12(Gag) is not required for viral replication in vitro, this modification may be a by-product of interactions between Gag and cellular proteins during assembly and budding."
11087859,"Proteasome inhibition interferes with gag polyprotein processing, release, and maturation of HIV-1 and HIV-2.","Retrovirus assembly and maturation involve folding and transport of viral proteins to the virus assembly site followed by subsequent proteolytic cleavage of the Gag polyprotein within the nascent virion. We report that inhibiting proteasomes severely decreases the budding, maturation, and infectivity of HIV. Although processing of the Env glycoproteins is not changed, proteasome inhibitors inhibit processing of Gag polyprotein by the viral protease without affecting the activity of the HIV-1 viral protease itself, as demonstrated by in vitro processing of HIV-1 Gag polyprotein Pr55. Furthermore, this effect occurs independently of the virus release function of the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu and is not limited to HIV-1, as proteasome inhibitors also reduce virus release and Gag processing of HIV-2. Electron microscopy analysis revealed ultrastructural changes in budding virions similar to mutants in the late assembly domain of p6(gag), a C-terminal domain of Pr55 required for efficient virus maturation and release. Proteasome inhibition reduced the level of free ubiquitin in HIV-1-infected cells and prevented monoubiquitination of p6(gag). Consistent with this, viruses with mutations in PR or p6(gag) were resistant to detrimental effects mediated by proteasome inhibitors. These results indicate the requirement for an active proteasome/ubiquitin system in release and maturation of infectious HIV particles and provide a potential pharmaceutical strategy for interfering with retrovirus replication."
11991975,Late assembly domain function can exhibit context dependence and involves ubiquitin residues implicated in endocytosis.,"Retroviral Gag polyproteins contain regions that promote the separation of virus particles from the plasma membrane and from each other. These Gag regions are often referred to as late assembly (L) domains. The L domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is in the C-terminal p6(gag) domain and harbors an essential P(T/S)APP motif, whereas the L domains of oncoretroviruses are in the N-terminal half of the Gag precursor and have a PPXY core motif. We recently observed that L domains induce the ubiquitination of a minimal HIV-1 Gag construct and that point mutations which abolish L domain activity prevent Gag ubiquitination. In that study, a peptide from the Ebola virus L domain with overlapping P(T/S)APP and PPXY motifs showed exceptional activity in promoting Gag ubiquitination and the release of virus-like particles. We now show that a substitution which disrupts the PPXY motif but leaves the P(T/S)APP motif intact abolishes L domain activity in the minimal Gag context, but not in the context of a near full-length HIV-1 Gag precursor. Our results reveal that the P(T/S)APP motif does not function autonomously and indicate that the HIV-1 nucleocapsid-p1 region, which is proximal to p6(gag), can cooperate with the conserved L domain core motif. We have also examined the effects of ubiquitin mutants on virus-like particle production, and the results indicate that residues required for the endocytosis function of ubiquitin are also involved in virus budding."
12134013,The carboxy-terminal region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protein Rev has multiple roles in mediating CRM1-related Rev functions.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein, Rev, mediates the nuclear export of unspliced and singly spliced viral mRNAs by bridging viral RNA and export receptor human CRM1 (hCRM1). Ribonucleoprotein complex formation, including the oligomerization of Rev proteins on viral RNA, must occur to allow export. We show here that Rev-Rev interactions, which are a basis of complex formation, can be initiated without cellular factors and are subsequently enhanced by hCRM1-Ran-GTP. Furthermore, we reveal functions for the Rev carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) region, which is well conserved among many HIV-1 strains, and for which no function has been reported. This region is required for the efficient binding of Rev to hCRM1 and consequently for nuclear export, Rev-Rev dimerization, and full Rev transactivator activity. Consistent with these results, a HIV-1 proviral plasmid that expresses a C-terminally truncated Rev mutant protein produces smaller amounts of the p24 antigen than does a plasmid that possesses an intact rev gene. These results indicate the functional importance of the C-terminal region for full Rev activity, which leads to efficient HIV-1 replication."
16434471,Innate antiviral response targets HIV-1 release by the induction of ubiquitin-like protein ISG15.,"The goal of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which type I IFN inhibits assembly and release of HIV-1 virions. Our study revealed that the IFN-induced ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 mimics the IFN effect and inhibits release of HIV-1 virions without having any effect on the synthesis of HIV-1 proteins in the cells. ISG15 expression specifically inhibited ubiquitination of Gag and Tsg101 and disrupted the interaction of the Gag L domain with Tsg101, but conjugation of ISG15 to Gag or Tsg101 was not detected. The inhibition of Gag-Tsg101 interaction was also detected in HIV-1 infected, IFN-treated cells. Elimination of ISG15 expression by small interfering RNA reversed the IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication and release of virions. These results indicated a critical role for ISG15 in the IFN-mediated inhibition of late stages of HIV-1 assembly and release and pointed to a mechanism by which the innate antiviral response targets the cellular endosomal trafficking pathway used by HIV-1 to exit the cell. Identification of ISG15 as the critical component in IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 release advances the understanding of the IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication and uncovers a target for the anti HIV-1 therapy."
10364286,Translation elongation factor 1-alpha interacts specifically with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag polyprotein.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gag-encoded proteins play key functions at almost all stages of the viral life cycle. Since these functions may require association with cellular factors, the HIV-1 matrix protein (MA) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify MA-interacting proteins. MA was found to interact with elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1alpha), an essential component of the translation machinery that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes. EF1alpha was then shown to bind the entire HIV-1 Gag polyprotein. This interaction is mediated not only by MA, but also by the nucleocapsid domain, which provides a second, independent EF1alpha-binding site on the Gag polyprotein. EF1alpha is incorporated within HIV-1 virion membranes, where it is cleaved by the viral protease and protected from digestion by exogenously added subtilisin. The specificity of the interaction is demonstrated by the fact that EF1alpha does not bind to nonlentiviral MAs and does not associate with Moloney murine leukemia virus virions. The Gag-EF1alpha interaction appears to be mediated by RNA, in that basic residues in MA and NC are required for binding to EF1alpha, RNase disrupts the interaction, and a Gag mutant with undetectable EF1alpha-binding activity is impaired in its ability to associate with tRNA in cells. Finally, the interaction between MA and EF1alpha impairs translation in vitro, a result consistent with a previously proposed model in which inhibition of translation by the accumulation of Gag serves to release viral RNA from polysomes, permitting the RNA to be packaged into nascent virions."
16580072,HIV-1 Vif protein blocks the cytidine deaminase activity of B-cell specific AID in E. coli by a similar mechanism of action.,"HIV-1 Vif protein protects viral replication in non-permissive cells by inducing degradation of APOBEC3G via ubiquitination and proteasomal pathway, although new studies indicate a putative role in Vif's direct inhibition of APOBEC3G. APOBEC3G is member of a homologous family of proteins with cytidine deaminase activity expressed with characteristic tissue specificity, that in humans consist of APOBEC1, APOBEC2, APOBEC3A-H, APOBEC4 and the activation-induced deaminase (AID), a B lymphoid protein necessary for somatic hypermutation, gene conversion and class switch recombination. In this work we show that Vif can counteract AID's activity in E. coli in absence of specific eukaryotic co-factors necessary for AID induced somatic hypermutation, gene conversion and to stimulate class switch recombination in B-cells. We show that AID inhibition is mediated by a direct protein-protein interaction via unique amino acid D118 an homologous mutant responsible for the species-specific restriction of HIV-1 Vif protein existent for APOBEC3G. These results raise the hypothesis that Vif related proteins can act as a broad inhibitor of deaminase activity. Moreover as AID and Vif evolved in different cellular environments, these results may indicate that Vif related proteins might mimic cellular factors that interact with a structural conserved domain of cytidine deaminases during evolution."
15539149,The caveolin-1 binding domain of HIV-1 glycoprotein gp41 is an efficient B cell epitope vaccine candidate against virus infection.,"Caveolin-1 is a scaffolding protein that organizes and concentrates specific ligands within the caveolae membranes. We identified a conserved caveolin-1 binding motif in the HIV-1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp41 and designed several synthetic peptides, referred to as CBD1, corresponding to the consensus caveolin-1 binding domain in gp41. In rabbits, these peptides elicit the production of antibodies that inhibit infection of primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes by various primary HIV-1 isolates. Interestingly, gp41 exists as a stable complex with caveolin-1 in HIV-infected cells. Anti-CBD1 peptide antibodies, therefore, might be functional by inhibiting the potential interaction of gp41 with caveolin-1. Because of their capacity to elicit antibodies that inhibit the different clades of HIV-1, CBD1-based peptides may represent a novel synthetic universal B cell epitope vaccine candidate for HIV/AIDS. Moreover, such peptides could also have an application as a therapeutic vaccine since CBD1-specific antibodies are rare in HIV-infected individuals from several geographic origins."
10432305,"Cloning and characterization of hIF2, a human homologue of bacterial translation initiation factor 2, and its interaction with HIV-1 matrix.","The cDNA for a human homologue (hIF2) of bacterial (bIF2) and yeast (yIF2) translation initiation factor two (IF2) has been identified during a screen for proteins which interact with HIV-1 matrix. The hIF2 cDNA encodes a 1220-amino-acid protein with a predicted relative molecular mass of 139 kDa, though endogeneous hIF2 migrates anomalously on SDS/PAGE at 180 kDa. hIF2 has an extended N-terminus compared with its homologues, although its central GTP-binding domain and C-terminus are highly conserved, with 58% sequence identity with yIF2. We have confirmed that hIF2 is required for general translation in human cells by generation of a point mutation in the P-loop of the GTP-binding domain. This mutant protein behaves in a transdominant manner in transient transfections and leads to a significant decrease in the translation of a reporter gene. hIF2 interacts directly with HIV-1 matrix and Gag in vitro, and the protein complex can be immunoprecipitated from human cells. This interaction appears to block hIF2 function, since purified matrix protein inhibits translation in a reticulocyte lysate. hIF2 does not correspond to any of the previously characterized translation initiation factors identified in mammals, but its essential role in translation appears to have been conserved from bacteria to humans."
10506147,The multifunctional herpes simplex virus IE63 protein interacts with heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein K and with casein kinase 2.,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), the prototype alpha-herpesvirus, causes several prominent diseases. The HSV-1 immediate early (IE) protein IE63 (ICP27) is the only regulatory gene with a homologue in every mammalian and avian herpesvirus sequenced so far. IE63 is a multifunctional protein affecting transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, and it can shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. To identify interacting cellular proteins, a HeLa cDNA library was screened in the yeast two-hybrid system using IE63 as bait. Several interacting proteins were identified including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a multifunctional protein like IE63, and the beta subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), a protein kinase, and interacting regions were mapped. Confirmation of interactions was provided by fusion protein binding assays, co-immunoprecipitation from infected cells, and CK2 activity assays. hnRNP K co-immunoprecipitated from infected cells with anti-IE63 serum was a more rapidly migrating subfraction than hnRNP K immunoprecipitated by anti-hnRNP K serum. Using anti-IE63 serum, both IE63 and hnRNP K were phosphorylated in vitro by CK2, while in immunoprecipitates using anti-hnRNP K serum, IE63 but not hnRNP K was phosphorylated by CK2. These data provide important new insights into how this key viral regulatory protein exerts its functions."
21068253,Hepatitis B virus regulatory HBx protein binds to adaptor protein IPS-1 and inhibits the activation of beta interferon.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) encodes the regulatory HBx protein, which is required for virus replication, although its specific role(s) in the replication cycle remains under investigation. An immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry approach was used to identify four novel HBx binding proteins from the cytoplasmic fraction of HBx transgenic mouse livers. One of these HBx binding partners is beta interferon promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), an adaptor protein that plays a critical role in mediating retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling, which leads to the activation of beta interferon (IFN-β). The HBx-IPS-1 protein interaction was confirmed in plasmid-transfected HepG2 cells by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting. We hypothesized that HBx might alter IPS-1 function since proteins of hepatitis C virus and hepatitis A virus similarly bind IPS-1 and target it for inactivation. The effect of HBx on IPS-1-mediated IFN-β signaling was tested in transfected 293T and HepG2 cells, and we show that HBx inhibits double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-mediated IFN-β activation in a dose-dependent manner when expressed either alone or within the context of HBV replication. However, HBx does not inhibit poly(I:C)-activated IFN-β signaling. These results demonstrate that HBx interferes with the RIG-I pathway of innate immunity. Hepatitis B virus now joins hepatitis C virus and hepatitis A virus in targeting the same innate immune response pathway, presumably as a shared strategy to benefit replication of these viruses in the liver."
9622505,Solution structure of the cytoplasmic domain of the human CD4 glycoprotein by CD and 1H NMR spectroscopy: implications for biological functions.,"The human T cell receptor CD4 is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein that is involved in T cell activation and also acts as the primary coreceptor for human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV). Here the structure of a synthetic 38 amino acid peptide corresponding to the complete cytoplasmic domain of CD4 (CD4CYTO) has been investigated under a variety of solution conditions using a combination of circular dichroism and homonuclear two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the presence of the membrane mimetic 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), a conformational change of CD4CYTO from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure was observed. In keeping with this, CD4CYTO has the potential to associate with membranes as demonstrated by binding studies of in vitro phosphorylated CD4CYTO with microsomal membranes. Both chemical shift and nuclear Overhauser enhancement data in 50% 2,2, 2-trifluoroethanol solution provide direct experimental evidence for the predominance of a short amphiphatic alpha-helix that is approximately 4 turns in length and extends from positions Arg-402 to Lys-417. The present data provide, for the first time, compelling experimental evidence that only a fraction of CD4CYTO has a propensity for adopting secondary structure under conditions that are assumed to exist at or near to the membrane surface and that this alpha-helical structure is located in the membrane-proximal region of CD4CYTO. The N-terminal residues, that link the alpha-helix to the transmembrane anchor of CD4, and a substantial C-terminal portion (14-18 residues) of CD4CYTO are unstructured under the solution conditions investigated. Correlation of our structural data with recent studies on the biological activity of CD4CYTO indicates that the alpha-helix is of crucial importance for the interaction of CD4 with Nef and Vpu in the process of HIV-mediated CD4 down-regulation."
8830660,Extended binding sites of cyclophilin as revealed by the interaction with HIV-1 Gag polyprotein derived oligopeptides.,"Oligopeptides derived from the gag polyprotein (Pr55gag) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) segment were used to evaluate the extension of the putative binding region for the complex of Pr55gag and the human cytosolic peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) 18 kDa cyclophilin (Cyp18). Five N-terminally acetylated, C-terminally amidated oligopeptides containing one (HIV-1 Gag218-224; 1), two (HIV-1 Gag218-226 and HIV-1 Gag217-224; 2 and 3, respectively), three (HIV-1 Gag217-226; 4) or four (HIV-1 Gag213-237; 5) proline residues were synthesized. Using competition experiments with a standard substrate the binding affinities to Cypl8 of the synthesized peptides were determined. The IC50 value of 184 microM for the 25-mer peptide 5 was fivefold or more lower than those of the peptides 1-4 lacking one or more prolines. Failure of competition in assays containing enzymes of other PPIase families by millimolar concentrations of 5 revealed a Cyp18 specific interaction involving the active site of the enzyme. In its far UV circular dichroism, aqueous solutions of 5 display properties of random coil conformation, but spectra were also consistent with a small contribution of proline specific secondary structures. However, a proline-rich peptide typical of forming left-handed polyproline II helices did not compete for the active site of Cypl8. The results demonstrate that the putative binding region of HIV-1 gag polyprotein has a certain degree of binding affinity to the PPIase site of Cyp18, and may add a previously unrecognized topological component to the known subsite specificity of cyclophilins."
9337866,Conformational state of a 25-mer peptide from the cyclophilin-binding loop of the HIV type 1 capsid protein.,"Recently a 25-residue part of Gag polyprotein from HIV type 1 (HIV-1) was reported to bind to the cytosolic 18 kDa cyclophilin (Cyp18) with an IC50 value of 180 microM. This peptide corresponds to the Cyp18-binding domain of HIV-1 Gag. A replacement of Gly with Ala in the cyclophilin-binding loop of HIV-1 Gag polyprotein results in the prevention of the packaging of Cyp18 into virions. We found only two conformers of this peptide among 16 possible expected conformers, owing to cis/trans isomerization of four peptidyl-prolyl bonds. Although this finding implicates the existence of a stabilizing structure, we were not able to detect secondary structure formation by 1H-NMR and CD spectroscopy. We characterized the peptide as a substrate for Cyp18 by two-dimensional exchange 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Surprisingly, we found similar binding characteristics for a peptide corresponding to 25-mer peptide containing the above-mentioned Gly to Ala substitution."
8189522,Cellular protein modulates effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev.,"Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 requires expression of the viral trans activator Rev. Rev binds to a highly structured RNA, the Rev response element, which is present in singly spliced and unspliced genomic viral RNAs. Although Rev helps to transport these transcripts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the mechanism(s) involved is not fully understood. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a murine protein (YL2) that interacts with the basic domain of Rev, which is essential for the function of Rev in vivo and for the inhibitory splicing activity of Rev in vitro. YL2 has 92% identity to a human 32-kDa protein (p32), which copurifies with alternative splicing factor SF2/ASF. Furthermore, we found that whereas expression of YL2 greatly potentiated the activity of Rev, antisense YL2 transcripts blocked the effects of Rev in mammalian cells. YL2 also increased the activities of Rex on the Rex response element and of hybrid Rev proteins fused to Tat and the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 on their respective RNAs. Thus, YL2 or p32 is a cellular protein that modulates the function of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev."
12805422,A nuclear kinesin-like protein interacts with and stimulates the activity of the leucine-rich nuclear export signal of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 rev protein.,"The Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is essential for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced and partially spliced HIV mRNAs containing the Rev response element (RRE). In a yeast two-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell-derived cDNA expression library for human factors interacting with the Rev leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES), we identified a kinesin-like protein, REBP (Rev/Rex effector binding protein), highly homologous to Kid, the carboxy-terminal 75-residue region of which interacts specifically with the NESs of HIV-1 Rev, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Rex, and equine infectious anemia virus Rev but not with functionally inactive mutants thereof. REBP is a nuclear protein that colocalizes with Rev in the nucleoplasm and nuclear periphery of transfected cells. Specific, albeit weak, interaction between REBP and Rev could be demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitation assays in BSC-40 cells. REBP can modestly enhance Rev-dependent RRE-linked reporter gene expression both independently and in cooperation with the nucleoporin cofactor Rab/hRIP. Thus, REBP displays the characteristics expected of an authentic mediator of Rev NES function and may play a role in RRE RNA transport during HIV infection."
10358091,A new nucleoporin-like protein interacts with both HIV-1 Rev nuclear export signal and CRM-1.,"The HIV-1 Rev is a shuttling protein required for the nuclear export of unspliced and partially spliced viral mRNA. In this study, we have identified a new Rev-interacting protein, that specifically interacts with the Rev nuclear export signal both in yeast and mammalian cells. This protein has features found in nucleoporins including many phenylalanine-glycine repeats, a very high serine content, a putative zinc finger, and a coiled-coil domain; we thus called it NLP-1 (nucleoporin-like protein 1). In addition, gene expression analysis and wheat germ agglutinin chromatography experiments suggested that NLP-1 is an ubiquitous O-glycosylated nuclear protein. Recently, a cellular factor called CRM-1 has been shown to be an essential nuclear export factor interacting directly with nuclear export signals including the Rev nuclear export signal in a RanGTP-dependent manner. We show here that NLP-1, like the previously described Rev-interacting protein hRIP/Rab and several nucleoporins, also interacts with CRM-1 both in yeast and mammalian cells."
10619843,The VacA toxin of Helicobacter pylori identifies a new intermediate filament-interacting protein.,"The VacA toxin produced by Helicobacter pylori acts inside cells and induces the formation of vacuoles arising from late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Using VacA as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell library, we have identified a novel protein of 54 kDa (VIP54), which interacts specifically with VacA, as indicated by co-immunoprecipitation and binding experiments. VIP54 is expressed in cultured cells and many tissues, with higher expression in the brain, muscle, kidney and liver. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-VIP54 affinity- purified antibodies shows a fibrous pattern typical of intermediate filaments. Double label immunofluorescence performed on various cell lines with antibodies specific to different intermediate filament proteins revealed that VIP54 largely co-distributes with vimentin. In contrast to known intermediate filament proteins, VIP54 is predicted to contain approximately 50% of helical segments, but no extended coiled-coil regions. The possible involvement of this novel protein in interactions between intermediate filaments and late endosomal compartments is discussed."
9499022,Cloning and characterization of a novel hepatitis B virus x binding protein that inhibits viral replication.,"The hepatitis B virus and the mammalian hepadnavirus genomes encode for a short open reading frame called x. Expression of the protein product (HBx) appears necessary for establishment of natural infection. However, in vitro studies have suggested a multifunctional role for HBx as an indirect transcriptional transactivator of a variety of different viral and cellular promoters. Indeed, HBx has no known direct DNA binding properties but may interact with transcription factors as well as activate intracellular signaling pathways associated with cell growth. To further address the possible functional role of HBx in the life cycle of hepatitis B virus, we performed an analysis using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a cDNA library derived from a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line with a HBx fusion bait in an attempt to identify cellular partners that may bind to and alter the biologic properties of HBx. A HBx-interacting protein that specifically complexes with the carboxy terminus of wild-type HBx was identified and designated XIP. This 9.6-kDa protein is capable of binding to HBx in vitro, and transient and stable expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells abolishes the transactivation properties of HBx on luciferase constructs driven by AP-1 and endogenous hepatitis B virus enhancer/promoter elements. Investigation of the role of XIP in hepatitis B virus replication in differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma cells revealed that XIP expression reduces wild-type hepatitis B virus replication to levels observed following transfection with an HBx-minus virus. In contrast, the replication levels of the duck hepatitis B virus, a hepadnavirus that lacks the x open reading frame, were unchanged in the context of XIP expression. We propose that one of the physiologic functions of the cellular protein XIP is to negatively regulate HBx activity and thus to alter the replication life cycle of the virus."
8972861,"XAP2, a novel hepatitis B virus X-associated protein that inhibits X transactivation.","The hepatitis B virus X protein is a promiscuous transcriptional transactivator. Transactivation by the X protein is most likely mediated through binding to different cellular factors. Using the yeast two-hybrid method, we have isolated a clone that encodes a novel X-associated cellular protein: XAP2. X and XAP2 interactions also occur in vitro. Antiserum raised against XAP2 recognizes a cytoplasmic protein with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa. The interaction between X and XAP2 requires a small region on X containing amino acids 13-26. From Northern blot analyses, XAP2 is ubiquitously expressed in both liver-derived and non-liver-derived cell lines as well as in normal non-liver tissues. In contrast, XAP2 is expressed in very low level in the normal human liver. In transfection assays, overexpression of XAP2 abolishes transactivation by the X protein. Based on these results, we suggest that XAP2 is an important cellular negative regulator of the X protein, and that X-XAP2 interaction may play a role in HBV pathology."
8806575,Interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of HIV-1 Vpu and CD4: role of Vpu residues involved in CD4 interaction and in vitro CD4 degradation.,"The Vpu and CD4 cytoplasmic domains were found, by using a two-hybrid assay in yeast, to interact in the absence of their membrane anchor domains. Studies on several deletion and point mutants revealed that the overall structure of the Vpu cytoplasmic domain is required for this interaction. The Vpu amino acid residues involved in the interaction with CD4 were identified. Deletion of the C-terminal residues of Vpu, required for CD4 degradation, as well as the double mutation on the casein kinase II phosphorylation sites S52N-S56N, also involved in CD4 degradation, resulted in the loss of interaction with CD4 and in the inability to induce CD4 degradation. These results suggest that the ability of Vpu to mediate the degradation of CD4 is linked to its capacity to physically interact with CD4. However, additional mutagenesis on the S52 site revealed that the interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of Vpu and CD4 is not sufficient for in vitro Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation."
8513493,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag protein binds to cyclophilins A and B.,"Retroviral Gag protein is capable of directing the assembly of virion particles independent of other retroviral elements and plays an important role early in the infection of a cell. Using the GAL4 two hybrid system, we screened a cDNA expression library and identified two host proteins, cyclophillins (CyPs) A and B, which interact specifically with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag polyprotein Pr55gag. Glutathione S-transferase-CyP fusion proteins bind tightly to Pr55gag in vitro, as well as to the HIV-1 capsid protein p24. Cyclosporin A efficiently disrupts the Gag-CyPA interaction and less efficiently disrupts the Gag-CyPB interaction. The Gag-CyP interaction may be important for the HIV-1 life cycle and may be relevant to the pathology caused by this immunosuppressive virus."
8659115,Evidence for direct association of Vpr and matrix protein p17 within the HIV-1 virion.,"Vpr is one of the auxiliary proteins of HIV-1 and is selectively incorporated into the virion by a process involving the C-terminal p6 portion of the Gag precursor Pr55. Vpr and the matrix protein p17 are the components of the viral preintegration complex and appear to play important roles in the nuclear transport of proviral DNA in nondividing cells. In the present study, we have demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments that Vpr associates with matrix protein p17 but not with capsid protein p24 within the HIV-1 virion. Experiments employing the yeast two-hybrid GAL4 assay for protein-protein interactions also demonstrated a direct association between Vpr and the C-terminal region of matrix protein p17. Association of Vpr and the matrix protein p17 within the mature virion is consistent with their collaborative role in the nuclear transportation of the viral preintegration complex in nondividing cells such as macrophages."
8676452,Binding of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag polyprotein to cyclophilin A is mediated by the central region of capsid and requires Gag dimerization.,"The cellular peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (CyPA) is incorporated into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions via direct contacts with the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein. Disruption of the Gag-CyPA interaction leads to the production of HIV-1 particles lacking CyPA; these virions are noninfectious, indicating that contacts between CyPA and Gag are necessary for HIV-1 replication. Here, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system in conjunction with an in vitro binding assay to identify the minimal domain of Gag required for binding to CyPA. Analysis of a panel of gag deletion mutants in the two-hybrid system indicated that a region spanning the central portion of the capsid (CA) domain was sufficient for interactions with CyPA, but discrepancies between results obtained in different fusion protein contexts suggested that multimerization of Gag might also be necessary for binding to CyPA. Consistent with a requirement for multimerization, the binding of Gag to CyPA in vitro required a region within the nucleocapsid (NC) domain shown previously to be important for Gag self-association. Substitution of a heterologous dimerization motif for the region from NC also promoted specific binding to CyPA, confirming that interactions with CyPA are dependent on Gag multimerization. Fusion of the heterologous dimerization motif to a 100-amino-acid domain from CA was sufficient for binding to CyPA in vitro. These results define the minimal CyPA-binding domain within Gag and provide insight into the mechanism by which CyPA is incorporated into HIV-1 virions."
14554087,Functional analysis of the interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev nuclear export signal with its cofactors.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev-mediated nuclear export of viral RNAs involves the interaction of its leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES) with nuclear cofactors. In yeast two-hybrid screens of a human lymph node derived cDNA expression library, we identified the human nucleoporin Nup98 as a highly specific and potent interactor of the Rev NES. Using an extensive panel of nuclear export positive and negative mutants of the functionally homologous NESs of the HIV-1 Rev, human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Rex, and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) Rev proteins, physiologically significant interaction of hNup98 with the various NESs was demonstrated. Missense mutations in the yeast nuclear export factor Crm1p that abrogated Rev NES interaction with the XXFG repeat-containing nucleoporin, Rab/hRIP, had minimal effects on the interaction of GLFG repeat-containing hNup98. Functional analysis of Nup98 domains required for nuclear localization demonstrated that the entire ORF was required for efficient incorporation into the nuclear envelope. A putative nuclear localization signal was identified downstream of the GLFG repeat region. Whereas overexpression of both full-length Nup98 and the amino-terminal GLFG repeat region, but not the unique carboxy-terminal region, induced significant suppression of HIV unspliced RNA export, lower levels of exogenous Nup98 expression resulted in a relatively modest increase in unspliced RNA export. These results suggest a physiological role for hNup98 in modulating Rev-dependent RNA export during HIV infection."
7637788,A human nucleoporin-like protein that specifically interacts with HIV Rev.,"The Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) facilitates the nuclear export of unspliced and partly spliced viral RNAs. Rev contains an RNA binding domain, required for interaction with HIV-1 RNA, and an effector domain, required for RNA-bound Rev to function. The Rev effector domain is believed to interact with a cellular cofactor required for the Rev response and thus HIV-1 replication. Here we report the use of a yeast two-hybrid screen to clone human Rev interacting protein (hRIP), which specifically interacts with the Rev effector domain. This hRIP protein has homology with nucleoporins, a class of proteins that mediate nucleocytoplasmic transport. These and other properties of hRIP are those expected of a Rev cellular cofactor."
8943370,A role for nucleoporin FG repeat domains in export of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein and RNA from the nucleus.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein contains a nuclear export signal (NES) that is required for Rev-mediated RNA export in mammals as well as in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Rev NES has been shown to specifically interact with a human (hRIP/RAB1) and a yeast (yRip1p) protein in the two-hybrid assay. Both of these interacting proteins are related to FG nucleoporins on the basis of the presence of typical repeat motifs. This paper shows that Rev is able to interact with multiple FG repeat-containing nucleoporins from both S. cerevisiae and mammals; moreover, the ability of Rev NES mutants to interact with these FG nucleoporins parallels the ability of the mutants to promote RNA export in yeast and mammalian cells. The data also show that, after Xenopus oocyte nuclear injection, several FG nucleoporin repeat domains inhibit the export of both Rev protein and U small nuclear RNAs, suggesting that these nucleoporins participate in Rev-mediated and cellular RNA export. Interestingly, not all FG nucleoporin repeat domains produced the same pattern of RNA export inhibition. The results suggest that Rev and cellular mediators of RNA export can interact with multiple components of the nuclear pore complex during transport, analogous to the proposed mode of action of the nuclear protein import receptor."
12228227,Docking of HIV-1 Vpr to the nuclear envelope is mediated by the interaction with the nucleoporin hCG1.,"The HIV-1 genome contains several genes coding for auxiliary proteins, including the small Vpr protein. Vpr affects the integrity of the nuclear envelope and participates in the nuclear translocation of the preintegration complex containing the viral DNA. Here, we show by photobleaching experiments performed on living cells expressing a Vpr-green fluorescent protein fusion that the protein shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but a significant fraction is concentrated at the nuclear envelope, supporting the hypothesis that Vpr interacts with components of the nuclear pore complex. An interaction between HIV-1 Vpr and the human nucleoporin CG1 (hCG1) was revealed in the yeast two-hybrid system, and then confirmed both in vitro and in transfected cells. This interaction does not involve the FG repeat domain of hCG1 but rather the N-terminal region of the protein. Using a nuclear import assay based on digitonin-permeabilized cells, we demonstrate that hCG1 participates in the docking of Vpr at the nuclear envelope. This association of Vpr with a component of the nuclear pore complex may contribute to the disruption of the nuclear envelope and to the nuclear import of the viral DNA."
9368759,The importin-beta family member Crm1p bridges the interaction between Rev and the nuclear pore complex during nuclear export.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) uses the viral protein Rev to regulate gene expression by promoting the export of unspliced and partially spliced viral transcripts. Rev has been shown to function in a variety of organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The export activity of Rev depends on a nuclear export signal (NES), which is believed to interact either directly or indirectly with the nuclear pore complex to carry out its export function. Crm1p is a member of the importin-beta protein family, other members of which are known to be directly involved in nuclear import. Crm1p has recently been shown to contribute to nuclear export in vertebrate systems. Here, we have studied this mechanism of nuclear to cytoplasmic transport."
9847329,The adeno-associated virus type 2 regulatory proteins rep78 and rep68 interact with the transcriptional coactivator PC4.,"The adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) Rep78/Rep68 regulatory proteins are pleiotropic effectors of viral and cellular DNA replication, of cellular transformation by viral and cellular oncogenes, and of homologous and heterologous gene expression. To search for cellular proteins involved in mediating these functions, we used Rep68 as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system and identified the transcriptional coactivator PC4 as a Rep interaction partner. PC4 has been shown to mediate transcriptional activation by a variety of sequence-specific transcription factors in vitro. Rep amino acids 172 to 530 were sufficient and amino acids 172 to 224 were absolutely necessary for the interaction with PC4. The PC4 domains required for interaction were mapped to the C-terminal single-stranded DNA-binding domain of PC4. In glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, in vitro-transcribed and -translated Rep78 or Rep68 proteins were bound specifically by GST-PC4 fusion proteins. Similarly, PC4 expressed in Escherichia coli was bound by GST-Rep fusion proteins, confirming the direct interaction between Rep and PC4 in vitro. Rep was found to have a higher affinity for the nonphosphorylated, transcriptionally active form of PC4 than for the phosphorylated, transcriptionally inactive form. The latter is predominant in nuclear extracts of HeLa or 293 cells. In the yeast system, but not in vitro, Rep-PC4 interaction was disrupted by a point mutation in the putative nucleotide-binding site of Rep68, suggesting that a stable interaction between Rep and PC4 in vivo is ATP dependent. This mutation has also been shown to impair Rep function in AAV-2 DNA replication and in inhibition of gene expression and inducible DNA amplification. Cytomegalovirus promoter-driven overexpression of PC4 led to transient accumulation of nonphosphorylated PC4 with concomitant downregulation of all three AAV-2 promoters in the absence of helper virus. In the presence of adenovirus, this effect was relieved. These results imply an involvement of the transcriptional coactivator PC4 in the regulation of AAV-2 gene expression in the absence of helper virus."
8676499,Prion protein PrPc interacts with molecular chaperones of the Hsp60 family.,"Prions mediate the pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative diseases, including bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The prion particle consists mainly, if not entirely, of PrPSc, a posttranslationally modified isoform of the cellular host-encoded prion protein (PrPc). It has been suggested that additional cellular factors might be involved in the physiological function of PrPc and in the propagation of PrPSc. Here we employ a Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid screen to search for proteins which interact specifically with the Syrian golden hamster prion protein. Screening of a HeLa cDNA library identified heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), a cellular chaperone as a major interactor for PrPc. The specificity of the interaction was confirmed in vitro for the recombinant proteins PrPc23-231 and rPrP27-30 fused to glutathione S-transferase with recombinant human Hsp60 as well as the bacterial GroEL. The interaction site for recombinant Hsp60 and GroEL proteins was mapped between amino acids 180 and 210 of the prion protein by screening with a set of recombinant PrPc fragments. The binding of Hsp60 and GroEL occurs within a region which contains parts of the putative alpha-helical domains H3 and H4 of the prion protein."
12745083,"The viral death protein Apoptin interacts with Hippi, the protein interactor of Huntingtin-interacting protein 1.","Apoptin, a chicken anemia virus-encoded protein, induces apoptosis in human tumor cells but not in normal cells. The tumor-specific activity of Apoptin is correlated with its nuclear localization in tumor cells. In an attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Apoptin-induced apoptosis, we identified human Hippi, the protein interactor and apoptosis co-mediator of Huntingtin interacting protein 1, as one of the Apoptin-associated proteins by yeast two-hybrid screen. We also demonstrated that Hippi could interact with Apoptin both in vitro and in human cells. Furthermore, subcellular localization studies showed that Hippi and Apoptin perfectly colocalized in the cytoplasm of normal human HEL cells, whereas in cancerous HeLa cells most Apoptin and Hippi were located separately in the nucleus and cytoplasm and, thus, showed only a modest colocalization. Mapping studies indicate that Hippi binds within the self-multimerization domain of Apoptin, and Apoptin binds to the C-terminal half of Hippi, including its death effector domain-like motif. Our results suggest that the Apoptin-Hippi interaction may play a role in the suppression of apoptosis in normal cells."
15507209,Requirement of DDX3 DEAD box RNA helicase for HIV-1 Rev-RRE export function.,"A single transcript in its unspliced and spliced forms directs the synthesis of all HIV-1 proteins. Although nuclear export of intron-containing cellular transcripts is restricted in mammalian cells, HIV-1 has evolved the viral Rev protein to overcome this restriction for viral transcripts. Previously, CRM1 was identified as a cellular cofactor for Rev-dependent export of intron-containing HIV-1 RNA. Here, we present evidence that Rev/CRM1 activity utilizes the ATP-dependent DEAD box RNA helicase, DDX3. We show that DDX3 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, which binds CRM1 and localizes to nuclear membrane pores. Knockdown of DDX3 using either antisense vector or dominant-negative mutants suppressed Rev-RRE-function in the export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 RNAs. Plausibly, DDX3 is the human RNA helicase which functions in the CRM1 RNA export pathway analogously to the postulated role for Dbp5p in yeast mRNA export."
14645565,Barrier-to-autointegration factor BAF binds p55 Gag and matrix and is a host component of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virions.,"Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) is a conserved human chromatin protein exploited by retroviruses. Previous investigators showed that BAF binds double-stranded DNA nonspecifically and is a host component of preintegration complexes (PICs) isolated from cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or Moloney murine leukemia virus. BAF protects PIC structure and stimulates the integration of salt-stripped PICs into target DNA in vitro. PICs are thought to acquire BAF from the cytoplasm during infection. However, we identified two human tissues (of 16 tested) in which BAF mRNA was not detected: thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes, which are enriched in CD4(+) T lymphocytes and macrophage precursors, respectively. BAF protein was detected in activated but not resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes; thus, if BAF were essential for PIC function, we hypothesized that virions might ""bring their own BAF."" Supporting this model, BAF copurified with HIV-1 virions that were digested with subtilisin to remove microvesicle contaminants, and BAF was present in approximately zero to three copies per virion. In three independent assays, BAF bound directly to both p55 Gag (the structural precursor of HIV-1 virions) and its cleaved product, matrix. Using lysates from cells overexpressing Gag, endogenous BAF and Gag were coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies against Gag. Purified recombinant BAF had low micromolar affinities (1.1 to 1.4 micro M) for recombinant Gag and matrix. We conclude that BAF is present at low levels in incoming virions, in addition to being acquired from the cytoplasm of newly infected cells. We further conclude that BAF might contribute to the assembly or activity of HIV-1 PICs through direct binding to matrix, as well as DNA."
11780123,Identification of a host protein essential for assembly of immature HIV-1 capsids.,"To form an immature HIV-1 capsid, 1,500 HIV-1 Gag (p55) polypeptides must assemble properly along the host cell plasma membrane. Insect cells and many higher eukaryotic cell types support efficient capsid assembly, but yeast and murine cells do not, indicating that host machinery is required for immature HIV-1 capsid formation. Additionally, in a cell-free system that reconstitutes HIV-1 capsid formation, post-translational assembly events require ATP and a subcellular fraction, suggesting a requirement for a cellular ATP-binding protein. Here we identify such a protein (HP68), described previously as an RNase L inhibitor, and demonstrate that it associates post-translationally with HIV-1 Gag in a cell-free system and human T cells infected with HIV-1. Using a dominant negative mutant of HP68 in mammalian cells and depletion-reconstitution experiments in the cell-free system, we demonstrate that HP68 is essential for post-translational events in immature HIV-1 capsid assembly. Furthermore, in cells the HP68-Gag complex is associated with HIV-1 Vif, which is involved in virion morphogenesis and infectivity. These findings support a critical role for HP68 in post-translational events of HIV-1 assembly and reveal a previously unappreciated dimension of host-viral interaction."
1541298,Human-immunodeficiency-virus-type-1-encoded Vpu protein is phosphorylated by casein kinase II.,"Vpu as a human-immunodeficiency-virus-type-1-encoded 81-amino-acid integral-membrane protein was expressed in Escherichia coli using the inducible ptrc promoter of an ATG fusion vector. Recombinant Vpu is associated with membranes of E. coli and could be partially solubilized by detergents. Recombinant Vpu was phosphorylated in vitro with purified porcine casein kinase II (CKII) as well as with a CKII-related protein kinase found in cytoplasmic extracts of human and hamster cells. Recombinant Vpu associated with E. coli membranes has turned out to be the best substrate for in vitro phosphorylation with CKII. This reaction can be inhibited by heparin and the ATP analogue 5,6-dichloro-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)benzimidazole (DRB), both known to be potent inhibitors of CKII. Radiolabelled gamma ATP and gamma GTP were used as phosphate donors in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant Vpu. In vivo phosphorylation of Vpu in HIV-1-infected H9 cells was also inhibited by DRB. We concluded therefrom that the Vpu protein is phosphorylated by the ubiquitous CKII in HIV-1-infected human host cells. Two seryl residues in the sequence of Vpu (position 52 and 56) correspond to the consensus S/TXXD/E for CKII. These potential phosphorylation sites are located within a well-conserved dodecapeptide of Vpu (residues 47-58), which is found in different HIV-1 strains as well as in a Vpu-like protein of SIVCPZ. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against two different epitopes of Vpu were used for immunoprecipitation of Vpu from HIV-1-infected cells and for detection of Vpu in Western blot analyses. Vpu from HIV-1-infected cells as well as recombinant Vpu expressed in E. coli were determined by SDS/PAGE using 6 M urea to be 9 kDa, which corresponds to the calculated molecular mass of Vpu."
7778293,Degradation of CD4 induced by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein: a predicted alpha-helix structure in the proximal cytoplasmic region of CD4 contributes to Vpu sensitivity.,"The HIV-1-encoded Vpu protein induces a rapid and specific degradation of CD4 molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this study, Vpu-induced degradation of CD4 in the ER was investigated by quantitative immunoprecipitation of CD4 following cotransfection of COS-7 cells with CD4 and Vpu expressors in the presence of brefeldin A, a drug that blocks protein transport from the ER to the Golgi complex. In order to precisely define the sequence(s) or structural element(s) in the CD4 cytoplasmic domain necessary for Vpu-induced degradation, a panel of deletion and substitution mutants in the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 was generated and analyzed. In agreement with previous reports, our deletion analysis indicates that a region encompassing amino acids 411 to 419 (KRLLSEKKT) in the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 was required to confer Vpu sensitivity. However, six specific substitution mutations within this region did not confer CD4 resistance to Vpu, suggesting that neither the amino acid sequence nor the charge of the amino acids in this region was critical to Vpu-induced CD4 degradation. A dileucine motif that is important for internalization of CD4 and Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation was also not required for Vpu-induced CD4 degradation. Interestingly, two substitution mutants (CD4EMKL and CD4MK407,11PP) located in a more proximal cytoplasmic region of CD4 abolished Vpu-induced CD4 degradation. Computer-assisted analysis of the substitution and deletion mutants conferring CD4 resistance to Vpu-induced degradation indicated that these mutations disrupted a putative alpha-helix formed in the proximal cytoplasmic region of CD4. Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that a structural element in the proximal cytoplasmic region of CD4 contributes to Vpu sensitivity."
9151836,Putative alpha-helical structures in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein and CD4 are involved in binding and degradation of the CD4 molecule.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vpu gene encodes a 16-kDa class I integral membrane phosphoprotein with an N-terminal membrane-spanning region and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. In the cytoplasmic domain, two amphipathic alpha-helices joined by a flexible turn containing two phosphoacceptor sites have been predicted. Previous studies have shown that Vpu downregulates CD4 molecules by inducing their specific degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Phosphorylation of serine residues 52 and 56, present within the cytoplasmic domain of the Vpu protein, has been shown to be essential to this Vpu function. However, the contribution of these two phosphoacceptor sites in the mechanism of CD4 degradation remains undefined. Interestingly, a specific interaction between Vpu and CD4 was recently demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Binding of Vpu was shown to be necessary but not sufficient to mediate CD4 degradation, indicating that interaction between Vpu and CD4 represents an early step critical in triggering a process leading to CD4 degradation. To delineate the sequence(s) and/or structural determinant(s) involved in this Vpu-CD4 interaction and in the Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation, we performed a mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 and Vpu. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal that disruption of the putative alpha-helical structure in the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of CD4 affects the binding to Vpu, suggesting that this structure may act as an interface for the CD4-Vpu interaction that mediates CD4 degradation. Vpu proteins containing mutations in either or both of the phosphoacceptor sites (Ser52 or/and Ser56) were inactive in regard to CD4 degradation yet retained the capacity to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of CD4. In an attempt to define the minimal region responsible for this interaction, we tested a panel of mutations which were designed to affect the integrity of the putative alpha-helices present in the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu. Our results indicate that although both C-terminal alpha-helices are required for degradation of CD4, only alpha-helix I, located in the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region of Vpu, is involved in the interaction between Vpu and CD4. Taken together, these results demonstrate that alpha-helical structures in the HIV-1 Vpu and CD4 proteins are involved in binding and degradation of CD4 molecules."
8057425,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev is required in vivo for binding of poly(A)-binding protein to Rev-dependent RNAs.,"In the absence of Rev or the Rev-responsive element, the Rev-dependent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNAs do not behave as mRNAs; rather, they exhibit nuclear defects in splicing and/or nuclear export and cytoplasmic defects in stability and translation. A translational initiation factor, eIF-5A, has recently been shown to bind specifically to the Rev activation domain. As the binding of poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PAB1) to the poly(A) tail of mRNAs is involved in both the stability and translation of cytoplasmic mRNAs, we investigated whether Rev might influence the association of PAB1 with cytoplasmic HIV-1 RNAs. Antibodies were generated against PAB1. We used these antibodies in an immunoprecipitation assay to detect specific binding of PAB1 to cytoplasmic mRNAs. We found that in the presence of Rev, PAB1 was associated with Rev-dependent and Rev-independent RNAs in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. However, in the absence of functional Rev, we found little or no PAB1 associated with Rev-dependent RNAs. These RNAs were capable of binding PAB1 in vitro. These results demonstrate that HIV-1 RNAs are defective in PAB1 association in the absence of Rev."
2737204,Chemical characterization of p17gag from human immunodeficiency virus as an N-terminally myristoylated protein.,"The N-terminal p17gag protein of the human immunodeficiency virus has been shown to incorporate radioactivity following labelling of infected cell lines with [3H]myristic acid. We investigated p17gag to determine whether the incorporated radioactivity was the consequence of N-terminal myristoylation. The virus was purified by density gradient centrifugation after labelling chronically infected H9 cells with [3H]myristic acid. The p17gag was isolated by immunoprecipitation and subjected to partial acid hydrolysis. [3H]Myristoylglycine generated by the hydrolysis was derivatized to 4-(p-nitrobenzylidene)-2-tridecanoyloxazol-5-one and identified against a co-eluting, derivatized, unlabelled N-myristoylglycine standard by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. This study unequivocally demonstrates that p17gag is an N-myristoylated protein."
9303539,"Binding specificity and in vivo targets of the EH domain, a novel protein-protein interaction module.","EH is a recently identified protein-protein interaction domain found in the signal transducers Eps15 and Eps15R and several other proteins of yeast nematode. We show that EH domains from Eps15 and Eps15R bind in vitro to peptides containing an asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) motif. Direct screening of expression libraries with EH domains yielded a number of putative EH interactors, all of which possessed NPF motifs that were shown to be responsible for the interaction. Among these interactors were the human homolog of NUMB, a developmentally reguated gene of Drosophila, and RAB, the cellular cofactor of the HIV REV protein. We demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation of Eps15 with NUMB and RAB. Finally, in vitro binding of NPF-containing peptides to cellular proteins and EST database screening established the existence of a family of EH-containing proteins in mammals. Based on the characteristics of EH-containing and EH-binding proteins, we propose that EH domains are involved in processes connected with the transport and sorting of molecules within the cell."
7794538,Unidirectional budding of HIV-1 at the site of cell-to-cell contact is associated with co-polarization of intercellular adhesion molecules and HIV-1 viral matrix protein.,To explore the possibility that HIV-1 budding and cellular adhesion molecules co-polarize at cell-to-cell contact sites. To investigate the incorporation of host-cell-derived adhesion molecules into HIV-1.
9837918,The specificity of the CRM1-Rev nuclear export signal interaction is mediated by RanGTP.,"Nuclear export of intron-containing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA is mediated by the viral Rev protein that contains both an RNA binding domain specific for the viral Rev response element (RRE) and a nuclear export signal (NES). The cellular CRM1 (Exportin1) protein functions as a nuclear export receptor for proteins carrying a Rev-like NES in a process that also requires the GTP bound form of the Ran GTPase. Using purified recombinant factors, we show by co-precipitation, gel mobility shift and protein footprinting assays that full-length Rev protein interacts directly with CRM1 in vitro independently of both the integrity of the characteristic leucine residues of the NES and the presence of the cytotoxin leptomycin B (LMB). Addition of RanGTP induces the formation of an RRE-Rev-CRM1-RanGTP complex that is sensitive to LMB, NES mutations, and Ran being charged with GTP. Within this complex, CRM1 is readily cross-linked to Cys89 near the NES of Rev. By protein footprinting, we demonstrate that the NES of Rev and two regions in CRM1 become inaccessible to endoproteinases upon binding suggesting that these regions are involved in protein-protein interactions. Our data are consistent with a model in which CRM1 is the nuclear export receptor for the Rev-RRE ribonucleoprotein complex and that RanGTP binds to a preformed Rev-CRM1 complex and specifies a functional interaction with the NES."
12015151,Structures of two streptococcal superantigens bound to TCR beta chains reveal diversity in the architecture of T cell signaling complexes.,"Superantigens (SAGs) crosslink MHC class II and TCR molecules, resulting in an overstimulation of T cells associated with human disease. SAGs interact with several different surfaces on MHC molecules, necessitating the formation of multiple distinct MHC-SAG-TCR ternary signaling complexes. Variability in SAG-TCR binding modes could also contribute to the structural heterogeneity of SAG-dependent signaling complexes. We report crystal structures of the streptococcal SAGs SpeA and SpeC in complex with their corresponding TCR beta chain ligands that reveal distinct TCR binding modes. The SpeC-TCR beta chain complex structure, coupled with the recently determined SpeC-HLA-DR2a complex structure, provides a model for a novel T cell signaling complex that precludes direct TCR-MHC interactions. Thus, highly efficient T cell activation may be achieved through structurally diverse strategies of TCR ligation."
12467569,Crystal structure of a SEA variant in complex with MHC class II reveals the ability of SEA to crosslink MHC molecules.,"Although the biological properties of staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) have been well characterized, structural insights into the interaction between SEA and major histocompatibilty complex (MHC) class II have only been obtained by modeling. Here, the crystal structure of the D227A variant of SEA in complex with human MHC class II has been determined by X-ray crystallography. SEA(D227A) exclusively binds with its N-terminal domain to the alpha chain of HLA-DR1. The ability of one SEA molecule to crosslink two MHC molecules was modeled. It shows that this SEA molecule cannot interact with the T cell receptor (TCR) while a second SEA molecule interacts with MHC. Because of its relatively low toxicity, the D227A variant of SEA is used in tumor therapy."
10381392,Nuclear pore localization and nucleocytoplasmic transport of eIF-5A: evidence for direct interaction with the export receptor CRM1.,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) is the only cellular protein known to contain the unusual amino acid hypusine. The exact in vivo function of eIF-5A, however, is to date unknown. The finding that eIF-5A is an essential cofactor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev RNA transport factor suggested that eIF-5A is part of a specific nuclear export pathway. In this study we used indirect immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy to demonstrate that eIF-5A accumulates at nuclear pore-associated intranuclear filaments in mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes. We are able to show that eIF-5A interacts with the general nuclear export receptor, CRM1. Furthermore, microinjection studies in somatic cells revealed that eIF-5A is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and that this nuclear export is blocked by leptomycin B. Our data demonstrate that eIF-5A is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein."
12932580,The pH dependence of HIV-1 capsid assembly and its interaction with cyclophilin A.,"Immature HIV-1 virions have spherical cores which become conical due to cleavage of the capsid domain of Gag. Here, we have used an immature form of capsid and show by electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and single angle light scattering that it aggregates to spherical cores resembling immature virions at high ionic strengths and at pH values above 6. Dynamic angle light scattering of the dissociated protein shows structural changes that promote oligomerization above pH 6. We then examined the role of the required host protein cyclophilin A on assembly. Cyclophilin A is incorporated into virions at a 1:10 cyclophilin A/capsid ratio. We find that although cyclophilin A does not affect the oligomerization rate or stability of immature capsid cores, it does bind strongly to immature capsid at physiological stoichiometry above pH 6. This association serves as an entry route of cyclophilin A into HIV-1 virions."
2194551,Myristoylation of gag proteins of HIV-1 plays an important role in virus assembly.,"The gag proteins of HIV-1 are modified by the addition of myristic acid to the amino terminal glycine residue. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct a mutant of HIV-1 in which this glycine residue was changed to an alanine. Upon transfection into cos-1 cells, the mutant genome directed the synthesis of the full complement of HIV-1 proteins, but p17 and p17-containing polyproteins were not myristoylated. The cells transfected with the mutant DNA did not release any virus particles and no viral cores were visible by electron microscopy. Furthermore, supernatant from these transfected cells failed to infect CEM cells. The expression and function of gp120 on the surface of cells transfected with the mutant DNA was unaffected as these cells formed syncytia comparable in both size and number to the ones obtained with wild-type DNA."
11054265,Calmodulin and HIV type 1: interactions with Gag and Gag products.,"The level of calmodulin increases in cells expressing HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. Although a calmodulin increase is bound to alter many cellular metabolic and signaling pathways, the benefits to the virus of these alterations must be indirect. However, the possibility exists that increased cellular calmodulin benefits the virus by directly associating with nonenvelope viral proteins. We have, therefore, investigated whether calmodulin can interact with HIV structural proteins Gag, p17, and p24. Calmodulin binds Gag and p17 but not p24 in (125)I-labeled calmodulin overlays of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Removal of calcium by addition of EGTA eliminates this binding. A computer algorithm for predicting helical regions that should bind calmodulin predicts that there are two calmodulin-binding regions near the N terminus of p17. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorimetry shows that two peptides, each of which includes one of the predicted regions, bind calmodulin: p17(11-25) binds calmodulin with a 2-to-1 stoichiometry and dissociation constant of approximately 10(-9) M(2), and p17(31-46) also binds calmodulin with a dissociation constant of about 10(-9) M. These binding sites are nearly contiguous, forming an extended calmodulin-binding domain p17(11-46). In H-9 cells, Gag and calmodulin colocalize within the resolution of confocal light microscopy."
9151826,The Nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhances serine phosphorylation of the viral matrix.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 matrix (MA) protein is phosphorylated during virion maturation on its C-terminal tyrosine and on several serine residues. Whereas MA tyrosine phosphorylation facilitates viral nuclear import, the significance of MA serine phosphorylation remains unclear. Here, we report that MA serine but not tyrosine phosphorylation is strongly enhanced by Nef. Mutations that abrogated the membrane association of Nef and its ability to bind a cellular serine/threonine kinase greatly diminished the extent of virion MA serine phosphorylation. Correspondingly, a protein kinase coimmunoprecipitated with Nef could phosphorylate MA on serine in vitro, producing a phosphopeptide pattern reminiscent of that of virion MA. Recombinant p21-activated kinase hPAK65, a recently proposed relative of the Nef-associated kinase, achieved a comparable result. Taken together, these data suggest that MA is a target of the Nef-associated serine kinase."
8806671,Phosphorylation of HIV-1 Rev protein: implication of protein kinase CK2 and pro-directed kinases.,"HIV-1 Rev transactivator is readily phosphorylated at separate regions by protein kinase CK2 and MAP kinase. Protein kinase CK1 cannot replace CK2 as phosphorylating agent and cdc2 only slowly phosphorylates Rev at one of the two sites affected by MAP kinase. Mutational analysis shows that Ser-8 and, to a lesser extent, Ser-5 are phosphorylated by CK2. In contrast, a mutation (R14TV-->EED) which suppresses Rev activity dramatically enhances Rev phosphorylation either in vitro by CK2 or in vivo, suggesting that phosphorylation by CK2 could play a role in Rev down-regulation."
9341215,Site-specific phosphorylation of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 Rev protein accelerates formation of an efficient RNA-binding conformation.,"Phosphorylation is important in the regulation of many cellular processes, yet the precise role of protein phosphorylation for many RNA-binding protein substrates remains obscure. In this report, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of a recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type-1 Rev protein promotes rapid formation of an efficient RNA-binding state. The apparent dissociation constant for ligand binding is enhanced 7-fold for the protein following phosphorylation; however, phosphate addition leads to a 1. 6-fold decrease in RNA ligand-protein complex stability. RNA ligand binding stimulates slow formation of an equally competent binding state for the unphosphorylated protein, indicating that the addition of phosphate or ligand binding promotes a similar conformational change in Rev. Phosphorylation directly alters the conformation of Rev, as revealed by modification experiments that monitor the solvent accessibility of cysteines in the protein. These biochemical properties are attributed to the addition of phosphate at one of two serine residues (Ser-54 or Ser-56) that lie within the multimerization domain adjacent to the RNA-binding helix. Glutaraldehyde-mediated cross-linking experiments revealed that phosphorylation of Rev does not affect Rev multimerization activity. The Rev protein from the less pathogenic HIV-2 isolate lacks this phosphorylation site in the amino acid sequence; thus, the described biochemical properties of the phosphorylated protein may contribute to Rev activity and possibly to HIV-1 virulence during natural infection."
10026140,Maturation-induced conformational changes of HIV-1 capsid protein and identification of two high affinity sites for cyclophilins in the C-terminal domain.,"Viral incorporation of cyclophilin A (CyPA) during the assembly of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is crucial for efficient viral replication. CyPA binds to the previously identified Gly-Pro90 site of the capsid protein p24, but its role remained unclear. Here we report two new interaction sites between cyclophilins and p24. Both are located in the C-terminal domain of p24 around Gly-Pro157 and Gly-Pro224. Peptides corresponding to these regions showed higher affinities (Kd approximately 0.3 microM) for both CyPA and cyclophilin B than the best peptide derived from the Gly-Pro90 site ( approximately 8 microM) and thus revealed new sequence motifs flanking Gly-Pro that are important for tight interaction of peptide ligands with cyclophilins. Between CyPA and an immature (unprocessed) form of p24, a Kd of approximately 8 microM was measured, which corresponded with the Kd of the best of the Gly-Pro90 peptides, indicating an association via this site. Processing of immature p24 by the viral protease, yielding mature p24, elicited a conformational change in its C-terminal domain that was signaled by the covalently attached fluorescence label acrylodan. Consequently, CyPA and cyclophilin B bound with much higher affinities ( approximately 0.6 and 0.25 microM) to the new, i.e. maturation-generated sites. Since this domain is essential for p24 oligomerization and capsid cone formation, CyPA bound to the new sites might impair the regularity of the capsid cone and thus facilitate in vivo core disassembly after host infection."
2109912,Functional domains of the HIV-1 rev gene required for trans-regulation and subcellular localization.,"The rev gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a 116 amino acid nuclear regulatory protein (Rev) that increases the cytoplasmic expression of viral mRNAs containing the Rev response element (RRE) and coding for the structural proteins, Gag and Env. To identify the functional domains of Rev, amino acid deletion and chain termination mutations were introduced in the Rev coding region. The ability of these mutants to increase the cytoplasmic expression of a Rev-test plasmid (pSV-AR), containing the RRE cloned into the 3' noncoding region of the CAT gene in plasmid pSV2CAT, was examined in transient expression assays in HeLa cells. Our results indicate that three distinct regions mapping within the N-terminal 98 amino acids of Rev are essential for its activity. The subcellular localization of the various Rev proteins was examined in COS cells by indirect immunofluorescence. Rev was found to localize predominantly in the nucleolus of transfected cells. All mutant Rev proteins, with the exception of a deletion mutant (rev delta 41-44) lacking four Arg residues of a highly basic domain, were found to localize in the nucleolus. Mutant rev delta 41-44 exhibited weak diffuse fluorescence in the nucleus with a tendency to accumulate in the cytoplasm. A 15 amino acid region encompassing this basic domain (38-52) when fused to the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene efficiently directed the fusion gene product to the nucleus and nucleolus, suggesting a role for this domain in the nucleolar localization of Rev."
10708443,Evidence for budding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 selectively from glycolipid-enriched membrane lipid rafts.,"A number of recent studies have demonstrated the significance of detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-enriched membrane domains or lipid rafts, especially in regard to activation and signaling in T lymphocytes. These domains can be viewed as floating rafts composed of sphingolipids and cholesterol which sequester glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins, such as Thy-1 and CD59. CD45, a 200-kDa transmembrane phosphatase protein, is excluded from these domains. We have found that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles produced by infected T-cell lines acquire the GPI-linked proteins Thy-1 and CD59, as well as the ganglioside GM1, which is known to partition preferentially into lipid rafts. In contrast, despite its high expression on the cell surface, CD45 was poorly incorporated into virus particles. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that HIV-1 proteins colocalized with Thy-1, CD59, GM1, and a lipid raft-specific fluorescent lipid, DiIC(16)(3), in uropods of infected Jurkat cells. CD45 did not colocalize with HIV-1 proteins and was excluded from uropods. Dot immunoassay of Triton X-100-extracted membrane fractions revealed that HIV-1 p17 matrix protein and gp41 were present in the detergent-resistant fractions and that [(3)H]myristic acid-labeled HIV Gag showed a nine-to-one enrichment in lipid rafts. We propose a model for the budding of HIV virions through lipid rafts whereby host cell cholesterol, sphingolipids, and GPI-linked proteins within these domains are incorporated into the viral envelope, perhaps as a result of preferential sorting of HIV Gag to lipid rafts."
11379967,Application of a green fluorescent fusion protein to study protein-protein interactions by electrophoretic methods.,"A screening procedure for protein-protein interactions in cellular extracts using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) was established. GFP was fused as a fluorescent indicator to the C-terminus of a cyclophilin (rDmCyp20) from Drosophila melanogaster. Cyclophilins (Cyps) belong to the ubiquitously distributed enzyme family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPlases) and are well known as cellular targets of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). The PPlase activity of the GFP fused rDmCyp20 as well as the high affinity to CsA remain intact. Using native gel electrophoresis and ACE mobility-shift assays, it was demonstrated that the known moderate affinity of Cyp20 to the capsid protein p24 of HIV-1 was detectable in the case of rDmCyp20 fused to the fluorescent tag. For the p24 / rDmCyp20-GFP binding an ACE method was established which allowed to determine a dissociation constant of Kd = 20+/-1.5 x 10(-6) M. This result was verified by size-exclusion chromatography and is in good agreement with published data for the nonfused protein. Moreover the fusion protein was utilized to screen rDmCyp20-protein interactions by capillary electrophoresis in biological matrices. A putative ligand of rDmCyp20 in crude extracts of embryonic D. melanogaster was discovered by mobility-shift assays using native gel electrophoresis with fluorescence imaging and ACE with laser-induced fluorescence detection. The approach seems applicable to a wide range of proteins and offers new opportunities to screen for moderate protein-protein interactions in biological samples."
12614157,Inhibition of nuclear import mediated by the Rev-arginine rich motif by RNA molecules.,"The HIV-1 Rev protein plays a pivotal role in viral replication, and therefore, inhibition of its function should block the progression of the virus-induced immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Here, RNA molecules have been shown to inhibit import of the HIV-1 Rev protein into nuclei of permeabilized cells. Nuclear uptake of biotinylated recombinant His-tagged Rev-GFP was assessed in nuclear extracts from digitonin-permeabilized cells by binding to either importin beta-receptors or nickel molecules immobilized on a microtiter plate. Using this method together with fluorescence microscopy, we determined that nuclear import of Rev is inhibited by the addition of a reticulocyte lysate which routinely is used as a source of nuclear import receptors. This inhibition was released by treatment with the RNase enzyme. Also t-RNA molecules and the oligoribonucleotide RRE IIB, namely, the second stem structure of the Rev responsive element (RRE) of the viral RNA, inhibit Rev nuclear import. Similar results were obtained when BSA molecules with covalently attached Rev-arginine rich motif (ARM) peptides were used as a nuclear transport substrate, indicating that the nuclear import inhibition of the Rev protein is due to the presence of the ARM domain. Binding experiments revealed that the RNA molecules inhibit the interaction between the ARM region and importin beta, implying that the RNA prevents the formation of the import complex. The implication of our results for the regulation of the nuclear import of Rev as well as for the use of RNA molecules as antiviral drugs is discussed."
10792467,Rev-dependent association of the intron-containing HIV-1 gag mRNA with the nuclear actin bundles and the inhibition of its nucleocytoplasmic transport by latrunculin-B.,"A hallmark of HIV-1 gene expression is that unspliced genomic RNA, which also acts as mRNA for the expression of Gag/Pol, is exported to the cytoplasm. Rev directs this transport through the nuclear export signal (NES)."
9150887,A role for Rev in the association of HIV-1 gag mRNA with cytoskeletal beta-actin and viral protein expression.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) Rev acts by inducing the specific nucleocytoplasmic transport of a class of incompletely spliced RNAs that encodes the viral structural proteins. The transfection of HeLa cells with a rev-defective HIV-1 expression plasmid, however, resulted in the export of overexpressed, intron-containing species of viral RNAs, possibly through a default process of nuclear retention. Thus, this system enabled us to directly compare Rev+ and Rev+ cells as to the usage of RRE-containing mRNAs by the cellular translational machinery. Biochemical examination of the transfected cells revealed that although significant levels of gag and env mRNAs were detected in both the presence and absence of Rev, efficient production of viral proteins was strictly dependent on the presence of Rev. A fluorescence in situ hybridisation assay confirmed these findings and provided further evidence that even in the presence of Rev, not all of the viral mRNA was equally translated. At the early phase of RNA export in Rev+ cells, gag mRNA was observed throughout both the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm as uniform fine stippling. In addition, the mRNA formed clusters mainly in the perinuclear region, which were not observed in Rev+ cells. In the presence of Rev, expression of the gag protein was limited to these perinuclear sites where the mRNA accumulated. Subsequent staining of the cytoskeletal proteins demonstrated that in Rev+ cells gag mRNA is colocalized with beta-actin in the sites where the RNA formed clusters. In the absence of Rev, in contrast, the gag mRNA failed to associate with the cytoskeletal proteins. These results suggest that in addition to promoting the emergence of intron-containing RNA from the nucleus, Rev plays an important role in the compartmentation of translation by directing RRE-containing mRNAs to the beta-actin to form the perinuclear clusters at which the synthesis of viral structural proteins begins."
11932418,"Expression of exogenous Sam68, the 68-kilodalton SRC-associated protein in mitosis, is able to alleviate impaired Rev function in astrocytes.","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression in astrocytes is restricted, resulting in a brief and limited synthesis of HIV-1 viral structural proteins. Impaired Rev function has been documented in these cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the impaired Rev function are not fully understood. Using the astroglial cell line U87.MG as a model, we report here that HIV-1 gene expression down-regulated expression of Sam68, the 68-kDa Src-associated protein in mitosis, which was constitutively expressed at a lower level in astrocytes. Elevating the endogenous level of Sam68 expression considerably restored HIV-1 Rev function in astrocytes, as determined by a Rev-dependent reporter gene assay. However, elevation of Sam68 expression achieved only a modest increase in HIV-1 production, further supporting the notion that there are multiple cellular restrictions of HIV-1 gene expression in astrocytes. Mutagenesis analysis identified the region between amino acids 321 and 410 of Sam68 as being directly involved in the binding of Sam68 to Rev, while a double mutation in Rev, L78D and E79L, like those in the dominant-negative Rev mutant M10, eliminated Rev binding to Sam68. Moreover, subcellular fractionation and digital fluorescence microscopic imaging revealed that Sam68 expression promoted Rev nuclear export. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that a lower level of constitutive Sam68 expression, followed by further down-regulation by HIV-1 infection, contributes to impaired Rev function in astrocytes, and they suggest that Sam68 may play an important role in Rev nuclear export."
12134041,"Direct participation of Sam68, the 68-kilodalton Src-associated protein in mitosis, in the CRM1-mediated Rev nuclear export pathway.","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication requires efficient nuclear export of incompletely spliced and unspliced HIV-1 mRNA transcripts, which is achieved by Rev expression at an early stage of the viral life cycle. We have recently shown that expression of Sam68, the 68-kDa Src-associated protein in mitosis, is able to alleviate Rev function block in astrocytes by promoting Rev nuclear export. In the present study, we utilized an antisense RNA expression strategy to down-modulate constitutive Sam68 expression and examined its effect on Rev function, HIV-1 gene expression, and viral replication. These results showed that down-modulation of constitutive Sam68 expression markedly inhibited HIV-1 production in 293T cells and viral replication in T lymphocytes such as Jurkat and CEM cells, as well as human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Rev-dependent in trans complementation and reporter gene assays further demonstrated that inhibition of HIV-1 gene expression by Sam68 down-modulation was due to impeded Rev activity. Moreover, digital fluorescence microscopic imaging revealed that down-modulation of Sam68 expression caused exclusive nuclear retention and colocalization of both Rev and CRM1. Taken together, these data suggest that adequate Sam68 expression is required for Rev function and, thereby, for HIV-1 gene expression and viral replication, and they support the notion that Sam68 is directly involved in the CRM1-mediated Rev nuclear export pathway."
8548340,Functional analysis of the phosphorylation sites on the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-encoded vpu product is a small class 1 integral membrane protein that is phosphorylated by the ubiquitous casein kinase II (CKII) in HIV-1-infected cells. The Vpu protein facilitates the release of budding virions from the surface of infected cells and delays the rate of syncytium formation. In this study, we investigated the role of phosphorylation in the biological activity of Vpu. Our results show that phosphorylation of Vpu occurs on serine residues at positions 52 and 56 located in a highly conserved dodecapeptide sequence. Mutation of either Ser 56, or both Ser 52 and Ser 56 impaired the ability of Vpu to delay the rate of syncytium formation while retaining virion release activity at levels comparable to vpu+ proviruses. Flow cytometry analysis indicates that the relative amounts of envelope glycoprotein gp120 expressed at the surface of cells transfected with these vpu mutant proviruses was two- to threefold greater than that observed on cells transfected with a vpu+ provirus. This increased expression of gp120 at the cell surface may explain the more rapid onset of syncytium formation observed in cell transfected with vpu mutant proviruses. These results suggest that Vpu-facilitated virion release and delayed cytopathic effect are the consequence of two distinct functional activities of the protein."
8709227,"CD4 down-modulation during infection of human T cells with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 involves independent activities of vpu, env, and nef.","The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genes vpu, env, and nef have all been implicated in modulating the levels of cell surface CD4 on infected cells. To quantitatively assess the relative contribution of each gene product to the regulation of CD4 during HIV infection of Jurkat T cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we have developed an infectious HIV reporter system which expresses different combinations of these genes. To distinguish infected cells in the early or late stages of infection from uninfected cells, these viruses were designed to express human placental alkaline phosphatase with the kinetics of either early or late viral genes. Flow cytometry to detect placental alkaline phosphatase and CD4 in infected cells showed that vpu, env, and nef are independently capable of down-modulation of CD4. As predicted by their respective expression patterns, nef down-modulated CD4 rapidly during the early phase of virus infection whereas vpu and env functioned late in the infection. In both Jurkat cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a combination of the three genes was more efficient than any one or two genes, demonstrating that all three genes are required to achieve maximal CD4 down-modulation. In primary cells, down-modulation of CD4 was less efficient than in Jurkat cells and there was a stronger dependence on nef function for reducing cell surface CD4. HIV therefore has three genes that are able to independently down-modulate CD4; together, they can eliminate the bulk of cell surface CD4."
8887470,Bimodal down-regulation of CD4 in cells expressing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu and Env.,"We analysed clones of HeLa cells stably expressing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope gene (env) and the HIV-1 receptor, CD4. Surprisingly, individual clones were found to consist of two distinct populations of cells differing by about 10-fold in the level of surface CD4. When high and low CD4-expressing cells were separated by FACS, each subpopulation gave rise to a mixture of high and low CD4-expressing cells after several days in culture. High and low CD4-expressing subpopulations did not differ with respect to the amount of intracellular Env, but there was an inverse correlation between CD4 and another HIV-1 protein encoded by the same segment of the HIV genome, Vpu. High surface CD4 cells had high levels of intracellular CD4, largely in the perinuclear region, and low levels of Vpu with a diffuse staining pattern. Conversely, low surface CD4 cells had low levels of intracellular CD4 with a diffuse staining pattern, and high levels of Vpu, largely in the perinuclear region. Vectors containing mutant versions of either Env or Vpu failed to down-regulate surface CD4. The phenomenon of bimodal expression of a surface protein in cells derived from single clones provides a simple model of differentiation in vitro. We show how a hypothetical interaction between CD4 and a multimer of Vpu, the multimerization of which is cooperative, would lead to bimodal expression of CD4. This model may be generalized and could explain other cellular 'switches'."
14722278,A novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay demonstrates that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Pr55Gag I domain mediates Gag-Gag interactions.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) assembly takes place at the plasma membrane of cells and is directed by the Pr55(Gag) polyprotein (Gag). One of the essential steps in the assembly process is the multimerization of Gag. We have developed a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for the detection of protein-protein interactions between Gag molecules. We demonstrate that Gag multimerization takes place primarily on cellular membranes, with the majority of these interactions occurring on the plasma membrane. However, distinct sites of Gag-Gag interaction are also present at punctate intracellular locations. The I domain is a functional assembly domain within the nucleocapsid region of Gag that affects particle density, the subcellular localization of Gag, and the formation of detergent-resistant Gag protein complexes. Results from this study provide evidence that the I domain mediates Gag-Gag interactions. Using Gag-fluorescent protein fusion constructs that were previously shown to define the minimal I domain within HIV-1 Pr55(Gag), we show by FRET techniques that protein-protein interactions are greatly diminished when Gag proteins lacking the I domain are expressed. Gag-Tsg101 interactions are also seen in living cells and result in a shift of Tsg101 to the plasma membrane. The results within this study provide direct evidence that the I domain mediates protein-protein interactions between Gag molecules. Furthermore, this study establishes FRET as a powerful tool for the detection of protein-protein interactions involved in retrovirus assembly."
11024464,Membrane interactions and alignment of structures within the HIV-1 Vpu cytoplasmic domain: effect of phosphorylation of serines 52 and 56.,"The cytoplasmic domain of the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu is involved in the binding and degradation of the viral receptor CD4. In order to analyze previous structural models in the context of membrane environments, regions of Vpu(CYTO) incorporating particular conformational features have been synthesized and labelled with (15)N at selected backbone amides. Well-oriented proton-decoupled (15)N solid-state NMR spectra with (15)N chemical shifts at the most upfield position indicate that the amphipathic helix within [(15)N-Leu 45]-Vpu(27-57) strongly interacts with mechanically aligned POPC bilayers and adopts an orientation parallel to the membrane surface. No major changes in the topology of this membrane-associated amphipathic helix were observed upon phosphorylation of serine residues 52 and 56, although this modification regulates biological function of Vpu. In contrast, [(15)N-Ala 62]-Vpu(51-81) exhibits a pronounced (15)N chemical shift anisotropy."
9548947,"Backbone cyclic peptide, which mimics the nuclear localization signal of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 matrix protein, inhibits nuclear import and virus production in nondividing cells.","Here, we describe an application of the backbone cyclic (BC) proteinomimetic approach to the design and the synthesis of a BC peptide which functionally mimics the nuclear localization signal (NLS) region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 matrix protein (HIV-1 MA). On the basis of the NMR structure of HIV-1 MA, a library of BC peptides was designed and screened for the ability to inhibit nuclear import of NLS-BSA in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa and Colo-205 cultured cells. The screening yielded a lead compound (IC50 = 3 microM) which was used for the design of a second library. This library led to the discovery of a highly potent BC peptide, designated BCvir, with an IC50 value of 35 nM. This inhibitory potency is compared to a value of 12 microM exhibited by the linear parent HIV-1 MA NLS peptide. BCvir also reduced HIV-1 production by 75% in infected nondividing cultured human T-cells and was relatively resistant to tryptic digestion. These properties make BCvir a potential candidate for the development of a novel class of antiviral drugs which will be based on blocking nuclear import of viral genomes."
11929983,Catalysis of cis/trans isomerization in native HIV-1 capsid by human cyclophilin A.,"Packaging of cyclophilin A (CypA) into HIV-1 virions is essential for efficient replication; however, the reason for this is unknown. Incorporation is mediated through binding to the Gly-89-Pro-90 peptide bond of the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 capsid (CA(N)). Despite the fact that CypA is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, catalytic activity on CA(N) has not been observed previously. We show here, using NMR exchange spectroscopy, that CypA does not only bind to CA(N) but also catalyzes efficiently the cis/trans isomerization of the Gly-89-Pro-90 peptide bond. In addition, conformational changes in CA(N) distal to the CypA binding loop are observed on CypA binding and catalysis. The results provide experimental evidence for efficient CypA catalysis on a natively folded and biologically relevant protein substrate."
12032547,Structure of the N-terminal 283-residue fragment of the immature HIV-1 Gag polyprotein.,"The capsid protein (CA) of the mature human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) contains an N-terminal beta-hairpin that is essential for formation of the capsid core particle. CA is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the Gag precursor polyprotein during viral maturation. We have determined the NMR structure of a 283-residue N-terminal fragment of immature HIV-1 Gag (Gag(283)), which includes the intact matrix (MA) and N-terminal capsid (CA(N)) domains. The beta-hairpin is unfolded in Gag(283), consistent with the proposal that hairpin formation occurs subsequent to proteolytic cleavage of Gag, triggering capsid assembly. Comparison of the immature and mature CA(N) structures reveals that beta-hairpin formation induces a approximately 2 A displacement of helix 6 and a concomitant displacement of the cyclophylin-A (CypA)-binding loop, suggesting a possible allosteric mechanism for CypA-mediated destabilization of the capsid particle during infectivity."
9305737,HIV protease substrate conformation: modulation by cyclophilin A.,"Cyclophilin A (CyPA), a cytosolic peptidyl-prolyl trans-cis isomerase can accelerate the trans-cis isomerization of Xxx-Pro peptide bonds. One- and two-dimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy were used to determine that the heptapeptide Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val, a model peptide of an HIV-1 protease cleavage site in the gag polyprotein of HIV-1, is a substrate for CyPA. Experiments revealed a slow exchange about the Tyr-Pro peptide bond with 30 +/- 5% in the cis conformation (pH 1-9). While the interconversion rate is too slow to measure by kinetic NMR methods in the absence of CyPA, these methods, saturation transfer and NOE experiments, established that CyPA enhanced the rate of trans-cis interconversion, a process inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA). With a substrate:CyPA ratio of 40:1, an interconversion rate of 2.5 s(-1) at 25 degrees C was observed."
8970978,Differential membrane binding of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 matrix protein.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 matrix protein (p17MA) plays a central role at both the early and late stages of the virus life cycle. During viral assembly, the p17MA domain of Pr55gag promotes membrane association, which is essential for the formation of viral particles. When viral infection occurs, the mature p17MA dissociates from the plasma membrane and participates in the nuclear targeting process. Thus, p17MA contains a reversible membrane binding signal to govern its differential subcellular localization and biological functions. We previously identified a membrane binding signal within the amino-terminal 31 amino acids of the matrix domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag, consisting of myristate and a highly basic region (W. Zhou, L. J. Parent, J. W. Wills, and M. D. Resh, J. Virol. 68:2556-2569, 1994). Here we show that exposure of this membrane binding signal is regulated in different Gag protein contexts. Within full-length Pr55gag, the membrane targeting signal is exposed and can direct Pr55gag as well as heterologous proteins to the plasma membrane. However, in the context of p17MA alone, this signal is hidden and unable to confer plasma membrane binding. To investigate the molecular mechanism for regulation of membrane binding, a series of deletions within p17MA was generated by sequentially removing alpha-helical regions defined by the nuclear magnetic resonance structure. Removal of the last alpha helix (amino acids 97 to 109) of p17MA was associated with enhancement of binding to biological membranes in vitro and in vivo. Liposome binding experiments indicated that the C-terminal region of p17MA exerts a negative effect on the N-terminal MA membrane targeting domain by sequestering the myristate signal. We propose that mature p17MA adopts a conformation different from that of the p17MA domain within Pr55gag and present evidence to support this hypothesis. It is likely that such a conformational change results in an N-terminal myristyl switch which governs differential membrane binding."
8065455,Structural similarity between the p17 matrix protein of HIV-1 and interferon-gamma.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) matrix protein, p17, forms the outer shell of the core of the virus, lining the inner surface of the viral membrane. The protein has several key functions. It orchestrates viral assembly via targeting signals that direct the gag precursor polyprotein, p55, to the host cell membrane and it interacts with the transmembrane protein, gp41, to retain the env-encoded proteins in the virus. In addition, p17 contains a nuclear localization signal that directs the preintegration complex to the nucleus of infected cells. This permits the virus to infect productively non-dividing cells, a distinguishing feature of HIV and other lentiviruses. We have determined the solution structure of p17 by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with a root-mean square deviation for the backbone of the well-defined regions of 0.9 A. It consists of four helices connected by short loops and an irregular, mixed beta-sheet which provides a positively charged surface for interaction with the inner layer of the membrane. The helical topology is unusual; the Brookhaven protein database contains only one similar structure, that of the immune modulator interferon-gamma."
8626571,Phosphorylation of Vif and its role in HIV-1 replication.,"Vif is a 23-kDa protein encoded by human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) which is important for virion infectivity. Here, we describe the phosphorylation of HIV-1 Vif and its role in HIV-1 replication. In vivo studies demonstrated that Vif is highly phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. To identify phosphorylation sites and characterize the Vif kinase(s), Vif was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified for use as a substrate in in vitro kinase assays. The purified Vif protein was phosphorylated in vitro on serine and threonine residues by a kinase(s) present in both cytosol and membrane fractions. Phosphorylation of Vif was stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and inhibited by staurosporine and hypericin, a drug with potent anti-HIV activity. The Vif kinase(s) was resistant to inhibitors of protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent kinase, and cGMP-dependent kinase, suggesting that it is distinct from these enzymes. To identify the phosphorylation sites, 32P-labeled Vif was digested by V8 protease and the peptides were resolved by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Radioactive peptide sequencing identified three phosphorylation sites within the C terminus, Ser144, Thr155, and Thr188. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping indicated that these sites are also phosphorylated in vivo. Both Ser144 and Thr188 are contained in the recognition motifs (R/KXXS*/T* and R/KXXXS*/T*) used by serine/threonine protein kinases such as cGMP-dependent kinase and PKC. Ser144 is present in the motif SLQXLA, which is the most highly conserved sequence among all lentivirus Vif proteins. Mutation of Ser144 to alanine resulted in loss of Vif activity and >90% inhibition of HIV-1 replication. These studies suggest that phosphorylation of Vif by a serine/threonine protein kinase(s) plays an important role in regulating HIV-1 replication and infectivity."
12208976,Three isoforms of cyclophilin A associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 were found by proteomics by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain LAV-1 (HIV-1(LAV-1)) particles were collected by ultracentrifugation, treated with subtilisin, and then purified by Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography to remove microvesicles. The lysate of the purified HIV-1(LAV-1) particles was subjected to two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and stained. The 2D gel electrophoresis image suggested that 24 proteins can be identified inside the virion. Furthermore, the stained protein spots were excised and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptide fragments were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Peptide mass fingerprinting data suggested that two isoforms of cyclophilin A (CyPA), one with an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.40 and one with a pI of 6.53, are inside the viral membrane; that another isoform, with a pI of 6.88, is outside the viral membrane; and that the CyPA isoform with a pI of 6.53 is N acetylated. The mechanisms that permit the redistribution of CyPA on the viral surface have not yet been clarified, but it is surmised that the CyPA isoform with a pI of 6.88 may play a critical role in the attachment of virions to the surface of target cells and that both CyPA isoforms with pIs of 6.40 and 6.53 may regulate the conformation of the HIV-1 capsid protein."
8892894,Cytoskeletal proteins inside human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virions.,"We have identified three types of cytoskeletal proteins inside human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions by analyzing subtilisin-digested particles. HIV-1 virions were digested with protease, and the treated particles were isolated by sucrose density centrifugation. This method removes both exterior viral proteins and proteins associated with microvesicles that contaminate virion preparations. Since the proteins inside the virion are protected from digestion by the viral lipid envelope, they can be isolated and analyzed after treatment. Experiments presented here demonstrated that this procedure removed more than 95% of the protein associated with microvesicles. Proteins in digested HIV-1(MN) particles from infected H9 and CEM(ss) cell lines were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography, protein sequencing, and immunoblotting. The data revealed that three types of cytoskeletal proteins are present in virions at different concentrations relative to the molar level of Gag: actin (approximately 10 to 15%), ezrin and moesin (approximately 2%), and cofilin (approximately 2 to 10%). Our analysis of proteins within virus particles detected proteolytic fragments of alpha-smooth muscle actin and moesin that were cleaved at sites which might be recognized by HIV-1 protease. These cleavage products are not present in microvesicles from uninfected cells. Therefore, these processed proteins are most probably produced by HIV-1 protease digestion. The presence of these fragments, as well as the incorporation of a few specific cytoskeletal proteins into virions, suggests an active interaction between cytoskeletal and viral proteins."
19339972,Structural basis for assembly and disassembly of the CRM1 nuclear export complex.,"CRM1 (or exportin 1, Xpo1) transports proteins out of the cell nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. In the cytoplasm, GTP hydrolysis and consequent dissociation of Ran from CRM1 releases low-affinity substrates, while additional factors facilitate release of high-affinity substrates. Here we provide a model for human CRM1 export complex assembly and disassembly through structural and biochemical analyses of CRM1 bound to the substrate snurportin 1 (SNUPN, also called snuportin 1)."
14610174,The human polycomb group EED protein interacts with the integrase of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"Human EED, a member of the superfamily of WD-40 repeat proteins and of the Polycomb group proteins, has been identified as a cellular partner of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) matrix (MA) protein (R. Peytavi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:1635-1645, 1999). In the present study, EED was found to interact with HIV-1 integrase (IN) both in vitro and in vivo in yeast. In vitro, data from mutagenesis studies, pull-down assays, and phage biopanning suggested that EED-binding site(s) are located in the C-terminal domain of IN, between residues 212 and 264. In EED, two putative discrete IN-binding sites were mapped to its N-terminal moiety, at a distance from the MA-binding site, but EED-IN interaction also required the integrity of the EED last two WD repeats. EED showed an apparent positive effect on IN-mediated DNA integration reaction in vitro, in a dose-dependent manner. In situ analysis by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) of cellular distribution of IN and EED in HIV-1-infected cells (HeLa CD4(+) cells or MT4 lymphoid cells) showed that IN and EED colocalized in the nucleus and near nuclear pores, with maximum colocalization events occurring at 6 h postinfection (p.i.). Triple colocalizations of IN, EED, and MA were also observed in the nucleoplasm of infected cells at 6 h p.i., suggesting the ocurrence of multiprotein complexes involving these three proteins at early steps of the HIV-1 virus life cycle. Such IEM patterns were not observed with a noninfectious, envelope deletion mutant of HIV-1."
8679287,Aspects of molecular interaction between HIV p17 and human gamma interferon.,"We describe the specific interaction between high-purity recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p17 and human gamma interferon (hIFN-gamma) proteins. This interaction was found to be dose dependent and to involve conformational epitopes on both sides. Specificity was confirmed by competition ELISA, using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to hIFN-gamma as specific reagents. By competition experiments we also identified the epitope(s) on the hIFN-gamma molecule involved in p17 binding, very close to the receptor binding site. The kinetic constants were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. The affinity constant (KA) of the complex was 2.78 x 10(8) M-1, that is, the ratio between a low dissociation rate constant (Koff)(1 x 10(-5)sec-1) and a high association rate constant (Kon) (3 x 10(3) M-1sec-1). However, p17 did not displace the binding of hIFN-gamma to its cellular receptor, nor did it interfere with the capability of the lymphokine to induce de novo expression of HLA-DR antigens on human monocytic cells or to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells."
15064754,X-ray structure of a minor group human rhinovirus bound to a fragment of its cellular receptor protein.,"Although many viral receptors have been identified, the ways in which they interact with their cognate viruses are not understood at the molecular level. We have determined the X-ray structure of a complex between calcium-containing modules of the very low-density lipoprotein receptor and the minor group human rhinovirus HRV2. The receptor binds close to the icosahedral five-fold vertex, with only one module per virus protomer. The binding face of this module is defined by acidic calcium-chelating residues and, in particular, by an exposed tryptophan that is highly conserved. The attachment site on the virus involves only residues from VP1, particularly a lysine strictly conserved in all minor group HRVs. The disposition of the attached ligand-binding repeats around the five-fold axis, together with the proximity of the N- and C-terminal ends of adjacent modules, suggests that more than one repeat in a single receptor molecule might attach simultaneously."
10794694,Design of a Gag pentapeptide analogue that binds human cyclophilin A more efficiently than the entire capsid protein: new insights for the development of novel anti-HIV-1 drugs.,"Cyclophilin A (hCyp-18), a ubiquitous cytoplasmic peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase), orchestrates HIV-1 core packaging. hCyp-18, incorporated into the virion, enables core uncoating and RNA release and consequently plays a critical role in the viral replication process. hCyp-18 specifically interacts with a single exposed loop of the Gag polyprotein capsid domain via a network of nine hydrogen bonds which mainly implicates a 7-mer fragment of the loop. As previously reported, the corresponding linear heptapeptide Ac-Val-His-Ala-Gly-Pro-Ile-Ala-NH(2) (2) binds to hCyp-18 with a low affinity (IC(50) = 850 +/- 220 microM) but a potentially useful selectivity for hCyp-18 relative to hFKBP-12, another abundant PPIase. On the basis of X-ray structures of Gag fragments:hCyp-18 complexes, we generated a series of modified peptides in order to probe the determinants of the interaction and hence to select a peptidic ligand displaying a higher affinity than the capsid domain of Gag. We synthesized a series of heptapeptides to test the energetic contribution of amino acids besides the Gly-Pro moiety. In particular the importance of the histidine residue for the interaction was underscored. We also investigated the influence of N- and C-terminal modifications. Hexapeptides containing either deaminovaline (Dav) in place of the N-terminal valine or substitution of the C-terminal alanine amide with a benzylamide group displayed increased affinities. Combination of both modifications gave the most potent competitor Dav-His-Ala-Gly-Pro-Ile-NHBn (28) which has a higher affinity for hCyp-18 (K(d) = 3 +/- 0.5 microM) than the entire capsid protein (K(d) = 16 +/- 4 microM) and a very low affinity for hFKBP-12. Some of our results strongly suggest that the title compound is not a substrate of hCyp-18 and interacts preferentially in the trans conformation."
9261419,Cyclophilin A-induced alterations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 CA protein in vitro.,"Cyclophilin A (CyP A), a cellular chaperone with cis-trans prolyl isomerase activity, is required for postassembly events in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. The requirement for CyP A maps to sequences in the capsid (CA) domain of the structural precursor, Gag. To determine the effects of interaction with CyP A on capsid (CA) protein structure, the binding interaction was investigated in vitro, using recombinant HIV-1 CA protein (which forms oligomers in solution) and human CyP A. The CA and CyP A proteins interacted to form a complex which was detected predominantly as a heterodimer on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. Complex formation exhibited a pH optimum of 5. The CA protein in the complex was exclusively in a conformation whereby the N terminus was blocked to Edman degradation. This finding was unexpected since CyP A binds to the central region of the CA protein (residues 85 to 93). Examination of CA protein incubated with CyP A for alterations in structure indicated that CyP A preferentially interacted with the subpopulation of trypsin-susceptible subunits in the oligomers and significantly reduced their sensitivity to proteolysis. Like CA-CyP A complex formation, conversion to trypsin resistance also exhibited a pH optimum of 5. Both complex formation and the changes in tryptic susceptibility were only partially inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA). This appeared to be due to a CA subpopulation able to bind CyP A despite the presence of CsA. Our results identify specific tryptic sites both proximal and distal to the CyP A binding region that are altered by CyP A binding and/or by CyP A's prolyl isomerase activity. Comparison with the X-ray structure of a complex containing CyP A bound to an amino-terminal fragment of the CA protein (CA1-151) (T.R. Gamble et al., Cell 87:1285-1294, 1996) indicates that the tryptic sites that become inaccessible are among the same residues that lose a significant amount of accessible surface area through CA-CA subunit contacts made in the presence of CyP A."
9385632,Crystal structure of cyclophilin A complexed with a binding site peptide from the HIV-1 capsid protein.,"The cellular protein, cyclophilin A (CypA), is incorporated into the virion of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) via a direct interaction with the capsid domain of the viral Gag polyprotein. We demonstrate that the capsid sequence 87His-Ala-Gly-Pro-Ile-Ala92 (87HAGPIA92) encompasses the primary cyclophilin A binding site and present an X-ray crystal structure of the CypA/HAGPIA complex. In contrast to the cis prolines observed in all previously reported structures of CypA complexed with model peptides, the proline in this peptide, Pro 90, binds the cyclophilin A active site in a trans conformation. We also report the crystal structure of a complex between CypA and the hexapeptide HVGPIA, which also maintains the trans conformation. Comparison with the recently determined structures of CypA in complexes with larger fragments of the HIV-1 capsid protein demonstrates that CypA recognition of these hexapeptides involves contacts with peptide residues Ala(Val) 88, Gly 89, and Pro 90, and is independent of the context of longer sequences."
3878413,Crystallization and X-ray diffraction studies on the histocompatibility antigens HLA-A2 and HLA-A28 from human cell membranes.,"The human histocompatibility antigens HLA-A and HLA-B are polymorphic cell surface glycoproteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex. These molecules are the major targets for the immune response during tissue transplantation. They are recognized by cytolytic T-lymphocytes during the immune response against virally infected cells, and have been linked to variations in susceptibility to human autoaggressive and neoplastic diseases. To permit a description of the sites of interaction with alloantisera and T-cell receptors, we have begun a three-dimensional structure determination of HLA-A. We report the isomorphous cyrstallization of two antigenic specificities of papain-solubilized HLA-A, A2 and A28. Isoelectric focusing indicates that the well-ordered crystals incorporate the sialic acid microheterogeneity of the oligosaccharides. Crystallographic evidence indicates that the HLA-A molecule has an approximate 2-fold rotational symmetry axis which, combined with biochemical data, suggests that the domains of the molecule are paired alpha 1 to alpha 2 and alpha 3 to beta 2-microglobulin. This domain organization is similar to the arrangement of domains in the Fab and Fc fragments of immunoglobulins."
7794916,Interaction of nucleolar protein B23 with peptides related to nuclear localization signals.,"Nucleolar protein B23 is a putative ribosome assembly factor with a high affinity for peptides containing nuclear localization signals (NLSs). The interactions of various NLS-containing peptides with two B23 isoforms (B23.1 and B23.2) were examined using equilibrium dialysis and Scatchard analyses. The KD for protein B23 binding to a peptide containing the SV40 T-antigen NLS sequence was approximately 1 microM with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (peptide:protein). No significant differences were seen between the two B23 isoforms in their affinities for any of the peptides tested. Binding by a reverse sequence SV40 T-NLS peptide showed a nonlinear Scatchard plot: this peptide was unable displace the correct sequence peptide, suggesting that the reverse sequence peptide binds to a different site on the protein. A peptide containing the sequence required for nucleolar localization of the HIV-1 Rev protein had an affinity for B23 approximately 10-fold greater than that of the SV40 T-NLS. However, with a sequence sufficient only for Rev location in the nucleoplasm, the affinity for B23 was diminished to a level between that of the longer Rev sequence and the SV40 T-NLS. In competition binding assays, the Rev NLS peptide was able to displace the SV40 T NLS, indicating that both peptides bind to the same site on protein B23. There was no detectable binding to protein B23 by a peptide containing the bipartite NLS of nucleoplasmin. Phosphorylation of protein B23 by casein kinase II enhanced its affinity for the SV40 T- and Rev-derived peptides approximately 2-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
12181673,Immunophilins and HIV-1 infection.,"Peptides of the V3 loop of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 have been shown to bind with high affinity to the immunophilins cyclophilin (Cyp) A, CypB and the FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) [10]. We investigated whether immunophilins affect HIV-1 infection by assuming they are able to bind to the V3 loop of gp120. T cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were infected with T-cell-tropic or macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains, respectively, in the presence of different concentrations of immunophilins. P24 antigen ELISA and real-time PCR measurements demonstrated that exogenously added immunophilins do not influence HIV-1 infection. CypA is known to interact with the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein and to be incorporated into the virions. This incorporation can be prevented by cyclosporin A (CsA) resulting in a decreased yield of infectious virus, the mechanism of which is unknown. We measured a normal production of proviral DNA in the first round of infection in CsA treated cells but afterwards, infection was decreased if CsA was present. Pre-treatment of the HIV-1 inocula with CsA, blocking the function of virus-associated CypA, did not inhibit the ensuing yield of infection. We therefore may conclude that endogenous CypA exerts its action after reverse transcription but before virus maturation, probably during capsid formation. FK520, an immunosuppressor which binds to FKBP, had no effect on HIV-1 infection."
8883365,Specific binding of polypyrimidine tract binding protein and hnRNP A1 to HIV-1 CRS elements.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Rev and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) Rex proteins regulate viral RNA processing. Both proteins act to overcome the block to viral structural gene expression, at least in part, by reversing the inhibitory effect of intronic RNA sequences, termed cis-acting repressive (CRS) sequences. Using HTLV type II (HTLV-II) as a model, we recently showed that the function of a 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) CRS correlates with in vitro binding by both polypyrimidine tract binding (PTB) protein (also known as hnRNP I) and hnRNP A1 to CRS RNA (1,2). Using radioimmunoprecipitation of proteins ultraviolet (UV) crosslinked to each HIV CRS RNA with monoclonal anti-hnRNP antibodies, we now demonstrate that hnRNP I and hnRNP A1 bind to two different HIV-1 CRS RNAs. In addition, we show that hnRNP I and hnRNP A1 binding to HIV-1 CRS RNAs can be specifically competed by HTLV-II CRS RNAs using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)/UV crosslinking assays. Binding by both hnRNP I and hnRNP A1 to HIV-1 and HTLV-II CRS RNAs suggests a role for these proteins in CRS function that may be influenced by the Rev and Rex proteins, respectively."
16501079,Annexin 2: a novel human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag binding protein involved in replication in monocyte-derived macrophages.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in the major natural target cells, CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophages, is parallel in many aspects of the virus life cycle. However, it differs as to viral assembly and budding, which take place on plasma membranes in T cells and on endosomal membranes in macrophages. It has been postulated that cell type-specific host factors may aid in directing viral assembly to distinct destinations. In this study we defined annexin 2 (Anx2) as a novel HIV Gag binding partner in macrophages. Anx2-Gag binding was confined to productively infected macrophages and was not detected in quiescently infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in which an HIV replication block was mapped to the late stages of the viral life cycle (A. V. Albright, R. M. Vos, and F. Gonzalez-Scarano, Virology 325:328-339, 2004). We demonstrate that the Anx2-Gag interaction likely occurs at the limiting membranes of late endosomes/multivesicular bodies and that Anx2 depletion is associated with a significant decline in the infectivity of released virions; this coincided with incomplete Gag processing and inefficient incorporation of CD63. Cumulatively, our data suggest that Anx2 is essential for the proper assembly of HIV in MDM."
11878889,Association of Vpu-binding protein with microtubules and Vpu-dependent redistribution of HIV-1 Gag protein.,"The efficient exit of HIV-1 particles from cells requires the action of the viral encoded protein Vpu. Vpu-binding protein (Ubp) is a cellular protein that interacts with both Vpu and the major structural component of the viral capsid (Gag) and appears to affect the efficiency of particle exit. Elucidation of the function of Ubp and characterization of the spatial distribution of Ubp may provide information pertinent to understanding the role of Ubp in virus replication. To investigate the subcellular location of Ubp, and to see whether Vpu affects the intracellular distribution of Gag, we carried out immunofluorescence localization in conjunction with confocal microscopy. Based on this analysis Ubp is present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, Ubp appeared to be associated with microtubules as evidenced by cofluorescence with tubulin in the absence and in the presence of colchicine. However, cytoskeletal isolation and detergent extraction of cells resulted in association of Ubp with the soluble fractions, indicating that Ubp is not in tight association with microtubules. Moreover, flotation gradient analysis demonstrated that Ubp is cytoplasmic and not stably associated with the plasma membrane. Interestingly, expression of Vpu in cells resulted in redistribution of both Ubp and Gag to a location near the periphery of the cell. The effect of Vpu on both Ubp and Gag protein has implications for Vpu-mediated particle exit from cells."
7961587,Intracellular membrane traffic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoproteins: vpu liberates Golgi-targeted gp160 from CD4-dependent retention in the endoplasmic reticulum.,"The membrane traffic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins has been investigated in COS-1 cells transiently expressing the HIV-1 env, vpu, and rev genes. Analysis of oligosaccharide processing revealed that the majority of gp160 remained fully endo-H sensitive throughout a 21-h chase period, and hence cleavage of gp160 to gp120-gp41 took place prior to the creation of hybrid and complex oligosaccharides on gp120. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that in the absence of CD4 both gp160 and Vpu are targeted to the Golgi apparatus, that can be stained with wheat germ agglutinin or antibodies to the human KDEL receptor. In contrast, gp160 complexed with CD4 was retained in the ER and thus failed to reach the cis-Golgi compartment. Although gp160-bound CD4 has its own half life of 4 h 35 min in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), co-expression of Vpu accelerated the turnover of CD4 by 5.5-fold and thereby enabled gp160 to be translocated out of the ER to the cis-Golgi compartment. We concluded that Vpu prevents the formation of stable CD4-gp160 complexes in the ER and thus indirectly allows gp160 to accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, where it is selectively retained to produce gp120-gp41."
12230470,Human macrophages accumulate HIV-1 particles in MHC II compartments.,"Macrophages are important targets for HIV-1 infection and harbor the virions in an as yet unidentified organelle. To determine the location of HIV-1 in these cells, an extensive analysis of primary human macrophages infected in vitro with HIV-1 was carried out by immuno-electron microscopy. Virus particles were found to accumulate in intracellular multivesicular compartments which were enriched in major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and CD63. These features are characteristics of major histocompatibility complex class II compartments where maturing class II molecules acquire their peptide cargo. The membrane-delimited, electron-dense virus particles of 100-110 nm diameter labeled strongly for HIV-1 p24 antigen, major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, CD63 and, to a lesser extent for HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein and Lamp 1. Our data suggest that virus particles may access the lumen of the major histocompatibility complex class II compartment by budding from the limiting membrane, thus acquiring proteins of this membrane such as class II and CD63. Viral assembly and budding would therefore occur in macrophages by a process similar to the formation of the internal vesicles in multivesicular bodies and at the same location. This could account for the particular content in lipids and proteins previously found in the membrane wrapping HIV particles. Our observations also suggest direct fusion of the virus containing major histocompatibility complex class II compartment with the plasma membrane, leading to massive release of viral particles into the extracellular medium."
7593322,The roles of nucleolar structure and function in the subcellular location of the HIV-1 Rev protein.,"The human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) Rev transactivator protein plays a critical role in the regulation of expression of structural proteins by controlling the pathway of mRNA transport. The Rev protein is located predominantly in the nucleoli of HIV-1 infected or Rev-expressing cells. Previous studies demonstrated that the Rev protein forms a specific complex in vitro with protein B23 which is suggested to be a nucleolar receptor and/or carrier for the Rev protein. To study the role of the nucleolus and nucleolar proteins in Rev function, transfected COS-7 or transformed CMT3 cells expressing the Rev protein were examined for subcellular locations of Rev and other proteins using indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. One day after transfection the Rev protein was found in most cells only in the nucleolar dense fibrillar and granular components where it colocalized with protein B23. These were designated class 1 cells. In a second class of cells Rev and B23 accumulated in the nucleoplasm as well as in nucleoli. Treatment of class 1 cells with actinomycin D (AMD) under conditions that blocked only RNA polymerase I transcription caused Rev to completely redistribute from nucleoli to the cytoplasm. Simultaneously, protein B23 was partially released from nucleoli, mostly into the nucleoplasm, with detectable amounts in the cytoplasm. In cells recovering from AMD treatment in the presence of cycloheximide Rev and B23 showed coincident relocation to nucleoli. Class 2 cells were resistant to AMD-induced Rev redistribution. Selective inhibition of RNA polymerase II transcription by alpha-amanitin or by DRB did not cause Rev to be released into the cytoplasm suggesting that active preribosomal RNA transcription is required for the nucleolar location of Rev. However, treatment with either of the latter two drugs at higher doses and for longer times caused partial disruption of nucleoli accompanied by translocation of the Rev protein to the cytoplasm. These results suggest that the nucleolar location of Rev depends on continuous preribosomal RNA transcription and a substantially intact nucleolar structure."
8523563,Cytoskeleton association and virion incorporation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vif protein.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif protein has an important role in the regulation of virus infectivity. This function of Vif is cell type specific, and virions produced in the absence of Vif in restrictive cells have greatly reduced infectivity. We show here that the intracellular localization of Vif is dependent on the presence of the intermediate filament vimentin. Fractionation of acutely infected T cells or transiently transfected HeLa cells demonstrates the existence of a soluble and a cytoskeletal form and to a lesser extent the presence of a detergent-extractable form of Vif. Confocal microscopy suggests that in HeLa cells, Vif is predominantly present in the cytoplasm and closely colocalizes with the intermediate filament vimentin. Treatment of cells with drugs affecting the structure of vimentin filaments affect the localization of Vif accordingly, indicating a close association of Vif with this cytoskeletal component. The association of Vif with vimentin can cause the collapse of the intermediate filament network into a perinuclear aggregate. In contrast, analysis of Vif in vimentin-negative cells reveals significant staining of the nucleus and the nuclear membrane in addition to diffuse cytoplasmic staining. In addition to the association of Vif with intermediate filaments, analyses of virion preparations demonstrate that Vif is incorporated into virus particles. In sucrose density gradients, Vif cosediments with capsid proteins even after detergent treatment of virus preparations, suggesting that Vif is associated with the inner core of HIV particles. We propose a model in which Vif has a crucial function as a virion component either by regulating virus maturation or following virus entry into a host cell possibly involving an interaction with the cellular cytoskeletal network."
9557731,Cryoelectron microscopic examination of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virions with mutations in the cyclophilin A binding loop.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 capsid protein contains a conserved P217X4PX2PX5P231 motif. Mutation at Pro-222 decreases virion incorporation of cyclophilin A, while mutation at Pro-231 abolishes infectivity. Although viral RNA incorporation and protease cleavage of the Gag precursor were not affected by these mutations, cryoelectron microscopy revealed a loss of virion maturation in P231A particles."
9181467,Obstruction of HIV-1 particle release by interferon-alpha occurs before viral protease processing and is independent of envelope glycoprotein.,"The effect of human interferon-alpha (Hu-IFN-alpha) on the maturation process of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been studied using stable cell lines that produce nonenveloped particles. These cell lines secrete particles devoid of the viral envelope proteins gp120 and gp41. The CH-1 cells produce active viral protease that correctly processes its natural substrates, whereas the CH-1kww cell line expresses an enzymatically inactive viral protease, thus producing immature viral capsids. A block in the secretion of particles was observed in both cell lines when treated with 100-1000 U/ml Hu-IFN-alpha, as judged by measurements of encapsidated gag proteins. Electron microscopy shows that Hu-IFN-alpha-treated CH-1 cells are decorated with assembled immature particles at the cell surface. These results suggest that the observed block in particle release on Hu-IFN-alpha treatment is independent of viral envelope expression and occurs before capsid polyprotein processing. In addition, particles remaining attached to the cell fail to mature into structures with condensed cores. Viral gag proteins from IFN-treated and untreated CH-1 cells were analyzed by 2-D gel electrophoresis. Results suggest a change in posttranslational modifications of gag proteins, as IFN treatment allowed the detection of more basic forms of p55, p39, and p24. Further analysis of cellular or viral protein alterations induced by Hu-IFN-alpha treatment may identify the mechanism of action by which particle maturation is obstructed."
12239324,Rev inhibition strongly affects intracellular distribution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNAs.,"To define the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA maturation pathways, we analyzed the intracellular distribution of HIV-1 RNA and the viral regulatory proteins Rev and Tat in transfected COS cells and HIV-1-infected lymphoid C8166 cells by means of ultrastructural in situ hybridization using antisense RNA probes and immunoelectron microscopy. The intranuclear viral RNA occurs in ribonucleoprotein fibrils in the perichromatin and interchromatin regions. The simultaneous demonstration of Rev, Tat, Br-labeled RNA, and cellular proteins SC35 and CRM1 in such fibrils reveals the potential of Rev to associate with nascent HIV pre-mRNA and its splicing complex and transport machinery. In a rev-minus system, the env intron-containing, incompletely spliced viral RNAs are revealed only in the nucleus, indicating that Rev is required to initiate the transport to the cytoplasm. Moreover, env intron sequences frequently occur in the periphery of interchromatin granule clusters, while the probe containing the rev exon sequence does not associate with this nucleoplasmic domain. When cells were treated with the CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B in the presence of Rev protein, the env intron containing HIV RNAs formed clusters throughout the nucleoplasm and accumulated at the nuclear pores. This suggests that Rev is necessary and probably also sufficient for the accumulation of incompletely spliced HIV RNAs at the nuclear pores while CRM1 is needed for translocation across the nuclear pore complex."
9541613,Histographic recording of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Rev and nuclear factors.,"HeLa cells and HeLa cells expressing the HIV-1 regulatory protein Rev were immunostained for Rev and pre-mRNA processing factors and examined histographically by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Following short pulse-labelling with bromouridine tri-phosphate nascent RNA gave a granular nucleoplasmic staining increasing somewhat towards the periphery as did also the heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A1 and particularly C1/C2, a distribution pattern which has not been described. The sm-antigen of the small ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) proteins U1, U2, U4/U6 and U5 stained the nucleoplasm diffusely in addition to speckles which co-localised with speckles of the non-snRNP splicing factor SC-35. Brominated RNA and the hnRNPs A1 and C1/C2 were to varying degrees excluded from the speckles. Rev concentrated in the nucleolus and often as a perinucleolar ring/zone. Rev also stained the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm without co-localising with the above-mentioned proteins or brominated RNA and was not enriched or excluded in SC-35 speckles. The nucleolar proteins B23 and C23, like Rev, gave primarily a perinucleolar ring and stained the nucleoplasm but did not otherwise co-localise with Rev or with nuclear proteins. Histographic recording of immunofluorescence images proved to be a valuable tool in the study of localisation of HIV-1 Rev and cellular components and of possible co-localisations. A parallel comparison of the subcellular patterns of pre-mRNA processing factors versus major nucleolar antigens is new and suggests that the factors are not strictly separated in the nucleoplasm."
15207618,The equine herpesvirus 1 EICP27 protein enhances gene expression via an interaction with TATA box-binding protein.,"The mechanism(s) by which the early EICP27 gene product cooperates with other equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) regulatory proteins to achieve maximal promoter activity remains unknown. Transient transfection assays revealed that deletion of residues 93-140 of the 470-aa EICP27 protein substantially diminished its activation of the immediate-early (IE) promoter, whereas deletion of residues 140-470 that contain a zinc-finger motif abolished this activity. Fluorescence microscopy of cells expressing the full-length EICP27 protein or portions of this protein revealed that an arginine-rich sequence spanning residues 178-185 mediates nuclear entry. Experiments employing the mammalian Gal4 two-plasmid system revealed that the EICP27 protein does not possess an independent trans-activation domain (TAD). Protein-protein interaction assays using purified proteins revealed that residues 124-220 of the EICP27 protein mediate its direct interaction with TATA box-binding protein (TBP). Partial deletion of this TBP-binding domain attenuated the ability of the EICP27 protein to stimulate the IE and early EICP0 promoters by 68% and 71%, respectively, indicating the importance of this protein-protein interaction."
15303969,"Hepatitis C virus non-structural protein NS3 interacts with LMP7, a component of the immunoproteasome, and affects its proteasome activity.","NS3, a non-structural protein of the HCV (hepatitis C virus), contains a protease and a helicase domain and plays essential roles in the processing of the viral polyprotein, viral RNA replication and translation. LMP7 (low-molecular-mass protein 7), a component of the immunoproteasome, was identified as an NS3-binding protein from yeast two-hybrid screens, and this interaction was confirmed by in vitro binding and co-immunoprecipitation analysis. The minimal domain of interaction was defined to be between the pro-sequence region of LMP7 (amino acids 1-40) and the protease domain of NS3. To elucidate the biological importance of this interaction, we studied the effect of this interaction on NS3 protease activity and on LMP7 immunoproteasome activity. Recombinant LMP7 did not have any effect on NS3 protease activity in vitro. The peptidase activities of LMP7 immunoproteasomes, however, were markedly reduced when tested in a stable cell line containing a HCV subgenomic replicon. The down-regulation of proteasome peptidase activities could interfere with the processing of viral antigens for presentation by MHC class I molecules, and may thus protect HCV from host immune surveillance mechanisms to allow persistent infection by the virus."
11152681,"Prmt5, which forms distinct homo-oligomers, is a member of the protein-arginine methyltransferase family.","We found that JBP1, known as a human homolog (Skb1Hs) of Skb1 of fission yeast, interacts with NS3 of the hepatitis C virus in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that Skb1Hs/JBP1 contains conserved motifs of S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent protein-arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). Here, we demonstrate that Skb1Hs/JBP1, named PRMT5, is a distinct member of the PRMT family. Recombinant PRMT5 protein purified from human cells methylated myelin basic protein, histone, and the amino terminus of fibrillarin fused to glutathione S-transferase. Myelin basic protein methylated by PRMT5 contained monomethylated and dimethylated arginine residues. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase-PRMT5 protein expressed in Escherichia coli also contained the catalytic activity. Sedimentation analysis of purified PRMT5 on a sucrose density gradient indicated that PRMT5 formed distinct homo-oligomeric complexes, including a dimer and tetramer, that comigrated with the enzyme activity. The PRMT5 homo-oligomers were dissociated into a monomer in the presence of a reducing agent, whereas a monomer, dimer, and multimer were detected in the absence or at low concentrations of a reducing agent. The results indicate that both covalent linkage by a disulfide bond and noncovalent association are involved in the formation of PRMT5 homo-oligomers. Western blot analysis of sedimentation fractions suggests that endogenous PRMT5 is present as a homo-oligomer in a 293T cell extract. PRMT5 appears to have lower specific enzyme activity than PRMT1. Although PRMT1 is known to be mainly located in the nucleus, human PRMT5 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm."
11922617,Human eukaryotic initiation factor 4AII associates with hepatitis C virus NS5B protein in vitro.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein has been shown to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity by itself and is a key enzyme involved in viral replication. Using analyses with the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assay, we found that human eukaryotic initiation factor 4AII (heIF4AII), which is a component of the eIF4F complex and RNA-dependent ATPase/helicase, interacted with NS5B protein. These two proteins were shown to be partially colocalized in the perinuclear region. The binding site in HCV NS5B protein was localized within amino acid residues 495 to 537 near the C terminus. Since eIF4A has a helicase activity and functions in a bidirectional manner, the binding of HCV NS5B protein to heIF4AII raises the possibility that heIF4AII facilitates the genomic RNA synthesis of NS5B protein by unwinding the secondary structure of the HCV genome and is a host component of viral replication complex."
12532453,Interaction between hepatitis C virus core protein and translin protein--a possible molecular mechanism for hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphoma caused by hepatitis C virus.,To investigate the interaction between hepatitis C virus core protein and translin protein and its role in the pathogenensis of hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphoma.
12445808,Physical interaction between hepatitis C virus NS4B protein and CREB-RP/ATF6beta.,"By using a yeast two-hybrid assay, cyclic AMP-response-element-binding protein-related protein (CREB-RP), also called activating transcription factor 6beta (ATF6beta), was identified as a cellular protein that interacts with the NS4B protein of hepatitis C virus. An N-terminal half of NS4B and a central portion of CREB-RP/ATF6beta containing the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain were involved in the interaction. The interaction between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta was demonstrated also in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analyses using specific antibodies. The bZIP domain of ATF6alpha, which shares high sequence similarity with CREB-RP/ATF6beta, was also shown to interact with NS4B in yeast although the interaction was weaker than that between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta. CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha are known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced transcription factors. Collectively, our results imply the possibility that NS4B modulates certain cellular responses upon ER stress through the physical interaction with CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha."
15113910,Cellular RNA helicase p68 relocalization and interaction with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein and the potential role of p68 in HCV RNA replication.,"Chronic infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) can lead to severe hepatitis and cirrhosis and is closely associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. The replication cycle of HCV is poorly understood but is likely to involve interaction with host factors. In this report, we show that NS5B, the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), interacts with a human RNA helicase, p68. Transient expression of NS5B alone, as well as the stable expression of all the nonstructural proteins in a HCV replicon-bearing cell line (V. Lohmann, F. Korner, J.-O. Koch, U. Herian, L. Theilmann, and R. Bartenschlager, Science 285:110-113), causes the redistribution of endogenous p68 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Deletion of the C-terminal two-thirds of NS5B (NS5BDeltaC) dramatically reduces its coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) with endogenous p68, while the deletion of the N-terminal region (NS5BDeltaN1 and NS5BDeltaN2) does not affect its interaction with p68. In consistency with the co-IP results, NS5BDeltaC does not cause the relocalization of p68 whereas NS5BDeltaN1 does. With a replicon cell line, we were not able to detect a change in positive- and negative-strand synthesis when p68 levels were reduced using small interfering RNA (siRNA). In cells transiently transfected with a full-length HCV construct, however, the depletion (using specific p68 siRNA) of endogenous p68 correlated with a reduction in the transcription of negative-strand from positive-strand HCV RNA. Overexpression of NS5B and NS5BDeltaN1, but not that of NS5BDeltaC, causes a reduction in the negative-strand synthesis, indicating that overexpressed NS5B and NS5BDeltaN1 sequesters p68 from the replication complexes (thus reducing their replication activity levels). Identification of p68 as a cellular factor involved in HCV replication, at least for cells transiently transfected with a HCV expression construct, is a step towards understanding HCV replication."
12101418,HCV NS5A interacts with p53 and inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes a persistent infection, chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV NS5A, one of non-structural proteins of HCV, was suggested to play a role in oncogenic transformation. Since the tumor suppressor p53 is important for preventing neoplastic transformation, we investigated the functional effects of HCV NS5A on p53. In vitro and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy were used to determine the interaction of NS5A and p53. HCV NS5A binds directly to p53 and colocalizes p53 in the perinuclear region. NS5A inhibits transcriptional transactivation by p53 in a dose-dependent manner by use of a reporter assay. Down regulation of endogenous p21/waf1 expression, which is activated by p53 in Hep3B cells, by NS5A was demonstrated by using FLAG- and FLAG-NS5A Hep3B stable cell lines. The effect of NS5A on p53-mediated apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry in both NS5A permanently and transiently transfected Hep3B cells with exogenous p53. The p53-induced apoptosis was abrogated by NS5A and the inhibition effect correlates well with the binding ability of NS5A to p53. In addition, HCV NS5A protein interacts with and colocalizes hTAF(II)32, a component of TFIID and an essential coactivator of p53, in vivo. These results suggest that HCV NS5A interacts with and partially sequestrates p53 and hTAF(II)32 in the cytoplasm and suppresses p53-mediated transcriptional transactivation and apoptosis during HCV infection, which may contribute to the hepatocarcinogenesis of HCV infection."
15893726,Identification of FBL2 as a geranylgeranylated cellular protein required for hepatitis C virus RNA replication.,"We recently reported that Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication requires one or more geranylgeranylated host proteins. Using a combination of [(3)H]mevalonate labeling, coimmunoprecipitation, and bioinformatic search, we identified a geranylgeranylated host protein required for HCV RNA replication. This protein, FBL2, contains an F box domain and a CAAX motif (CVIL). It forms a stable immunoprecipitable complex with the HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A). The association of FBL2 with NS5A requires the CAAX motif of FBL2, but not the F box. Deletion of the F box created a dominant-negative protein that inhibited replication of HCV RNA when overexpressed in Huh7-K2040 cells; this inhibition was overcome by coexpression of NS5A. siRNA-mediated knockdown of FBL2 mRNA by 70% in Huh7-HP cells reduced HCV RNA by 65%; this reduction was overcome by expression of a cDNA encoding a wobble mutant of FBL2. The current data indicate that geranylgeranylated FBL2 binds to NS5A in a reaction crucial for HCV RNA replication."
12427757,Direct interaction between nucleolin and hepatitis C virus NS5B.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a central catalytic enzyme in HCV replication. While studying the subcellular localization of a NS5B mutant lacking the C-terminal membrane-anchoring domain, NS5Bt, we found that expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused form was exclusively nucleolar. Interestingly, the distribution of endogenous nucleolin changed greatly in the cells expressing GFP-NS5B, with nucleolin colocalized with GFP-NS5B in perinuclear regions in addition to the nucleolus, suggesting that NS5B retains the ability to bind nucleolin. The interaction between nucleolin and NS5B was demonstrated by GST pull-down assay. GST pull-down assay results indicated that C-terminal region of nucleolin was important for its binding to NS5B. Scanning clustered alanine substitution mutants library of NS5B revealed two sites on NS5B that binds nucleolin. NS5B amino acids 208-214 and 500-506 were both found to be indispensable for the nucleolin binding. We reported that the latter sequence is essential for oligomerization of NS5B, which is a prerequisite for the RdRP activity. C-terminal nucleolin inhibited the NS5B RdRP activity in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, this indicates the binding ability of nucleolin may be involved in NS5B functions."
12077252,Recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to CD28 inhibits HIV transcription by a Tat-dependent mechanism.,"Activation through the TCR and the costimulatory molecule CD28 influences the susceptibility of T cells to HIV-1 infection and regulates proviral gene expression. Signaling events initiated by CD28 that directly impact HIV-1 transcription have not been fully characterized. T cell lines expressing CD8alpha/28 chimeric receptors containing a mutation in tyrosine 173 to phenylalanine, which inhibits the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to CD28, expressed higher levels of HIV-1 following T cell activation. Whereas constitutively active PI3K decreased provirus transcription, inhibiting endogenous PI3K with specific inhibitors or by overexpressing PTEN phosphatase enhanced HIV-1 expression. PI3K-dependent inhibition required the viral Tat protein and a trans activation response region element. Tat pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that PI3K affects the formation of the Tat-associated kinase trans-activating complex. These studies demonstrate that PI3K negatively impacts HIV-1 transcription and that Tat activity is sensitive to T cell signaling events."
14524621,"Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein NS3 binds to Sm-D1, a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein associated with autoimmune disease.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes a persistent infection, chronic hepatitis, and leads to hepatocellular carcinoma. Nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) of HCV possesses protease, nucleoside triphosphatase, and helicase activities. Using the yeast two hybrid assay, we identified Sm-D1, a host protein that binds to NS3. Sm-D1 is a component of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes which are associated with autoimmune disease. Sm-D1 has Gly-Arg (GR) repeats at the C terminus, which contains dimethylarginine modified by post-translational modification and may constitute an immunoreactive determinant. Deletion mutants revealed that the C-terminal region of Sm-D1 containing the GR repeats was the binding region for NS3, and the expression feature of Sm-D1 was affected by co-expression of NS3. Immunostaining assay demonstrated that NS3 was also present in the nucleus of cells overexpressing Sm-D1, although it was usually found in cytoplasm. The localization of NS3 could change following interaction with Sm-D1 and affect the function of Sm-D1."
15607035,Systematic identification of hepatocellular proteins interacting with NS5A of the hepatitis C virus.,"The hepatitis C virus is associated with the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas. Among the 10 polyproteins produced by the virus, no function has been clearly assigned to the non-structural 5A (NS5A) protein. This study was designed to identify the hepatocellular proteins that interact with NS5A of the HCV. Yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed with a human liver cDNA prey-library, using five different NS5A derivatives as baits, the full-length NS5A (NS5A-F, amino acid (aa) 1 approximately 447) and its four different derivatives, denoted as NS5A-A (aa 1 approximately 150), -B (aa 1 approximately 300), -C (aa 300 approximately 447) and D (aa 150 approximately 447). NS5A-F, NS5A-B and NS5A-C gave two, two and 10 candidate clones, respectively, including an AHNAK-related protein, the secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4), the N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), the cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 (CRABP-1), ferritin heavy chain (FTH1), translokin, tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2), phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) and centaurindelta 2 (CENTdelta2). However, NS5A-A produced no candidates and NS5A-D was not suitable as bait due to transcriptional activity. Based on an in vitro binding assay, CRABP-1, PI4K, CENTdelta2 and two unknown fusion proteins with maltose binding protein (MBP), were confirmed to interact with the glutathione S-transferase (GST)/NS5A fusion protein. Furthermore, the interactions of CRABP-1, PI4K and CENTdelta2 were not related to the PXXP motif (class II), as judged by a domain analysis. While their biological relevance is under investigation, the results contribute to a better understanding of the possible role of NS5A in hepatocellular signaling pathways."
15722511,Herpes simplex virus type 2 membrane protein UL56 associates with the kinesin motor protein KIF1A.,"The herpes simplex virus UL56 gene product is a C-terminal-anchored, type II membrane protein of unknown function. UL56 was found to interact with KIF1A, a member of the kinesin-3 family, in a yeast two-hybrid screen and a GST pull-down assay. KIF1A mediates the transport of synaptic vesicle precursors and is essential for the function and viability of neurons. When overexpressed, KIF1A co-localized with full-sized UL56, but no clear co-localization was observed when co-expressed with the UL56 mutant protein lacking its C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD). Although the C-terminal TMD was not essential for the interaction with KIF1A in the yeast two-hybrid screen and GST pull-down assays, these results indicate that the C-terminal TMD, as well as aa 69-217, of UL56 are important for the interaction with KIF1A in vivo. The hypothesis that the UL56 protein affects vesicular trafficking in infected cells, potentially by acting as a receptor for motor proteins in neurons, is discussed."
11739688,Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C putative repression domain mediates coactivation of the LMP1 promoter with EBNA-2.,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA-3C) regulates virus and cell genes and is essential for EBV-mediated transformation of primary B lymphocytes. EBNA-3C associates with the cellular DNA sequence-specific transcription factors RBP-Jkappa and PU.1 and coactivates the EBV LMP1 promoter with EBNA-2 in BL2 and Raji cells under conditions of restrictive growth. We now find that EBNA-3C is similar to EBNA-LP in coactivating the LMP1 promoter with EBNA-2 in non-EBV-infected Burkitt lymphoma cells under conditions of maximal cell growth, whereas the EBV Cp promoter is repressed under the same conditions. EBNA-3A and EBNA-3B coactivation are at most 40% that of EBNA-3C. The RBP-Jkappa binding sites of EBNA-2 and the LMP1 promoter are not required for EBNA-3C coactivation, whereas the PU.1 site in the LMP1 promoter is required for EBNA-2-mediated activation and EBNA-3C coactivation. EBNA-3C amino acids (aa) 365 to 545, including most of the previously identified repression domain (M. Bain, R. J. Watson, P. J. Farrell, and M. J. Allday, J. Virol. 70:2481-2489, 1996), are necessary and sufficient for coactivation with wild-type EBNA-2. EBNA-3C can also coactivate with the EBNA-2 acidic activating domain; this activation does not require aa 343 to 545. These data indicate that there are at least two mechanisms by which EBNA-3C coactivates the LMP1 promoter with EBNA-2. Of the proteins that interact with EBNA-3C in a yeast two-hybrid screen, only the ubiquitin-like proteins SUMO-1 and SUMO-3/hSMT3B map to aa 365 to 545, implicating these molecules in EBNA-3C coactivation. In addition, SUMO-1 associates at a high level with EBNA-3C in lymphoblasts. Promoter coactivation by EBNA-3C is likely to be important in ensuring adequate levels of LMP1, while inhibition of the EBNA-Cp promoter under the same conditions prevents uncontrolled up-regulation of EBNA expression from a positive-feedback loop."
7778269,Identification of a novel human zinc finger protein that specifically interacts with the activation domain of lentiviral Tat proteins.,"Transcriptional activation of HIV-1 gene expression by the viral Tat protein requires the interaction of a cellular cofactor with the Tat activation domain. This domain has been shown to consist of the cysteine-rich and core motifs of HIV-1 Tat and is functionally conserved in the distantly related Tat proteins of HIV-2 and EIAV. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel human gene product, termed HT2A, that specifically and precisely binds to the activation domain of HIV-1 Tat and that can also interact with the HIV-2 and EIAV Tat proteins in vivo. We present data further demonstrating that the interaction between the activation domain of HIV-1 Tat and the HT2A protein can be readily detected in the mammalian cell nucleus. Sequence analysis demonstrates that HT2A is a novel member of the C3HC4 or ring finger family of zinc finger proteins that includes several known oncogenes and transcription factors. Overall, these data suggest that HT2A may play a significant role in mediating the biological activity of the HIV-1 Tat protein in vivo."
9169458,HIV-1 Tat induces the expression of the interleukin-6 (IL6) gene by binding to the IL6 leader RNA and by interacting with CAAT enhancer-binding protein beta (NF-IL6) transcription factors.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is associated with severe psoriasis, B cell lymphoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma. A deregulated production of interleukin-6 (IL6) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The molecular mechanisms underlying the abnormal IL6 secretion of HIV-1-infected cells may include transactivation of the IL6 gene by HIV-1. Here we report the molecular mechanisms of Tat activity on the expression of the IL6 gene. By using 5' deletion mutants of pIL6Pr-CAT and using IL6:HIV-1-LTR hybrid constructs where discrete regions of the IL6 promoter replaced the TAR sequence in HIV-1 LTR, we identified a short sequence of the 5'-untranslated region of the IL6 mRNA that is required for Tat to trans-activate the IL6 promoter. This sequence acquires a stem-loop structure and includes a UCU sequence that binds to Tat and is necessary for full trans-activation. In addition, we provide the evidence that Tat can function by enhancing the CAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) DNA binding activity and is able to complex with in vitro translated C/EBPbeta, which is a major mediator of IL6 promoter function. By using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation, we observed that the interaction of Tat with C/EBP proteins also occurred in vivo. The data are consistent with the possibility that Tat may function on heterologous genes by interacting with RNA structures possibly present in a large number of cellular and viral genes. In addition, Tat may function by protein-protein interactions, leading to the generation of heterodimers with specific transcription factors."
11275565,Tip60 is a cell-type-specific transcriptional regulator.,"Tip60 was originally identified as cellular HIV-Tat interacting protein and has been shown to augment Tat-dependent transcription. It has also been shown to interact with various cellular transcription factors and to belong to the nuclear histone acetyltransferase (HAT) family. To further elucidate the function of Tip60 and its HAT domain in transcription regulation, we compared Tip60 activity in HeLa and Jurkat T lymphoma cells. Here we show that Tip60 augments the HIV-1 Tat activity at the HIV-LTR promoter in HeLa but inhibits it in Jurkat cells. Moreover, we isolated two new variants of the Tip60 protein (Tip60Delta1, Tip60Delta2) from Jurkat cells. The Tip60Delta2 variant lacks the entire HAT domain but modulates HIV-1 Tat activity like full-length Tip60. In addition, Tip60 and the transcriptional repressor ZEB (zinc finger E box binding protein) interact specifically in the yeast two-hybrid system and additively inhibit the CD4 enhancer/promoter activity in Jurkat cells. Thus, Tip60 may function as corepressor of the ZEB protein. In summary, these data show that Tip60 functions as a cell-type-specific transcriptional regulator and that the HAT domain is not required for either transcriptional activation or inhibition. This indicates that Tip60 may function by recruiting additional cell-type-specific cofactors."
11463857,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat binding protein-1 is a transcriptional coactivator specific for TR.,"The DNA-binding domain of nuclear hormone receptors functions as an interaction interface for other transcription factors. Using the DNA-binding domain of TRbeta1 as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, we cloned the Tat binding protein-1 that was originally isolated as a protein binding to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat transactivator. Tat binding protein-1 has subsequently been identified as a member of the ATPase family and a component of the 26S proteasome. Tat binding protein-1 interacted with the DNA-binding domain but not with the ligand binding domain of TR in vivo and in vitro. TR bound to the amino-terminal portion of Tat binding protein-1 that contains a leucine zipper-like structure. In mammalian cells, Tat binding protein-1 potentiated the ligand-dependent transactivation by TRbeta1 and TRalpha1 via thyroid hormone response elements. Both the intact DNA-binding domain and activation function-2 of the TR were required for the transcriptional enhancement in the presence of Tat binding protein-1. Tat binding protein-1 did not augment the transactivation function of the RAR, RXR, PPARgamma, or ER. The intrinsic activation domain in Tat binding protein-1 resided within the carboxyl-terminal conserved ATPase domain, and a mutation of a putative ATP binding motif but not a helicase motif in the carboxyl-terminal conserved ATPase domain abolished the activation function. Tat binding protein-1 synergistically activated the TR-mediated transcription with the steroid receptor coactivator 1, p120, and cAMP response element-binding protein, although Tat binding protein-1 did not directly interact with these coactivators in vitro. In contrast, the N-terminal portion of Tat binding protein-1 directly interacted in vitro and in vivo with the TR-interacting protein 1 possessing an ATPase activity that interacts with the activation function-2 of liganded TR. Collectively, Tat binding protein-1 might function as a novel DNA-binding domain-binding transcriptional coactivator specific for the TR probably in cooperation with other activation function-2-interacting cofactors such as TR-interacting protein 1."
7682219,A novel integrin specificity exemplified by binding of the alpha v beta 5 integrin to the basic domain of the HIV Tat protein and vitronectin.,"Several studies have addressed the interaction of the HIV Tat protein with the cell surface. Our analysis of the cell attachment-promoting activity of Tat and peptides derived from it revealed that the basic domain of Tat, not the arg-gly-asp (RGD) sequence, is required for cell attachment to Tat. Affinity chromatography with Tat peptides and immunoprecipitation with various anti-integrin antibodies suggest that the vitronectin-binding integrin, alpha v beta 5, is the cell surface protein that binds to the basic domain of Tat. The Tat basic domain contains the sequence RKKRRQRRR. A related sequence, KKQRFRHRNRKG, present in the heparin-binding domain of an alpha v beta 5 ligand, vitronectin, also bound alpha v beta 5 in affinity chromatography and, in combination with an RGD peptide, was an inhibitor of cell attachment to vitronectin. The alpha v beta 5 interaction with these peptides was not solely due to high content of basic amino acids in the ligand sequences; alpha v beta 5 did not bind substantially to peptides consisting entirely of arginine or lysine, whereas a beta 1 integrin did bind to these peptides. The interaction of alpha v beta 5 with Tat is atypical for integrins in that the binding to Tat is divalent cation independent, whereas the binding of the same integrin to an RGD-containing peptide or to vitronectin requires divalent cations. These data define an auxiliary integrin binding specificity for basic amino acid sequences. These basic domain binding sites may function synergistically with the binding sites that recognize RGD or equivalent sequences."
7690421,In vitro and in vivo binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein and Sp1 transcription factor.,"Recent genetic experiments have suggested that tat transactivation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat requires functional upstream enhancer sequences--Sp1 sites, in particular. In these experiments, HeLa cell nuclear extracts were passed over affinity matrices containing chemically synthesized or bacterially expressed HIV-1 Tat. Assay of material that bound to and eluted from the Tat matrices revealed the presence of the Sp1 transcription factor. Other transcription factors (Oct and NF-kappa B) also bound to Tat matrices but with less efficiency--in parallel with the lower capacities of these binding motifs to confer Tat responsiveness on a basal HIV-1 promoter compared with Sp1 sites. Passage of nuclear extracts over matrices containing other neutral proteins, including bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and lysozyme, revealed no or reduced binding. Cross-linking experiments indicated that the purified Sp1 and Tat proteins can form multimeric complexes in the absence of other proteins. The region of Tat responsible for Sp1 binding was localized to a region encompassing residues 30 to 62. Immunoprecipitation experiments with HIV-1-infected T lymphocytes indicated coimmunoprecipitation of Tat and Sp1. These experiments extend previous genetic experiments and suggest a direct interaction between Tat and Sp1 during transactivation."
9733868,Interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat with the transcriptional coactivators p300 and CREB binding protein.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes the transactivator protein Tat, which is essential for viral replication and progression to disease. Here we demonstrate that transcriptional activation by HIV-1 Tat involves p300 or the related cellular transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP). Tat transactivation was inhibited by the 12S form of the adenovirus E1A gene product, which inhibits p300 function, and this inhibition was independent of its effect on NF-kappaB transcription. A biochemical interaction of p300 with Tat was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation. The carboxy-terminal region of p300, which binds to E1A, was shown to bind specifically to the highly conserved basic domain of Tat, which also mediates binding to the Tat-responsive region RNA stem-loop structure. The ability of Tat to interact physically and functionally with this coactivator provides a mechanism to assemble a basal transcription complex which may subsequently respond to the effect of Tat on transcriptional elongation and represents a novel interaction between an RNA binding protein and a transcriptional coactivator."
9811832,HIV-1 tat transactivator recruits p300 and CREB-binding protein histone acetyltransferases to the viral promoter.,"In cells infected with HIV type 1 (HIV-1), the integrated viral promoter is present in a chromatin-bound conformation and is transcriptionally silent in the absence of stimulation. The HIV-1 Tat protein binds to a stem-loop structure at the 5' end of viral mRNA and relieves this inhibition by inducing a remodeling of the nucleosome arrangement downstream of the transcription-initiation site. Here we show that Tat performs this activity by recruiting to the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) the transcriptional coactivator p300 and the closely related CREB-binding protein (CBP), having histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Tat associates with HAT activity in human nuclear extracts and binds to p300 and CBP both in vitro and in vivo. Integrity of the basic domain of Tat is essential for this interaction. By a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay we show that the delivery of recombinant Tat induces the association of p300 and CBP with the chromosomally integrated LTR promoter. Expression of human p300 in both human and rodent cells increases the levels of Tat transactivation of the integrated LTR. These results reinforce the evidence that p300 and CBP have a pivotal function at both cellular and viral promoters and demonstrate that they also can be recruited by an RNA-targeted activator. Additionally, these findings have important implications for the understanding of the mechanisms of HIV-1 latency and reactivation."
10823848,The double-stranded RNA-binding protein Staufen is incorporated in human immunodeficiency virus type 1: evidence for a role in genomic RNA encapsidation.,"Human Staufen (hStau), a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding protein that is involved in mRNA transport, is incorporated in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and in other retroviruses, including HIV-2 and Moloney murine leukemia virus. Sucrose and Optiprep gradient analyses reveal cosedimentation of hStau with purified HIV-1, while subtilisin assays demonstrate that it is internalized. hStau incorporation in HIV-1 is selective, is dependent on an intact functional dsRNA-binding domain, and quantitatively correlates with levels of encapsidated HIV-1 genomic RNA. By coimmunoprecipitation and reverse transcription-PCR analyses, we demonstrate that hStau is associated with HIV-1 genomic RNA in HIV-1-expressing cells and purified virus. Overexpression of hStau enhances virion incorporation levels, and a corresponding, threefold increase in HIV-1 genomic RNA encapsidation levels. This coordinated increase in hStau and genomic RNA packaging had a significant negative effect on viral infectivity. This study is the first to describe hStau within HIV-1 particles and provides evidence that hStau binds HIV-1 genomic RNA, indicating that it may be implicated in retroviral genome selection and packaging into assembling virions."
11959860,"HIV-1 Tat protein-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter is potentiated by a novel nuclear Tat-interacting protein of 110 kDa, Tip110.","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression and replication is highly dependent on and modulated by interactions between viral and host cellular factors. Tat protein, encoded by one of the HIV-1 regulatory genes, tat, is essential for HIV-1 gene expression. A number of host cellular factors have been shown to interact with Tat in this process. During our attempts to determine the molecular mechanisms of Tat interaction with brain cells, we isolated a cDNA clone that encodes a novel Tat-interacting protein of 110 kDa or Tip110 from a human fetal brain cDNA library. GenBank BLAST search revealed that Tip110 was almost identical to a previously cloned KIAA0156 gene with unknown functions. In vivo binding of Tip110 with Tat was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, in combination with mutagenesis. The yeast three-hybrid RNA-protein interaction assay indicated no direct interaction of Tip110 with Tat transactivating response element RNA. Nevertheless, Tip110 strongly synergized with Tat on Tat-mediated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene expression and HIV-1 virus production, whereas down-modulation of constitutive Tip110 expression inhibited HIV-1 virus production. Northern blot analysis showed that Tip110 mRNA was expressed in a variety of human tissues and cells. Moreover, digital fluorescence microscopic imaging revealed that Tip110 was expressed exclusively in the nucleus, and within a nuclear speckle structure that has recently been described for human cyclin T and CDK9, two critical components for Tat transactivation function on HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Tip110 regulates Tat transactivation activity through direct interaction, and suggest that Tip110 is an important cellular factor for HIV-1 gene expression and viral replication."
14634014,The structure of echovirus type 12 bound to a two-domain fragment of its cellular attachment protein decay-accelerating factor (CD 55).,"Echovirus type 12 (EV12), an Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family, uses the complement regulator decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) as a cellular receptor. We have calculated a three-dimensional reconstruction of EV12 bound to a fragment of DAF consisting of short consensus repeat domains 3 and 4 from cryo-negative stain electron microscopy data (EMD code 1057). This shows that, as for an earlier reconstruction of the related echovirus type 7 bound to DAF, attachment is not within the viral canyon but occurs close to the 2-fold symmetry axes. Despite this general similarity our reconstruction reveals a receptor interaction that is quite different from that observed for EV7. Fitting of the crystallographic co-ordinates for DAF(34) and EV11 into the reconstruction shows a close agreement between the crystal structure of the receptor fragment and the density for the virus-bound receptor, allowing unambiguous positioning of the receptor with respect to the virion (PDB code 1UPN). Our finding that the mode of virus-receptor interaction in EV12 is distinct from that seen for EV7 raises interesting questions regarding the evolution and biological significance of the DAF binding phenotype in these viruses."
7826206,Spatial association of HIV-1 tat protein and the nucleolar transport protein B23 in stably transfected Jurkat T-cells.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) encodes a transactivator protein, the product of the tat gene (tat), which is essential for virus replication. In this study, immunogold electron microscopy was used in a stably transfected Jurkat T-cell line that constitutively expresses HIV-1 tat protein to determine the subcellular and intranuclear distribution of tat protein. Two nucleocytoplasmic shuttle proteins C23/nucleolin and B23 and a third nucleolar antigen that was detected by monoclonal antibody MAb 1277 were also examined. In addition, spatial association of C23 and B23 with tat protein at several subcellular locations was examined in dual-labeling experiments. The results showed that tat protein was found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus but was especially prominent within the dense fibrillar and granular components of the nucleolus. There was little labeling of tat protein in the fibrillar centers where MAb 1277 antigen was localized at a comparatively high level. The subcellular and intranucleolar distribution of tat protein was virtually identical to the pattern seen with C23 and B23. Although the intranuclear distributions of C23, B23 and tat protein were very similar, C23 and tat protein were seldom spatially associated. In contrast, B23 and tat protein were frequently spatially associated in the nucleolus and in several other subcellular locations including the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, at the nuclear envelope and plasma membrane. While a physical association was not directly demonstrated in this study, the spatial association between B23 and tat protein strongly suggest that such an association may exist."
1351748,Accumulation of transcripts coding for prion protein in human astrocytes during infection with human immunodeficiency virus.,"The abnormal isoforms of the normal cellular prion protein (PrP), also termed Scrapie-associated fibril protein, are assumed to be one causative factor of spongiform encephalopathies. The mRNA of PrP contains stem-loop structures which are very similar to the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) cis-acting sequence TAR within the LTR; both structures contain the pentanucleotide CUGGG in the loop, and the uridine- and adenine-bulge in the stem. In this study, using purified HIV-encoded trans-activator, Tat, and HIV-1 TAR-RNA or PrP-mRNA containing the stem-loop structure, we demonstrate by use of gel-retardation and filter binding assays that Tat binds to TAR- and PrP-RNA with the dissociation constants of 2.9 or 37.0 nM, respectively, at a molar ratio of 0.7 mol of Tat to 1 mol of RNA fragment. The Tat-RNA (TAR or PrP) complexes bind to protein(s) in the nuclear matrix, isolated from human astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein positive brain cells). Infection of astrocytes with HIV-1 resulted in an increased level of PrP mRNA. The data presented led us to assume that certain sequences in the PrP mRNA might be targets for proteins acting in trans."
7600101,Expression of nuclear lectin carbohydrate-binding protein 35 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected Molt-3 cells.,"The nuclear carbohydrate-binding protein 35 (CBP35), a beta-galactoside-specific lectin with an M(r) of 35,000, has been identified in nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) from a variety of mammalian tissues and cells. Here we determined that the expression of CBP35 mRNA greatly increases after infection of Molt-3 cells with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), concomitantly with the onset of expression of the viral regulatory gene tat, and then declines. The increase in CBP35 mRNA level results in an enhanced synthesis of CBP35, as evidenced in nitrocellulose filter binding assay using radiolabeled, sugar-specific neoglycoprotein. Immunoblotting experiments showed that CBP35 is present in the 40S heterogeneous nuclear RNP complex from HIV-1-infected Molt-3 cells. CBP35 could also be detected using a novel photoreactive alpha-D-galactose probe designed for the specific detection of CBP."
14506283,"Protein interaction domains of the ubiquitin-specific protease, USP7/HAUSP.","USP7 or HAUSP is a ubiquitin-specific protease in human cells that regulates the turnover of p53 and is bound by at least two viral proteins, the ICP0 protein of herpes simplex type 1 and the EBNA1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus. We have overexpressed and purified USP7 and shown that the purified protein is monomeric and is active for cleaving both a linear ubiquitin substrate and conjugated ubiquitin on EBNA1. Using partial proteolysis of USP7 coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we showed that USP7 comprises four structural domains; an N-terminal domain known to bind p53, a catalytic domain, and two C-terminal domains. By passing a mixture of USP7 domains over EBNA1 and ICP0 affinity columns, we showed that the N-terminal p53 binding domain was also responsible for the EBNA1 interaction, while the ICP0 binding domain mapped to a C-terminal domain between amino acids 599-801. Tryptophan fluorescence assays showed that an EBNA1 peptide mapping to residues 395-450 was sufficient to bind the USP7 N-terminal domain and did so with a dissociation constant of 0.9-2 microM, whereas p53 peptides spanning the USP7-binding region gave dissociation constants of 9-17 microM in the same assay. In keeping with these relative affinities, gel filtration analyses of the complexes showed that the EBNA1 peptide efficiently competed with the p53 peptide for USP7 binding, suggesting that EBNA1 could affect p53 function in vivo by competing for USP7."
9057648,Upregulation of c-Fos in activated T lymphoid and monocytic cells by human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein.,"The regulatory Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is essential for viral replication and also shows pleiotropic activities on various cell functions. To get further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of Tat, we investigated the effect of endogenous and exogenous Tat protein on c-fos gene expression in T lymphoblastoid (Jurkat) and monocytic (U937) cell lines, as well as in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Transient cotransfection of tat cDNA in sense orientation (tat/S), together with a plasmid containing the c-fos promoter (FC3, from -711 to +42) in front of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene significantly enhanced CAT activity in Jurkat cells activated by the addition of 15% fetal calf serum (FCS) or 5 micrograms/mL phytohemagglutinin plus 10(-7) mol/L phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and U937 cells activated by 15% FCS or 10(-7) mol/L PMA. This effect was specifically due to Tat, since Jurkat and U937 cells cotransfected either with tat cDNA in antisense orientation (tat/AS), tat carrying a mutation in the aminoacid cys22-gly22 (tat 22/S) or with the backbone vector alone (pRPneo-SL3) did not show any significant difference in c-fos promoter activity as compared to cells transfected with FC3 plasmid alone. By using deletion mutants of the c-fos promoter, we found that the minimal DNA sequence required for Tat activity was located between nucleotides -404/-220 and that the serum responsive element (SRE, -317/-288), present within this region, was still responsive to Tat. A single point mutation in the SRE completely abrogated the responsiveness to tat/S. Exogenous recombinant Tat protein was also able to upregulate c-fos promoter activity in serum-activated Jurkat and U937 cells, as well as endogenous c-fos mRNA expression and c-Fos protein synthesis in both serum-activated cell lines and primary PBMC. c-Fos protein was shown essential for an optimal transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by Tat: incubation of Jurkat cells with antisense, but not sense, c-fos oligonucleotides significantly reduced either the Tat-enhanced expression of an LTR-CAT reporter construct or the levels of gag p24 in the culture supernatants of Jurkat cells and PBMC acutely infected with HIV-1. Our data suggest that the c-fos upregulation mediated by Tat might play a significant role in the control of viral gene transactivation."
15808506,Structure of the p53 binding domain of HAUSP/USP7 bound to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 implications for EBV-mediated immortalization.,"USP7/HAUSP is a key regulator of p53 and Mdm2 and is targeted by the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We have determined the crystal structure of the p53 binding domain of USP7 alone and bound to an EBNA1 peptide. This domain is an eight-stranded beta sandwich similar to the TRAF-C domains of TNF-receptor associated factors, although the mode of peptide binding differs significantly from previously observed TRAF-peptide interactions in the sequence (DPGEGPS) and the conformation of the bound peptide. NMR chemical shift analyses of USP7 bound by EBNA1 and p53 indicated that p53 binds the same pocket as EBNA1 but makes less extensive contacts with USP7. Functional studies indicated that EBNA1 binding to USP7 can protect cells from apoptotic challenge by lowering p53 levels. The data provide a structural and conceptual framework for understanding how EBNA1 might contribute to the survival of Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells."
9374514,The N-terminal structure of HIV-1 Tat is required for suppression of CD26-dependent T cell growth.,"Evidence exists that the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transactivator Tat occurs extracellularly and is involved in the immunosuppression of non-HIV-1-infected T cells of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The mechanism of this immunosuppressive activity of Tat has been controversially discussed. Interestingly, Tat binds to the T cell activation marker CD26, which has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of growth of lymphocytes and to inhibit its dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) activity. Here we show that the N-terminal nonapeptide MDPVDPNIE of Tat is a competitive inhibitor of DP IV and suppresses DNA synthesis of tetanus toxoid-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Amino acid exchanges at positions 5 and 6 strongly weaken these effects. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulations of Tat(1-9), I5-Tat(1-9), and L6-Tat(1-9) suggest a similar backbone conformation for Tat(1-9) and L6-Tat(1-9). The solution conformation of I5-Tat(1-9) considerably differs from the other two. However, Tat(1-9) fits into our previously proposed active site model of DP IV in contrast to I5-Tat(1-9) and L6-Tat(1-9). Conformational alterations with regard to the parent peptide and spatial hindrances between these both compounds and DP IV can explain the loss of inhibitory activity. Our data suggest that the N-terminal residues of HIV-1 Tat do interact directly with the active site of DP IV and that DP IV does mediate Tat's immunosuppressive effects."
11549886,Binding of phage-displayed HIV-1 Tat to TAR RNA in the presence of cyclin T1.,"The transactivator protein (Tat) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a key regulatory protein in the viral replication cycle. Together with cellular cyclin T1 and an RNA element (transactivation response; TAR) located at the 5' end of all viral transcripts, it forms a ternary complex that ultimately enhances the expression of all viral genes. In this ternary complex, cyclin T1 interacts directly with Tat and TAR. The presence of cyclin T1 is essential for high TAR RNA affinity and specificity of Tat. To study protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction, we developed a phage display system that displays functional Tat on the surface of bacteriophage M13. The addition of recombinant cyclin T1 to the selections yielded a phage display system that mirrors all binding properties of the cyclin T1-Tat-TAR complex known from cell assays and biochemical studies. Phage-displayed Tat protein as well as the cyclin T1 are fully functional. The relative binding capabilities of wild-type- and mutant Tat-displaying phages show that the presence of cyclin T1 significantly reduces the importance of basic residues in the basic sequence region of Tat for its binding to TAR."
7491766,"HIV-1 Tat directly interacts with the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase, PKR.","We present evidence that the HIV-1 Tat protein and the RNA-dependent cellular protein kinase, PKR, interact with each other both in vitro and in vivo. Using GST fusion chromatography, we demonstrate that PKR, interacts directly with the HIV-1 Tat protein. The region in Tat sufficient for binding PKR maps within amino acids 20 to 72. In in vitro assays, the two-exon form of Tat (Tat 86) was phosphorylated by PKR, while the one exon form of Tat (Tat 72) inhibited PKR autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation. The ability of Tat to interact with PKR was demonstrated in both yeast and mammalian cells. Expression of PKR in yeast results in a growth suppressor phenotype which was reversed by coexpression of a one exon form of Tat. Expression of Tat 72 in HeLa cells resulted in direct interaction with PKR as detected by coimmunprecipitation with a Tat antibody. Tat and PKR also form a coimmunoprecipitable complex in cell-free extracts prepared from productively infected T lymphocytes. The interaction of Tat with PKR provides a potential mechanism by which HIV could suppress the interferon system."
8121496,Direct interaction of human TFIID with the HIV-1 transactivator tat.,"The tat gene of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) plays a central role in the activation and life cycle of HIV. The tat protein (Tat) specifically transactivates HIV transcription in vivo and in vitro, exerting its effects at the level of transcriptional initiation and elongation. Here we report that Tat binds directly to the basal transcription factor TFIID. The transcriptional activity of HeLa extracts was depleted after chromatography on a Tat affinity column, which specifically retained the polymerase II-specific factor TFIID. Direct interaction of Tat with holo-TFIID, composed of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and associated factors (TAFs), was observed. Tat binds, through amino acids 36-50, directly to the TBP subunit of TFIID. Our results suggest that Tat may transduce upstream or downstream regulatory signals by direct interaction with the basal transcription factor TFIID."
8764062,Interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat with a unique site of TFIID inhibits negative cofactor Dr1 and stabilizes the TFIID-TFIIA complex.,"We have previously reported the direct physical interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type I Tat protein and the basal transcription factor TBP/TFIID. Affinity chromatography demonstrated that wild-type Tat, but not a transactivation mutant of Tat, was capable of depleting TBP/TFIID from cell extracts. These experiments represented the first demonstration of a basal transcription factor that binds, in an activation-dependent manner, to Tat. We now report that the Tat-TBP interaction can be detected in HIV type 1-infected cells. The domain of TBP interacting with Tat has been mapped from amino acids 163 to 196 by using deletion and site-specific mutants of TBP. This domain of TBP, which includes the HI and S2 domains, is distinct from the H2 binding site for other activator proteins, such as E1A. The interaction of Tat with TFIID regulates the binding of accessory proteins to TFIID. Tat stabilizes the interaction of TFIID with TFIIA in a gel shift assay. In addition, Tat competes for Dr1 interaction with TBP. Our results suggest that the basal transcription factor TBP/TFIID represents an important regulatory molecule in HIV transcription."
9121429,The human immunodeficiency virus transactivator Tat interacts with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encodes a transcriptional transactivator (Tat), which binds to an RNA hairpin called the transactivation response element (TAR) that is located downstream of the site of initiation of viral transcription. Tat stimulates the production of full-length viral transcripts by RNA polymerase II (pol II). In this study, we demonstrate that Tat coimmunoprecipitates with the pol II holoenzyme in cells and that it binds to the purified holoenzyme in vitro. Furthermore, Tat affinity chromatography purifies a holoenzyme from HeLa nuclear extracts which, upon addition of TBP and TFIIB, supports Tat transactivation in vitro, indicating that it contains all the cellular proteins required for the function of Tat. By demonstrating that Tat interacts with the holoenzyme in the absence of TAR, our data suggest a single-step assembly of Tat and the transcription complex on the long terminal repeat of HIV."
9342064,HIV-1 Tat protein exits from cells via a leaderless secretory pathway and binds to extracellular matrix-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans through its basic region.,To analyze the mechanisms of release and the extracellular fate of the HIV-1 Tat protein and to determine the Tat domain binding to the extracellular matrix.
9765201,The HIV-1 Tat cellular coactivator Tat-SF1 is a general transcription elongation factor.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein strongly and specifically stimulates transcription elongation from the HIV-1 LTR and provides an important in vitro model system to study this process. Here we use protein-affinity chromatography to identify cellular factors involved in transcription elongation. A Tat-affinity column bound one transcription factor, Tat-SF1, efficiently and selectively. Tat-SF1 was identified originally as a Tat-specific coactivator, but we show it is a general transcription elongation factor. Our results also reveal the existence of an ATP-inactivatable general elongation factor (AIEF) required for Tat-SF1 activity and for which Tat can substitute functionally."
10964778,An in vitro transcription system that recapitulates equine infectious anemia virus tat-mediated inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat activity demonstrates a role for positive transcription elongation factor b and associated proteins in the mechanism of Tat activation.,"Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) activates transcription via a Tat protein, a TAR element, and the equine elongation factor positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). In human cells, EIAV Tat (eTat) can inhibit the ability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat (hTat) to activate transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, demonstrating that EIAV Tat can interact nonproductively with human P-TEFb. To study the mechanism of EIAV Tat and HIV-1 Tat activation, we developed an in vitro elongation assay that recapitulates EIAV Tat-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 Tat trans-activation. We found that eTat specifically inhibits activation of elongation by HIV-1 Tat while having no effect on basal transcription elongation. The competitive inhibition of hTat activation was reversed by an activity present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts, most likely a form of P-TEFb. Recombinant P-TEFb (cyclin T1 and CDK9) overcame the inhibition of transcription by eTat but in a nonspecific manner. EIAV Tat affinity chromatography was used to purify the activity present in nuclear extract that was capable of reversing eTat inhibition. We characterized the protein components of this activity, which include cyclin T1, CDK9, Tat-SF1, and at least three unidentified proteins. These data suggest that additional factors are involved in the mechanism of Tat activation."
10225209,HIV-1 regulatory protein tat induces RNA binding proteins in central nervous system cells that associate with the viral trans-acting-response regulatory motif.,"To investigate some of the cellular consequences of HIV-1 Tat expression in human astrocytic cells. This study is based on evidence that cellular factors play a critical role in facilitating transcriptional activation by Tat through its interaction with the trans-acting-response (TAR) RNA element and upstream HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter binding site. STUDY DESIGN-METHODS: Using the previously established astrocytic cell line of human origin stably transfected with Tat cDNA, we analyzed the formation of a nucleoprotein complex consisting of three cellular proteins associated with TAR RNA using ultraviolet (UV) crosslinking and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays."
11739381,Enhancement of nuclear factor-kappa B acetylation by coactivator p300 and HIV-1 Tat proteins.,"Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcription factors are involved in the control of a large number of normal cellular and organismal processes, such as immune and inflammatory responses, developmental processes, cellular growth, and apoptosis. Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome depends on the intracellular environment where the integrate viral DNA is regulated by a complex interplay among viral regulatory proteins, such as Tat, and host cellular transcription factors, such as NF-kappaB, interacting with the viral long terminal repeat region. CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300, containing an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, have emerged as coactivators for various DNA-binding transcription factors. Here, we show that the p50 subunit as well as the p50/p65 of NF-kappaB, and not other factors such as SP1, TFIIB, polymerase II, TFIIA, or p65, can be acetylated by CBP/p300 HAT domain. Acetylation of p50 was completely dependent on the presence of both HAT domain and Tat proteins, implying that Tat influences the transcription machinery by aiding CBP/p300 to acquire new partners and increase its functional repertoire. Three lysines, Lys-431, Lys-440, and Lys-441 in p50 were all acetylated in vitro, and a sequence similarity among p50, p53, Tat, and activin receptor type I on these particular lysines was observed. All proteins have been shown to be acetylated by the CBP/p300 HAT domain. Acetylated p50 increases its DNA binding properties, as evident by streptavidin/biotin pull-down assays when using labeled NF-kappaB oligonucleotides. Increased DNA binding on HIV-1 long terminal repeat coincided with increases in the rate of transcription. Therefore, we propose that acetylation of the DNA binding domain of NF-kappaB aids in nuclear translocation and enhanced transcription and also suggest that the substrate specificity of CBP/p300 can be altered by small peptide molecules, such as HIV-encoded Tat."
15537660,Allele-dependent similarity between viral and self-peptide presentation by HLA-B27 subtypes.,"Molecular mimicry is discussed as a possible mechanism that may contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. It could also be involved in the differential association of the human major histocompatibility subtypes HLA-B(*)2705 and HLA-B(*)2709 with ankylosing spondylitis. These two subtypes differ only in residue 116 of the heavy chain (Asp in B(*)2705 and His in B(*)2709), but the reason for the differential disease association is not understood. Using x-ray crystallography, we show here that the viral peptide pLMP2 (RRRWRRLTV, derived from latent membrane protein 2 (residues 236-244) of Epstein-Barr virus) is presented by the B(*)2705 and B(*)2709 molecules in two drastically deviating conformations. Extensive structural similarity between pLMP2 and the self-peptide pVIPR (RRKWRRWHL, derived from vasoactive intestinal peptide type 1 receptor (residues 400-408)) is observed only when the peptides are presented by B(*)2705 because of a salt bridge between Arg(5) of both peptides and the subtype-specific heavy chain residue Asp(116). Combined with functional studies using pLMP2/pVIPR-cross-reactive cytotoxic T cell lines and clones, together with target cells presenting these peptides or a modified peptide analogue, our results reveal that a pathogen-derived peptide can exhibit major histocompatibility complex class I subtype-dependent, drastically distinct binding modes. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that molecular mimicry between pLMP2 and pVIPR in the HLA-B27 context is an allele-dependent property."
11160671,Cell cycle regulation of human interleukin-8 gene expression by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein has been reported to transactivate several cellular genes, including the potent chemotactic factor interleukin-8 (IL-8). Consistent with these in vitro assays, elevated levels of IL-8 protein are found in the serum of HIV-infected individuals. We now extend these observations by demonstrating that Tat induction of IL-8 is linked to the cell cycle. Cells that constitutively express the Tat(1-86) protein (eTat) and control cells (pCEP) were reversibly blocked at the G(1)/S border with hydroxyurea or thymidine. The cells were subsequently released, and IL-8 expression was monitored by RNase protection assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RNase protection assays demonstrated that IL-8 mRNA expression is transiently induced, approximately fourfold, as the Tat-expressing cells enter S phase. Consistent with the RNase protection assay, an increase in IL-8 protein was observed in the cell supernatant using an IL-8 ELISA. Similar experiments were performed following a reversible block at the G(2)/M border with nocodazole and release into G(1). Using the RNase protection assay and ELISA, little or no increase in IL-8 expression was observed during G(1). Using gel shift as well as an immobilized DNA binding assay, we demonstrate that the increase in IL-8 gene expression correlates with a specific increase in p65 NF-kappa B binding activity only in the nucleus of the Tat-expressing cells. Moreover, the CREB-binding protein coactivator is present in the complex in the Tat cell line. Finally, we demonstrate that the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 inhibits the induction of NF-kappa B binding, as well as IL-8 expression, supporting the role of NF-kappa B."
8257632,"Activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat by BTEB, a GC box-binding transcription factor.","BTEB, a GC box-binding transcription factor, was tested for its ability to activate the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat (HIV-1 LTR). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated specific binding of BTEB to GC boxes of the HIV-1 LTR. When a BTEB expression vector was cotransfected into A3.01 cells with a fusion gene of HIV-1 LTR and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) structural gene, the CAT activity was increased. This increase was accompanied by an increase in the content of CAT mRNA. Transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR, stimulated by Tat, was further enhanced by the expression of BTEB. BTEB also activated the LTR activity in cooperation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Northern blot analysis showed that various T cell and macrophage/monocyte cell lines expressed the BTEB mRNA to a level comparable with that of Sp1, another GC box-binding transcription factor. These results suggest that BTEB, like Sp1, is involved in transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR."
9383706,Identification of a cellular protein that binds to Tat-responsive element of TGF beta-1 promoter in glial cells.,"Tat is a transcriptional transactivator produced by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and plays a pivotal role in enhancing expression of the viral genome in the infected cells. Although initial studies have suggested that interaction of Tat with the transactivation responsive element (TAR); located within the LTR, is essential for Tat function, subsequent studies indicated that Tat has the ability to augment transcription of viral and cellular genes by a TAR-independent mechanism. In early studies we demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat stimulates transcription of the transforming growth factor, TGF beta-1, gene in glial cells. In this study, we have identified a cellular protein that interacts with the Tat-responsive region located between nucleotides -323 to -453 of the regulatory sequence of the TGF beta-1 promoter. Results from footprinting analysis revealed association of cellular proteins with the 130 nucleotide sequence located in the Tat-responsive region. Analysis of the associated protein by UV-crosslinking suggested the involvement of a protein between 40-45 kDa in size which preferentially interacts with the GC/GA rich sequence of the TGF beta-1 Tat-responsive sequence in a single-stranded configuration. The ability of the previously identified 40 kDa protein, named Pur alpha to bind to the GC/GA sequence in the single-stranded configuration, similar to those from TGF beta-1 promoter prompted us to investigate its binding capacity to the TGF beta-1 sequence and its transcriptional activity on the TGF beta-1 promoter. Results from band shift studies indicated the association of the bacterially produced Pur alpha to the TGF beta-1 DNA sequences positioned within the Tat-responsive region. Overexpression of Pur alpha in glial cells constitutively producing Tat augmented transcription of the TGF beta-1 gene. These results are consistent with previous reports on the cooperative action of Pur alpha and Tat in modulating other eukaryotic promoters. The importance of these findings with regard to deregulation of other cellular genes by HIV-1 Tat is discussed."
9472608,Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) promoter in central nervous system cells: effect of YB-1 on expression of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat.,"Transcription of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is regulated by a series of host DNA-binding proteins which interact with the upstream viral promoter sequences, and the viral regulatory protein Tat which associates with TAR RNA sequences located in the leader of the viral transcript. Here we have examined the ability of the cellular protein YB-1 to modulate transcription of the HIV-1 promoter in a human astrocytic cell line (U-87MG), a neuronal cell line (SK-N-MC) and lymphoid cells (Jurkat) by transfection assay. Ectopic expression of YB-1 in U-87MG and SK-N-MC augments basal transcriptional activity of the viral sequence located between -80 and -43, which encompasses the GC-rich motif. In accord with the previous report, in Jurkat cells YB-1-mediated activation of the HIV-1 promoter required sequences which are located further upstream from the GC-rich motif. Combined overexpression of YB-1 and the GC-rich binding protein, SP1, in the transfected cells decreased the level of activation of the viral promoter, suggesting that YB-1 and SP1 may exert negative effects on each other's function. Results from band shift assay with purified YB-1 and SP1 indicated that SP1 and YB-1 bind to the GC-rich DNA sequence in the double-stranded and single-stranded configurations, respectively. However, efficient binding of SP1 to the double-stranded GC-rich motif corresponding to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) is diminished in the presence of YB-1. Similarly, in the presence of SP1, YB-1 loses its ability to become associated with its target single-stranded DNA probe. No evidence for direct association of YB-1 and SP1 either in the presence or in the absence of DNA was observed. These data suggest that while YB-1 stimulates expression of the LTR in central nervous system cells, the level of activity of other cellular proteins, such as SP1, may dictate binding of YB-1 to its target sequence, and therefore affect the regulatory function of this protein."
9517987,Hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-2 activates transcription from HIV-1 long terminal repeat.,"To study the role of the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-2 in long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed transcriptional activation of HIV-1 in hematopoietic progenitor cells, and to investigate possible GATA-2 binding sites in HIV-1 LTR."
2657100,Role of SP1-binding domains in in vivo transcriptional regulation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat.,"Five regions of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) have been shown to be important in the transcriptional regulation of HIV in HeLa cells. These include the negative regulatory, enhancer, SP1, TATA, and TAR regions. Previous studies in which purified SP1 was used showed that the three SP1-binding sites in the HIV LTR were important in the in vitro transcription of this promoter. However, no studies to ascertain the role of each of these SP1-binding sites in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation in vivo have been reported. To determine the role of SP1 sites in transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR in vivo, these sites were subjected to oligonucleotide mutagenesis both individually and in groups. The constructs were tested by DNase I footprinting with both oligonucleotide affinity column-purified SP1 and partially purified HeLa extract and by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in both the presence and absence of the tat gene. Mutagenesis of each SP1-binding site resulted in minimal changes in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation. Mutations involving alterations of SP1 sites I and II, I and III, or II and III also resulted in minimal decreases in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation. However, mutagenesis of all three SP1-binding sites resulted in a marked decrease in tat induction. The latter mutation also greatly decreased DNase I protection over the enhancer, TATA, and TAR regions when partially purified HeLa nuclear extract was used. Mutagenesis of the HIV LTR SP1 sites which converted them to consensus high-affinity SP1-binding sites with the sequence GGGGCGGGGC resulted in increased tat-induced gene expression compared with the wild-type HIV LTR template. These results suggest that SP1, through its interaction with other DNA-binding proteins, is critical for in vivo transcriptional regulation of HIV."
8289330,Transcription factor PRDII-BF1 activates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene expression.,"Gene expression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is modulated by both cellular transcription factors, which bind to cis-acting regulatory elements in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and the viral transactivator, tat. The enhancer element in the HIV-1 LTR which extends from -103 to -82 is critical for gene expression. This region contains two identical 10-bp direct repeats which serve as binding sites for members of the NF-kappa B family of transcription factors. However, several other cellular transcription factors, including a group of zinc finger DNA-binding proteins, also bind to NF-kappa B and related motifs. A member of this family of transcription factors, designated PRDII-BF1 or MBP-1, is a 300-kDa cellular protein which contains two widely separated zinc finger DNA binding domains. Each of these binding domains is capable of binding to NF-kappa B or related recognition motifs. Since no functional role for this protein has been demonstrated in the regulation of viral and cellular promoters, we began studies to determine whether PRDII-BF1 could modulate HIV-1 gene expression. DNase I footprinting of the HIV-1 LTR indicated that PRDII-BF1 bound to both NF-kappa B and TAR transactivation response DNA elements. Both in vitro translation and vaccinia virus expression of PRDII-BF1 cDNA resulted in the synthesis of the full-length 300-kDa PRDII-BF1 protein. Transfection experiments, using both eucaryotic expression vectors and antisense constructs, indicated that PRDII-BF1 activated HIV-1 gene expression in both the presence and absence of tat. These results are consistent with a role for PRDII-BF1 in activating HIV-1 gene expression."
8537364,A unique thyroid hormone response element in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat that overlaps the Sp1 binding sites.,"Long terminal repeat (LTR) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 is activated by thyroid hormone (T3) receptor alpha (T3R alpha) in the absence of ligand. Addition of T3 reverses this effect. This activity is mediated by a high affinity T3 response element (T3RE) within the HIV-1 LTR, termed the HIV-T3RE (bases -74 to -50), which coincides with the Sp1 element as demonstrated by mobility shift, DNaseI footprinting, and methylation interference analyses. HIV-T3RE mediates ligand-independent activation of transcription by T3R alpha when linked to a heterologous promoter. In addition, the viral transactivator Tat synergizes with T3R alpha to activate the HIV-1 LTR in the absence of T3, which is relieved in its presence. These findings have implications for the possible control of HIV-1 LTR activity by T3."
8676466,Activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB by the Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"A recombinant Tat protein was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Liposome-mediated delivery of this protein to responsive cells results in dose-dependent LTR activation. As evaluated by mRNA quantitation with competitive PCR, the activation response is rapid and transient, peaking at 5 h after the beginning of Tat treatment. In vivo footprinting experiments at the LTR showed that transcriptional activation is concomitant with a modification of the protein-DNA interaction pattern at the downstream kappaB site of the enhancer and at the adjacent Sp1 boxes. The effects of Tat on the enhancer are mediated by Tat-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, which parallels the kinetics of transcriptional activation. This induction results from degradation of the inhibitor IkappaB-alpha, is blocked under antioxidant conditions and by a protease inhibitor, and occurs as a rapid response in different cell types. The functional response to Tat is impaired upon cell treatment with a kappaB site decoy or with sodium salicylate, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation. These results show that NF-kappaB activation by Tat is important for LTR transcriptional activation. Furthermore, they suggest that some of the pleiotropic effects of Tat on cellular functions can be mediated by induction of NF-kappaB."
10648795,Recognition of 5'-terminal TAR structure in human immunodeficiency virus-1 mRNA by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2.,"TAR, a 59 nt 5'-terminal hairpin in human immuno-deficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) mRNA, binds viral Tat and several cellular proteins. We report that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) recognizes TAR. TAR and the AUG initiation codon domain, located well downstream from TAR, both contribute to the affinity of HIV-1 mRNA for eIF2. The affinity of TAR for eIF2 was insensitive to lower stem mutations that modify sequence and structure or to sequence changes throughout the remainder that leave the TAR secondary structure intact. Hence, eIF2 recognizes structure rather than sequence in TAR. The affinity for eIF2 was severely reduced by a 3 nt change that converts the single A bulge into a 7 nt internal loop. T1 footprinting showed that eIF2 protects nucleotides in the loop as well as in the strand opposite the A bulge. Thus, eIF2 recognizes the TAR loop and lower part of the sub-apical stem. Though not contiguous, these regions are brought into proximity in TAR by a bend in the helical structure induced by the UCU bulge; binding of eIF2 opens up the bulge context and apical stem. The ability to bind eIF2 suggests a function for TAR in HIV-1 mRNA translation. Indeed, the 3 nt change that reduces the affinity of TAR for eIF2 impairs the ability of reporter mRNA to compete in translation. Interaction of TAR with eIF2 thus allows HIV-1 mRNA to compete more effectively during protein synthesis."
11413364,Coordinate effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protein Tat and cellular protein Puralpha on DNA replication initiated at the JC virus origin.,"JC virus (JCV) causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a demyelinating disease in brains of individuals with AIDS. Previous work has shown that the Tat protein, encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), can interact with cellular protein Puralpha to enhance both TAR-dependent HIV-1 transcription and JCV late gene transcription. Tat has been shown to activate JCV transcription through interaction with Puralpha, which binds to promoter sequence elements near the JCV origin of replication. DNA footprinting has shown that Puralpha and large T-antigen cooperatively interact at several binding sites in the origin and transcriptional control region. Overexpression of Puralpha inhibits replication initiated at the JCV origin by T-antigen. In transfected glial cells Tat reversed this inhibition and enhanced DNA replication. In an in vitro replication system maximal activation by Tat, more than sixfold the levels achieved with T-antigen alone, was achieved in the presence of Puralpha. Effects of mutant Tat proteins on both activation of replication and binding to Puralpha have revealed that Cys22 exerts a conformational effect that affects both activities. The origin of an archetypal strain of JCV was less susceptible to activation of replication by Tat relative to the rearranged Mad-1 strain. These results have revealed a previously undocumented role for Tat in DNA replication and have indicated a regulatory role for JCV origin auxiliary sequences in replication and activation by Tat."
8724035,Enhanced nuclear factor-kappa B activation induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha in stably tat-transfected cells is associated with the presence of cell-surface-bound Tat protein.,"An enhanced nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activation in response to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha has been observed in stably tat-transfected cells. Recent experimental evidence suggests that Tat may autocrinously influence both cellular physiology and HIV-1 long terminal repeat-directed gene expression in Tat-producing cells. Therefore, the possible association of a Tat autocrinous loop with the enhanced NF-kappa B-binding activity induced by TNF-alpha in Tat-producing cells was studied by anti-Tat antibody blocking experiments."
9430704,The HIV-1 Tat nuclear localization sequence confers novel nuclear import properties.,"The different classes of conventional nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) resemble one another in that NLS-dependent nuclear protein import is energy-dependent and mediated by the cytosolic NLS-binding importin/karyopherin subunits and monomeric GTP-binding protein Ran/TC4. Based on analysis of the nuclear import kinetics mediated by the NLS of the human immunodeficiency virus accessory protein Tat using in vivo and in vitro nuclear transport assays and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we report a novel nuclear import pathway. We demonstrate that the Tat-NLS, not recognized by importin 58/97 subunits as shown using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay, is sufficient to target the 476-kDa heterologous beta-galactosidase protein to the nucleus in ATP-dependent but cytosolic factor-independent fashion. Excess SV40 large tumor antigen (T-ag) NLS-containing peptide had no significant effect on the nuclear import kinetics implying that the Tat-NLS was able to confer nuclear accumulation through a pathway distinct from conventional NLS-dependent pathways. Nucleoplasmic accumulation of the Tat-NLS-beta-galactosidase fusion protein, in contrast to that of a T-ag-NLS-containing fusion protein, also occurred in the absence of an intact nuclear envelope, implying that the Tat-NLS conferred binding to nuclear components. This is in stark contrast to known NLSs such as those of T-ag which confer nuclear entry rather than retention. Significantly, the ability to accumulate in the nucleus in the absence of an intact nuclear envelope was blocked in the absence of ATP, as well as by nonhydrolyzable ATP and GTP analogs, demonstrating that ATP is required to effect release from a complex with insoluble cytoplasmic components. Taken together, the results demonstrate that, dependent on ATP for release from cytoplasmic retention, the Tat-NLS is able to confer nuclear entry and binding to nuclear components. These unique properties indicate that Tat accumulates in the nucleus through a novel import pathway."
10679817,Interaction of HIV-1 Tat with Puralpha in nuclei of human glial cells: characterization of RNA-mediated protein-protein binding.,"A complex between the Tat protein, encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and the cellular protein, Puralpha, has been implicated in activation of the late promoter of JC virus (JCV) and in enhancement of JCV DNA replication. JCV is the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) opportunistic infection of the brain. Puralpha also binds the HIV-1 TAR RNA element and activates HIV-1 transcription, suggesting a role for RNA binding in the action of this protein. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we find that in human glial cells expressing both proteins, Tat and Puralpha are colocalized in extranucleolar chromatin structural elements. The colocalized Puralpha and Tat are nearly exclusively nuclear, although individual proteins can be seen in both nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting a preferential tropism of the complex for the nucleus. Analysis of the interaction between purified proteins indicates that the Tat-Puralpha interaction is strongly enhanced by the presence of RNA. Tat amino acids from 37-48 are essential for Tat binding. Residues 49-72, including the TAR RNA-binding domain, are critical for binding to Puralpha, while Cys(22), in the Tat transactivation domain, is responsible for an important global effect. Puralpha repeat II domains are involved in the interaction, and a polypeptide based on one such sequence inhibits binding. After RNase treatment of Puralpha enhancement of Tat binding can be partially restored by addition of a single-stranded JCV DNA PUR element, to which Tat does not bind. The results indicate that the Tat-Puralpha interaction is direct, rather than through an RNA link, and that RNA binding configures Puralpha for optimal interaction with Tat."
11282025,The Cdk9 and cyclin T subunits of TAK/P-TEFb localize to splicing factor-rich nuclear speckle regions.,"TAK/P-TEFb is an elongation factor for RNA polymerase II-directed transcription that is thought to function by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. TAK/P-TEFb is composed of Cdk9 and cyclin T and serves as the cellular cofactor for the human immunodeficiency virus transactivator Tat protein. In this study, we examined the subcellular distribution of Cdk9 and cyclin T1 using high resolution immunofluorescence microscopy and found that Cdk9 and cyclin T1 localized throughout the non-nucleolar nucleoplasm, with increased signal present at numerous foci. Both Cdk9 and cyclin T1 showed only limited colocalization with different phosphorylated forms of RNA polymerase II. However, significant colocalization with antibodies to several splicing factors that identify nuclear 'speckles' was observed for Cdk9 and especially for cyclin T1. The pattern of Cdk9 and cyclin T1 distribution was altered in cells treated with transcription inhibitors. Transient expression of cyclin T1 deletion mutants indicated that a region in the central portion of cyclin T1 is important for accumulation at speckles. Furthermore, cyclin T1 proteins that accumulated at speckles were capable of recruiting Cdk9 and the HIV Tat protein to this compartment in overexpression experiments. These results suggest that cyclin T1 functions to recruit its binding partners to nuclear speckles and raises the possibility that nuclear speckles are a site of TAK/P-TEFb function."
11833470,[HIV-1 Tat protein induces IL-10 production by human monocytes: implications of the PKC and calcium pathway].,"In asymptomatic patients infected by HIV-1, the level of IL-10, a cytokine with immunosuppressive activity, is associated with the course of HIV infection towards AIDS. We show that HIV-1 Tat, a viral protein secreted by infected cells, induces IL-10 production by human peripheral blood monocytes. The analysis of the signal transduction pathways strongly suggests that the protein kinase C may play an essential role in this induction. Stimulation by Tat induces nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFkB the activation of which seems to be necessary for IL-10 production. Using microspectrofluorimetry and confocal microscopy, we also show that Tat induces a calcium influx."
7707527,Molecular cloning and characterization of a cellular protein that interacts with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat transactivator and encodes a strong transcriptional activation domain.,"The mechanism by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat transactivates the long terminal repeat promoter is not understood. It is generally believed that Tat has one or more transcription factors as its cellular target. One might expect a cellular target for Tat to possess several properties, including (i) the ability to bind to the Tat activation region, (ii) the possession of a transcriptional activation domain, and (iii) the ability to contact the cellular transcription machinery. Here we describe the cloning, expression, and characterization of a human protein, termed TAP (Tat-associated protein), which possesses some of these properties. TAP is highly conserved in eukaryotes and is expressed in a variety of human tissues. The major intracellular species of TAP is a highly acidic 209-amino-acid protein that likely is formed by removal of a highly basic 70-amino-acid N-terminal segment from a primary translation product. By deletion analysis, we have identified a TAP C-terminal region rich in acidic amino acids and leucine residues which acts as a strong transcriptional activator when bound through GAL4 sites upstream of the core long terminal repeat promoter, as well as flanking sequences that mask the activation function. Amino acid substitution of two leucine residues within the core activation region results in loss of the TAP activation function. Two lines of evidence suggest that Tat interacts with TAP in vivo. First, promoter-bound Tat can recruit a TAP/VP16 fusion protein to the promoter. Second, transiently expressed Tat is found associated with endogenous TAP, as demonstrated by coimmuno-precipitation analysis. As shown in an accompanying report, the TAP activation region binds the Tat core activation region and general transcription factor TFIIB (L. Yu, P.M. Loewenstein, Z. Zhang, and M. Green, J. Virol. 69:3017-3023, 1995). These combined results suggest the hypothesis that TAP may function as a coactivator that bridges Tat to the general transcription machinery of the cell via TFIIB."
7707528,In vitro interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat transactivator and the general transcription factor TFIIB with the cellular protein TAP.,"We have reported the molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of a human cellular protein, TAP, which possesses a strong transcriptional activation domain and binds the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat transactivator in vitro and in vivo (L. Yu, Z. Zhang, P.M. Loewenstein, K. Desai, Q. Tang, D. Mao, J.S. Symington, and M. Green, J. Virol. 69:3007-3016, 1995). Here we show that TAP binds the general transcription factor TFIIB. Furthermore, we delineate the binding domains of TAP, Tat, and TFIIB, as well as measure the strengths and specificity of these protein-protein interactions. TAP binds strongly to Tat, with a Kd of (approximately 2 to 5) x 10(-7) M. The Tat activation region contains a 17-amino-acid conserved core domain which is the single contact site for TAP. Single-amino-acid substitutions within the Tat core domain inactivate transactivation in vivo and in vitro and greatly reduce binding of Tat to TAP in vitro. TAP binds strongly to TFIIB, with about the same Kd as for Tat. The interaction between TAP and TFIIB requires a sequence near the carboxy terminus of TFIIB which is also required for binding the strong acidic activator VP16. The contact sites for Tat and TFIIB map within the TAP C-terminal region, which contains the TAP activation domain. These combined results are consistent with the hypothesis that TAP is a cellular coactivator that bridges the Tat transactivator to the general transcription machinery via TFIIB."
9482853,"A cofactor, TIP30, specifically enhances HIV-1 Tat-activated transcription.","Replication of HIV-1 requires the viral Tat protein, which increases the extent of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II after activation at the single viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. This effect of Tat on transcription requires Tat interactions with a 5' region (TAR) in nascent transcripts as well as Tat-specific cofactors. The present study identifies a cellular protein, TIP30, that interacts with Tat and with an SRB-containing RNA polymerase II complex both in vivo and in vitro. Coexpression of TIP30 specifically enhances transactivation by Tat in transfected cells, and immunodepletion of TIP30 from nuclear extracts abolishes Tat-activated transcription without affecting Tat-independent transcription. These results implicate TIP30 as a specific coactivator that may enhance formation of a Tat-RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex."
9499409,Identification of multiple cyclin subunits of human P-TEFb.,"The transition from abortive into productive elongation is proposed to be controlled by a positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) through phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. Drosophila P-TEFb was identified recently as a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK9) paired with a cyclin subunit (cyclin T). We demonstrate here the cloning of multiple cyclin subunits of human P-TEFb (T1 and T2). Cyclin T2 has two forms (T2a and T2b) because of alternative splicing. Both cyclin T1 and T2 are ubiquitously expressed. Immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments carried out on HeLa nuclear extract (HNE) indicated that cyclin T1 and T2 were associated with CDK9 in a mutually exclusive manner and that almost all CDK9 was associated with either cyclin T1 or T2. Recombinant CDK9/cyclin T1, CDK9/cyclin T2a, and CDK9/cyclin T2b produced in Sf9 cells possessed DRB-sensitive kinase activity and functioned in transcription elongation in vitro. Either cyclin T1 or T2 was required to activate CDK9, and the truncation of the carboxyl terminus of the cyclin reduced, but did not eliminate, P-TEFb activity. Cotransfection experiments indicated that all three CDK9/cyclin combinations dramatically activated the CMV promoter."
10082552,Tat activates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcriptional elongation independent of TFIIH kinase.,"Tat stimulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcriptional elongation by recruitment of the human transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, consisting of Cdk9 and cyclin T1, to the HIV-1 promoter via cooperative binding to the nascent HIV-1 transactivation response RNA element. The Cdk9 kinase activity has been shown to be essential for P-TEFb to hyperphosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II and mediate Tat transactivation. Recent reports have shown that Tat can also interact with the multisubunit transcription factor TFIIH complex and increase the phosphorylation of CTD by the Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) complex associated with the core TFIIH. These observations have led to the proposal that TFIIH and P-TEFb may act sequentially and in a concerted manner to promote phosphorylation of CTD and increase polymerase processivity. Here, we show that under conditions in which a specific and efficient interaction between Tat and P-TEFb is observed, only a weak interaction between Tat and TFIIH that is independent of critical amino acid residues in the Tat transactivation domain can be detected. Furthermore, immunodepletion of CAK under high-salt conditions, which allow CAK to be dissociated from core-TFIIH, has no effect on either basal HIV-1 transcription or Tat activation of polymerase elongation in vitro. Therefore, unlike the P-TEFb kinase activity that is essential for Tat activation of HIV-1 transcriptional elongation, the CAK kinase associated with TFIIH appears to be dispensable for Tat function."
10454543,Tat-SF1 protein associates with RAP30 and human SPT5 proteins.,"The potent transactivator Tat recognizes the transactivation response RNA element (TAR) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and stimulates the processivity of elongation of RNA polymerase (Pol) II complexes. The cellular proteins Tat-SF1 and human SPT5 (hSPT5) are required for Tat activation as shown by immunodepletion with specific sera and complementation with recombinant proteins. In nuclear extracts, small fractions of both hSPT5 and Pol II are associated with Tat-SF1 protein. Surprisingly, the RAP30 protein of the heterodimeric transcription TFIIF factor is associated with Tat-SF1, while the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is not coimmunoprecipitated with Tat-SF1. Overexpression of Tat-SF1 and hSPT5 specifically stimulates the transcriptional activity of Tat in vivo. These results suggest that Tat-SF1 and hSPT5 are indispensable cellular factors supporting Tat-specific transcription activation and that they may interact with RAP30 in controlling elongation."
11809800,Spt5 cooperates with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat by preventing premature RNA release at terminator sequences.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein activates transcription elongation by stimulating the Tat-activated kinase (TAK/p-TEFb), a protein kinase composed of CDK9 and its cyclin partner, cyclin T1. CDK9 is able to hyperphosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase during elongation. In addition to TAK, the transcription elongation factor Spt5 is required for the efficient activation of transcriptional elongation by Tat. To study the role of Spt5 in HIV transcription in more detail, we have developed a three-stage Tat-dependent transcription assay that permits the isolation of active preinitiation complexes, early-stage elongation complexes, and Tat-activated elongation complexes. Spt5 is recruited in the transcription complex shortly after initiation. After recruitment of Tat during elongation through the transactivation response element RNA, CDK9 is activated and induces hyperphosphorylation of Spt5 in parallel to the hyperphosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II. However, immunodepletion experiments demonstrate that Spt5 is not required for Tat-dependent activation of the kinase. Chase experiments using the Spt5-depleted extracts demonstrate that Spt5 is not required for early elongation. However, Spt5 plays an important role in late elongation by preventing the premature dissociation of RNA from the transcription complex at terminator sequences and reducing the amount of polymerase pausing at arrest sites, including bent DNA sequences. This novel biochemical function of Spt5 is analogous to the function of NusG, an elongation factor found in Escherichia coli that enhances RNA polymerase stability on templates and shows sequence similarity to Spt5."
11884542,Mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus-induced complement expression in astrocytes and neurons.,"The cerebral complement system is hypothesized to contribute to neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of AIDS-associated neurological disorders. Our former results have shown that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strongly induces the synthesis of complement factor C3 in astrocytes. This upregulation explains in vivo data showing elevated complement levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AIDS-associated neurological symptoms. Since inhibition of complement synthesis and activation in the brain may represent a putative therapeutic goal to prevent virus-induced damage, we analyzed in detail the mechanisms of HIV-induced modulation of C3 expression. HIV-1 increased the C3 levels in astrocyte culture supernatants from 30 to up to 400 ng/ml; signal transduction studies revealed that adenylate cyclase activation with upregulation of cyclic AMP is the central signaling pathway to mediate that increase. Furthermore, activity of protein kinase C is necessary for HIV induction of C3, since inhibition of protein kinase C by prolonged exposure to the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate partly abolished the HIV effect. The cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and gamma interferon were not involved in mediating the HIV-induced C3 upregulation, since neutralizing antibodies had no effect. Besides whole HIV virions, the purified viral proteins Nef and gp41 are biologically active in upregulating C3, whereas Tat, gp120, and gp160 were not able to modulate C3 synthesis. Further experiments revealed that neurons were also able to respond on incubation with HIV with increased C3 synthesis, although the precise pattern was slightly different from that in astrocytes. This strengthens the hypothesis that HIV-induced complement synthesis represents an important mechanism for the pathogenesis of AIDS in the brain."
9521771,Retroviral envelope glycoprotein processing: structural investigation of the cleavage site.,"Proteolytic activation of retroviral envelope glycoprotein precursors occurs at the carboxyl side of a consensus motif consisting of the amino acid sequence (Arg/Lys)-Xaa-(Arg/Lys)-Arg. Synthetic peptides spanning the processing sites of HIV-1/2 and SIV glycoprotein precursors were examined for their ability to be cleaved by the subtilisin-like endoproteases kexin and furin. To determine the potential role of secondary structure on proteolytic activation, we examined the secondary structure of synthetic peptides by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. The results indicate that (i) the peptides were correctly cleaved by kexin and furin and therefore could be used as specific substrates for the purification and characterization of the lymphocyte endoprotease(s) responsible for proteolytic processing of precursors; (ii) the regions surrounding the cleavage sites could be characterized by their flexibility in aqueous solutions. However, a loop has been shown to be a determinant for the specificity of the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate as determined by molecular modeling. Furthermore, we determine and propose a possible structure of the cleavage site which fits to the active site of the modeled furin."
12354117,Solution structure of the HIV gp120 C5 domain.,"In HIV the viral envelope protein is processed by a host cell protease to form gp120 and gp41. The C1 and C5 domains of gp120 are thought to directly interact with gp41 but are largely missing from the available X-ray structure. Biophysical studies of the HIV gp120 C5 domain (residues 489-511 of HIV-1 strain HXB2), which corresponds to the carboxy terminal region of gp120, have been undertaken. CD studies of the C5 domain suggest that it is unstructured in aqueous solutions but partially helical in trifluoroethanol/aqueous and hexafluoroisopropanol/aqueous buffers. The solution structure of the C5 peptide in 40% trifluoroethanol/aqueous buffer was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The resulting structure is a turn helix structural motif, consistent with the CD results. Fluorescence titration experiments suggest that HIV C5 forms a 1 : 1 complex with the HIV gp41 ectodomain in the presence of cosolvent with an apparent Kd of approximately 1.0 micro m. The absence of complex formation in the absence of cosolvent indicates that formation of the turn-helix structural motif of C5 is necessary for complex formation. Examination of the C5 structure provides insight into the interaction between gp120 and gp41 and provides a possible target site for future drug therapies designed to disrupt the gp120/gp41 complex. In addition, the C5 structure lends insight into the site of HIV envelope protein maturation by the host enzymes furin and PC7, which provides other possible targets for drug therapies."
16429138,Human immunodeficiency virus 1 Nef suppresses CD40-dependent immunoglobulin class switching in bystander B cells.,"Immunoglobulin class switching from immunoglobulin M (IgM) to IgG and IgA is central to immunity against viruses and requires the activation of B cells by T cells via CD154 (CD40 ligand) and cytokines. These molecules limit their signaling activity in immune cells by turning on negative feedback proteins, including IkappaB and SOCS. We show here that negative factor (Nef) protein, an immunosuppressive human immunodeficiency virus 1 protein expressed and released by infected cells, penetrates B cells both in vivo and in vitro. Nef suppressed immunoglobulin class-switch DNA recombination by inducing IkappaBalpha and SOCS proteins, which blocked CD154 and cytokine signaling via NF-kappaB and STAT transcription factors. Thus, human immunodeficiency virus 1 may evade protective T cell-dependent IgG and IgA responses by 'hijacking' physiological feedback inhibitors in B cells via Nef."
17054986,"Luman, a new partner of HIV-1 TMgp41, interferes with Tat-mediated transcription of the HIV-1 LTR.","In our search for new partners of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), we found that the cytoplasmic domain of the TMgp41 (TMgp41 CD) subunit of HIV-1 Env interacted with Luman, a transcription factor of the CREB/ATF family. Luman is anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and subjected to activation by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). The RIP process permits the release of the activated amino-terminal fragment of Luman into the cytoplasm, and its import into the nucleus. Here, we demonstrate that interaction between the TMgp41 CD and Luman requires a region encompassing the b-Zip and TM domains of Luman and decreases the stability of this factor. Moreover, we found that overexpression of a constitutively active form of Luman in cells transfected with HXB2R HIV-1 provirus decreased the intracellular expression of Gag and Env and led to a decrease in virion release. This negative effect of activated Luman on HIV-1 production was correlated to the inhibition of Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR, which might be related to an interaction of activated Luman with Tat. Altogether, these results show that Luman acts as a partner of two major HIV-1 proteins: the TMgp41 Env subunit and Tat. The interaction between the TMgp41 subunit of Env and Luman affects the stability of the full-length Luman protein, the precursor of the activated, nuclear form of Luman, which acts negatively on Tat-mediated HIV-1 transactivation."
15331610,The glutamine-rich region of the HIV-1 Tat protein is involved in T-cell apoptosis.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the progression to AIDS are characterized by the depletion of CD4(+) T-cells. HIV-1 infection leads to apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells and the direct killing of HIV-infected cells. This is mediated, in part, by the HIV-1 Tat protein, which is secreted by virally infected cells and taken up by uninfected cells. We chemically synthesized two 86-residue subtype D Tat proteins, Ug05RP and Ug11LTS, from two Ugandan patients who were clinically categorized as either rapid progressor or long-term survivor, with non-conservative mutations located essentially in the glutamine-rich region. Structural heterogeneities were revealed by CD, which translate into differing trans-activational and apoptotic effects. CD data analysis and molecular modeling indicated that the short alpha-helix observed in subtype D Tat proteins from rapid progressor patients such as Tat Mal and Tat Ug05RP is not present in Ug11LTS. We show that Tat Ug05RP is more efficient than Tat Ug11LTS in its trans-activational role and in inducing apoptosis in binding tubulin via the mitochondrial pathway. The glutamine-rich region of Tat appears to be involved in the Tat-mediated apoptosis of T-cells."
12811817,The Sp1 transcription factor does not directly interact with the HIV-1 Tat protein.,"The role of Sp1 in regulating the trans-activating activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein has not yet been clearly defined. In fact, studies on the physical and functional interaction between Sp1 and Tat have yielded contradictory results. Here we investigated whether a physical interaction between Sp1 and Tat indeed occurs, exploiting both biochemical and genetic techniques that allow detection of direct protein-protein interactions. Studies performed with the yeast two-hybrid system indicate that Sp1 does not directly interact with the HIV-1 Tat protein. Control experiments demonstrated that both proteins are functionally expressed in the yeast cells. In vitro binding assays further confirmed that Sp1 does not physically bind Tat. These data suggest that in vivo Tat and Sp1 most likely take part of a multicomponent complex and thus encourage the search of the molecule(s) which mediate Tat-Sp1 interaction."
12832472,MAQ1 and 7SK RNA interact with CDK9/cyclin T complexes in a transcription-dependent manner.,"Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) comprises a cyclin (T1 or T2) and a kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), which phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. P-TEFb is essential for transcriptional elongation in human cells. A highly specific interaction among cyclin T1, the viral protein Tat, and the transactivation response (TAR) element RNA determines the productive transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus genome. In growing HeLa cells, half of P-TEFb is kinase inactive and binds to the 7SK small nuclear RNA. We now report on a novel protein termed MAQ1 (for ménage à quatre) that is also present in this complex. Since 7SK RNA is required for MAQ1 to associate with P-TEFb, a structural role for 7SK RNA is proposed. Inhibition of transcription results in the release of both MAQ1 and 7SK RNA from P-TEFb. Thus, MAQ1 cooperates with 7SK RNA to form a novel type of CDK inhibitor. According to yeast two-hybrid analysis and immunoprecipitations from extracts of transfected cells, MAQ1 binds directly to the N-terminal cyclin homology region of cyclins T1 and T2. Since Tat also binds to this cyclin T1 N-terminal domain and since the association between 7SK RNA/MAQ1 and P-TEFb competes with the binding of Tat to cyclin T1, we speculate that the TAR RNA/Tat lentivirus system has evolved to subvert the cellular 7SK RNA/MAQ1 system."
12944466,"The human I-mfa domain-containing protein, HIC, interacts with cyclin T1 and modulates P-TEFb-dependent transcription.","Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) hyperphosphorylates the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, permitting productive transcriptional elongation. The cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb engages cellular transcription factors as well as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transactivator Tat. To identify potential P-TEFb regulators, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen with cyclin T1 as bait. Among the proteins isolated was the human I-mfa domain-containing protein (HIC). HIC has been reported to modulate expression from both cellular and viral promoters via its C-terminal cysteine-rich domain, which is similar to the inhibitor of MyoD family a (I-mfa) protein. We show that HIC binds cyclin T1 in yeast and mammalian cells and that it interacts with intact P-TEFb in mammalian cell extracts. The interaction involves the I-mfa domain of HIC and the regulatory histidine-rich region of cyclin T1. HIC also binds Tat via its I-mfa domain, although the sequence requirements are different. HIC colocalizes with cyclin T1 in nuclear speckle regions and with Tat in the nucleolus. Expression of the HIC cDNA modulates Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) in a cell type-specific fashion. It is mildly inhibitory in CEM cells but stimulates gene expression in HeLa, COS, and NIH 3T3 cells. The isolated I-mfa domain acts as a dominant negative inhibitor. Activation of the HIV-1 LTR by HIC in NIH 3T3 cells occurs at the RNA level and is mediated by direct interactions with P-TEFb."
14609630,The Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) interacts with the EGF-like repeats of the Notch proteins and the EGF precursor.,"Employing the yeast two-hybrid system, the Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was shown to interact with a region spanning the EGF-like repeats 1-6 of the mouse Notch1, the human Notch2 and the Drosophila Notch. This observation was confirmed in mammalian cells by demonstrating an interaction between the HIV Tat and the EGF-like repeats 1-6 of the various Notch proteins. The HIV Tat protein interacted also with the full-length mouse Notch1 receptor when co-expressed in mammalian cells. Moreover, the HIV Tat protein interacted also with the EGF-like repeats 1-4-spanning domain of the human EGF precursor. The ability of the HIV Tat protein to interact with the Notch proteins and possibly with other EGF-like repeats-bearing proteins, suggests that such interactions might modulate their physiological functions, thus affecting various AIDS-associated pathologies."
15107825,BRCA1 cooperates with NUFIP and P-TEFb to activate transcription by RNA polymerase II.,"The tumor suppressor gene product BRCA1 is a component of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) holoenzyme that is involved, through binding to various regulatory proteins, in either activation or repression of transcription. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified a human zinc-finger-containing protein NUFIP that interacts with BRCA1. The ubiquitous, stably expressed, nuclear protein NUFIP specifically stimulates activator-independent pol II transcription in vitro and in vivo. Immunodepletion of the endogenous NUFIP causes a marked decrease of pol II transcription, which is then shown to be restored by stable complex of ectopically produced NUFIP and associated factors. NUFIP not only interacts with BRCA1 but also associates with the positive elongation factor P-TEFb through interaction with the regulatory Cyclin T1 subunit. Cyclin T1 is required for BRCA1- and NUFIP-dependent synergistic activation of pol II transcription in 293 cells. Mutation of the zinc-finger domain abolishes the NUFIP-mediated transcriptional activation. We show that NUFIP is associated with preinitiation complexes, open transcription complexes, and elongation complexes. In addition, NUFIP facilitates ATP-dependent dissociation of hyperphosphorylated pol II from open transcription complexes in vitro."
15940264,"The breast cell growth inhibitor, estrogen down regulated gene 1, modulates a novel functional interaction between estrogen receptor alpha and transcriptional elongation factor cyclin T1.","Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) regulates transcription of specific genes and is believed to play a major role in breast tumorigenesis. We previously identified estrogen down regulated gene 1 (EDG1 (also known as HEXIM1)) using the C-terminus of ERalpha (E/F domain) as bait in yeast two-hybrid screenings. Here we report on the role of EDG1 as a coregulator of ERalpha transcriptional activity. We observe an interaction between EDG1 and ERalpha. EDG1 inhibits the transcriptional activity of ERalpha and this is dependent upon the C-terminus of EDG1. The C-terminus of EDG1/HEXIM1 was recently shown to inhibit the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) by interacting with the cyclin T1 subunit. Here we show that ERalpha interacts with cyclin T1, cyclin T1 and ER co-occupancy on the promoter region of an ER target gene, and that this interaction plays an important role in ERalpha-induced gene expression. The interaction of ERalpha with cyclin T1 also allows ERalpha to compete with EDG1 for cyclin T1, and may release cyclin T1 from EDG1 repression. Conversely, increased EDG1 expression results in inhibition of cyclin T1 recruitment and ERalpha DNA binding. Our results support a novel functional interaction between ERalpha and cyclin T1 that is modulated by EDG1."
9153233,Binding of HIV-1 Nef to a novel thioesterase enzyme correlates with Nef-mediated CD4 down-regulation.,"Nef is a 27-kDa myristoylated protein conserved in primate lentiviruses. In vivo, simian immunodeficiency virus Nef is required in macaques to produce a high viral load and full pathological effects. Nef has at least three major effects in vitro, induction of CD4 down-regulation, alteration of T cell activation pathways, and enhancement of viral infectivity. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify cellular proteins that interact with HIV-1Lai Nef and could mediate Nef function. A human cDNA was isolated that encodes a new type of thioesterase, an enzyme that cleaves thioester bonds. This novel thioesterase is unlike the animal types I and II thioesterases previously cloned but is homologous to the Escherichia coli thioesterase II. Nef and this thioesterase interact in vitro and are co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Nef antibodies in CEM cells expressing Nef. Nef alleles from human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) isolates unable to down-regulate CD4 do not react or react poorly with thioesterase. An HIV-1 NefLai mutant selected for its lack of interaction with thioesterase was also unable to down-regulate CD4 cell-surface expression. These observations suggest that this human thioesterase is a cellular mediator of Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation."
9299485,A novel acyl-CoA thioesterase enhances its enzymatic activity by direct binding with HIV Nef.,"In addition to playing a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AIDS, HIV nef induces down-regulation of CD4 expression and TCR signaling and also regulates the sorting pathway in host T cells. To elucidate the Nef function in HIV progression, we searched for a cellular component which interacts with Nef. A human cDNA encoding a novel acyl-CoA thioesterase (hACTE-III) was isolated as an HIV nef-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid system. hACTE-III is homologous to E. coli thioesterase II but to none of the mammalian thioesterases and therefore belongs to a new type. hACTE-III exhibits enzymatic specificity for a broad range of fatty acyl-CoAs. The hACTE-III-binding region within Nef is localized in the central region (amino acids 109-152). hACTE-III greatly enhances its enzymatic activity upon direct binding to Nef. Considering that either Nef-overexpression or impaired fatty acid regulation induces alteration of subcellular morphology, the augmented hACTE-III function by Nef-binding might induce dysfunction of T cells."
10807905,The human thioesterase II protein binds to a site on HIV-1 Nef critical for CD4 down-regulation.,"A HIV-1 Nef affinity column was used to purify a 35-kDa Nef-interacting protein from T-cell lysates. The 35-kDa protein was identified by peptide microsequence analysis as the human thioesterase II (hTE) enzyme, an enzyme previously identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a potential Nef-interacting protein. Immunofluorescence studies showed that hTE localizes to peroxisomes and that coexpression of Nef and hTE leads to relocalization of Nef to peroxisomes. Interaction of Nef and hTE was abolished by point mutations in Nef at residues Asp(108), Leu(112), Phe(121), Pro(122), and Asp(123). All of these mutations also abrogated the ability of Nef to down-regulate CD4 from the surface of HIV-infected cells. Based on the x-ray and NMR structures of Nef, these residues define a surface on Nef critical for CD4 down-regulation. A subset of these mutations also affected the ability of Nef to down-regulate major histocompatibility complex class I. These results, taken together with previous studies, identify a region on Nef critical for most of its known functions. However, not all Nef alleles bind to hTE with high affinity, so the role of hTE during HIV infection remains uncertain."
9344905,HsN3 proteasomal subunit as a target for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein.,"HIV-1 Nef protein is important for pathogenicity, but its biochemical function remains obscure. To clarify its role, a yeast two-hybrid system (ths) screening was utilized to identify Nef cellular partners. Of 79 yeast clones harboring cDNAs for putative Nef binding proteins, 27 (34%) contained the coding region for HsN3 proteasomal subunit. HsN3 behaved as bona fide Nef partner in ths control crosses. Nef-HsN3 interaction was confirmed by in vitro binding experiments. In particular, recombinant Nef was able to capture the HsN3 subunit from a natural proteasome preparation. In Nef, the interacting region was mapped within aa 34-143, which span the structured portion of the protein, including the SH3-binding domain. In HsN3, Nef-binding portion was restricted to aa 73-249, and the tract 219-249-reminiscent of SH3 domain N-terminal 3/5ths-was shown to be essential, though not sufficient. Attempts to purify a Nef-HsN3 complex from transfected COS7 cells were unsuccessful. However, Nef was found to markedly downregulate intracellular levels of both a coexpressed HsN3 and the endogenous simian homologue. These results suggest that Nef, by binding to a subunit, might alter proteasome function in infected cells."
11312657,Rack1 binds HIV-1 Nef and can act as a Nef-protein kinase C adaptor.,"Nef proteins of primate immunodeficiency viruses exert pleiotropic effects, such as enhanced endocytosis of CD4 and MHC-I cell surface molecules, perturbation of signal transduction cascades, and virion infectivity enhancement. Nef function intersects that of a number of cell kinases, including C kinases (PKCs) and Src-family kinases. Here the interaction of HIV-1 Nef with Rack1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1) is reported. Nef binds the Rack1 C-terminal moiety in a yeast two-hybrid system and in cell-free pull-down assays and copurifies with in vitro translated Rack1. Nef and Rack1 partially colocalize on the trans-Golgi network and plasma membranes. The presence of Rack1 doubles Nef phosphorylation by PKCs in vitro. Our data agree with the idea that Rack1 acts as a Nef intracellular docking site, bringing Nef and PKCs together. Other signal transduction or endocytosis proteins, in particular Src-like kinases, might meet Nef by intermediation of the Rack1 adaptor."
9923610,"Identification and cloning of a novel cellular protein Naf1, Nef-associated factor 1, that increases cell surface CD4 expression.","The nef gene of human and simian immunodeficiency virus is a key factor in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pathogenesis and virus replication. Several Nef-induced phenomena, including the down-regulation of CD4 molecule, have been previously reported. In this study, we have identified and cloned a novel cellular protein Naf1 (Nef-associated factor 1), which associated with Nef in the yeast two-hybrid system and pull-down assay. The Naf1 gene generates two isoforms (Naf1alpha and beta) containing four coiled-coil structures. The Naf1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues with strong expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen. Naf1 overexpression increased cell surface CD4 expression. Nef suppressed this Naf1-induced augmentation of CD4 expression, providing a novel mode of Nef action in CD4 down-regulation."
10814565,"Interactions of HIV-1 nef with the mu subunits of adaptor protein complexes 1, 2, and 3: role of the dileucine-based sorting motif.","HIV-1 Nef interacts with cellular adaptor protein (AP) complexes and their medium (mu) subunits. However, the role of the dileucine-based sorting motif within Nef in these interactions has been incompletely characterized. Here, yeast two-hybrid assays indicated that HIV-1 Nef interacted not only with the mu subunits of AP-1 and AP-2, but also with that of AP-3. The interactions with mu1 and mu3 were markedly stronger than the interaction with mu2. Leucine residues of the sorting motif were required for the interactions with mu3 and mu2 and contributed to the interaction with mu1. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that Nef, AP-1, and AP-3 (but not AP-2) were concentrated in a juxtanuclear region near the cell center, potentially facilitating interaction between Nef and the mu1 and mu3 subunits. However, leucine residues of the sorting motif were not required for this subcellular localization of Nef. These data suggest that the dileucine motif, required for optimal viral replication, functions through interactions with a variety of AP complexes, including AP-3, potentially by recruiting adaptor complexes to subcellular locations specified by additional determinants in the Nef protein."
15698475,HIV-1 Tat interacts with LIS1 protein.,"HIV-1 Tat activates transcription of HIV-1 viral genes by inducing phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Tat can also disturb cellular metabolism by inhibiting proliferation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes and by inducing cellular apoptosis. Tat-induced apoptosis of T-cells is attributed, in part, to the distortion of microtubules polymerization. LIS1 is a microtubule-associated protein that facilitates microtubule polymerization."
12368361,Evidence for regulation of long terminal repeat transcription by Wnt transcription factor TCF-4 in human astrocytic cells.,"The Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in neural cell development and function. The key components of this pathway, beta-catenin and its partner TCF-4/LEF-1, exert their effects on transcription by entering the nuclei, where they associate with the TCF-4/LEF-1 DNA motif positioned in the promoters of several important genes. Here we examined the role of TCF-4 upon transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) promoter in human astrocytic cells. Our results showed that expression of TCF-4 in human astrocytic cells (U-87MG cells) decreased the basal and Tat-mediated transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Results from promoter deletion studies revealed that the promoter sequence of the LTR with no classical binding motif for TCF-4/LEF-1, which spans positions -80 to +80 of the LTR, remained responsive to down-regulation by TCF-4. Noticeably, removal of the sequences between positions -80 and -68 decreased the negative effect of TCF-4 on viral gene transcription. A mutant variant of TCF-4 with no binding site for beta-catenin was able to down-regulate LTR transcription, suggesting that beta-catenin may not be directly involved in the observed regulatory events. Results from the glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay as well as the combined immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of protein extract from U-87MG cells revealed an interaction of Tat with TCF-4. Subcellular examination of TCF-4 and Tat in cells expressing either protein alone showed a predominantly nuclear accumulation of these proteins. However, in cells which coexpressed both TCF-4 and Tat, significant levels of these proteins were found in the cytoplasm. All together, these observations provide evidence for the cooperative interaction of TCF-4, the important transcription factor of the Wnt pathway, with Tat; this interaction may determine the level of viral gene transcription in human astrocytic cells."
14657027,Regulation of HIV-1 gene expression by histone acetylation and factor recruitment at the LTR promoter.,"In HIV-1 infected cells, the LTR promoter, once organized into chromatin, is transcriptionally inactive in the absence of stimulation. To examine the chromosomal events involved in transcriptional activation, we analyzed histone acetylation and factor recruitment at contiguous LTR regions by a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In chronically infected cells treated with a phorbol ester, we found that acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 occurs at discrete nucleosomal regions before the onset of viral mRNA transcription. Concomitantly, we observed the recruitment of known cellular acetyl-transferases to the promoter, including CBP, P/CAF and GCN5, as well as that of the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B. The specific contribution of the viral Tat transactivator was assayed in cells harboring the sole LTR. We again observed nucleosomal acetylation and the recruitment of specific co-factors to the viral LTR upon activation by either recombinant Tat or a phorbol ester. Strikingly, P/CAF was found associated with the promoter only in response to Tat. Taken together, these results contribute to the elucidation of the molecular events underlying HIV-1 transcriptional activation."
16109376,The bromodomain protein Brd4 is a positive regulatory component of P-TEFb and stimulates RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription.,"Brd4 is a mammalian bromodomain protein that binds to acetylated chromatin. Proteomic analysis revealed that Brd4 interacts with cyclinT1 and Cdk9 that constitutes core positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). Brd4 interacted with P-TEFb in the living nucleus through its bromodomain. About half of P-TEFb was bound to the inhibitory subunit and functionally inactive. Brd4 interacted with P-TEFb that was free of the inhibitory subunit. An increase in Brd4 expression led to increased P-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) CTD and stimulation of transcription from promoters in vivo. Conversely, a reduction in Brd4 expression by siRNA reduced CTD phosphorylation and transcription, revealing that Brd4 is a positive regulatory component of P-TEFb. In chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, the recruitment of P-TEFb to a promoter was dependent on Brd4 and was enhanced by an increase in chromatin acetylation. Together, P-TEFb alternately interacts with Brd4 and the inhibitory subunit to maintain functional equilibrium in the cell."
12621451,HIV-1 proprotein processing as a target for gene therapy.,"The central role of endoconvertases and HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) in the processing of HIV proproteins makes the design of specific inhibitors important in anti-HIV gene therapy. Accordingly, we tested native alpha(1) antitrypsin (alpha(1)AT) delivered by a recombinant simian virus-40-based vector, SV(AT), as an inhibitor of HIV-1 proprotein maturation. Cell lines and primary human lymphocytes were transduced with SV(AT) without selection and detectable toxicity. Expression of alpha(1)AT was confirmed by Northern blotting, immunoprecipitation and immunostaining. SV(AT)-transduced cells showed no evidence of HIV-1-related cytopathic effects when challenged with high doses of HIV-1(NL4-3). As measured by HIV-1 p24 assay, SV(AT)-transduced cells were protected from HIV-1(NL4-3) at challenge dose of 40 000 TCID(50) (MOI = 0.04). In addition, peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with SV(AT) were protected from HIV doses challenge up to 40 000 TCID(50) (MOI = 0.04). By Western blot analyses, the delivered alpha(1)AT inhibited cellular processing of gp160 to gp120 and decreased HIV-1 virion gp120. SV(AT) inhibited processing of p55(Gag) as well. Furthermore, high levels of uncleaved p55(Gag) protein were detected in HIV virus particles recovered from SV(AT)-transduced cells lines and primary lymphocytes. Thus, delivering alpha(1)AT using SV(AT) to human lymphocytes strongly inhibits replication of HIV-1, most likely by inhibiting the activities both of the cellular serine proteases involved in processing gp160 and of the aspartyl protease, HIV-1 PR, which cleaves p55(Gag). alpha(1)AT delivered by SV(AT) may represent a novel and effective strategy for gene therapy to interfere with HIV replication, by blocking a stage in the virus replicative cycle that has until now been inaccessible to gene therapeutic intervention."
10225274,Processing and routage of HIV glycoproteins by furin to the cell surface.,"Proteolytic activation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 envelope glycoprotein precursors (gp160 and gp140, respectively) occurs at the carboxyl side of a consensus motif consisting of the highly basic amino acid sequence. We have shown previously (Hallenberger et al., 1997) and confirmed in this report, that furin and PC7 can be considered as the putative physiological enzymes involved in the proteolytic activation of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 envelope precursors. In this study, we show by cell surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation of the cell surface associated viral glycoproteins with antibodies that the mature viral envelope glycoproteins are correctly transported to the cell. membrane. Furthermore, we show that the uncleaved forms of the glycoproteins (gp160HIV-1 and gp140HIV-2) are also highly represented at the cell surface. First, transient expression of gp160 and gp140 into CV1, a cell line known to be inefficient in the proteolytic processing of the env gene, results in the expression of gp160 and gp140 at the cell surface. Moreover, HIV-1 infection of T cells also showed that gp160 is directed to the cell surface. In addition, we show that the precursor is not incorporated in the virus particle following the budding from the cell surface. Furthermore, a gp160 mutant (deficient for three carbohydrate sites on the gp41), shown to be poorly processed with the coexpressed endoproteases, is found to be transported as an uncleaved precursor to the cell surface. In contrast to HIV envelope glycoproteins, the influenza hemagglutinin precursor (HA0), that is thought to be matured by the furin-like enzymes as well, is found to be retained within the cell and is not able to reach the cell surface. Taken together, these results show that the proteolytic maturation of the viral envelope precursors of human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and type 2 is not a prerequisite for cell surface targeting of the HIV glycoproteins. Implications of these results for antiviral immune response are discussed."
16690926,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat prevents dephosphorylation of Sp1 by TCF-4 in astrocytes.,"Previous examination of the effect of TCF-4 on transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) promoter in human astrocytic cells found that TCF-4 affects the HIV-1 promoter through the GC-rich domain (nt -80 to nt -68). Here, the physical interaction and a functional consequence of TCF4-Sp1 contact were characterized. It was shown that expression of TCF-4 in U-87 MG (human astrocytic) cells decreased basal and Sp1-mediated transcription of the HIV-1 promoter. Results from a GST pull-down assay, as well as combined immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of protein extracts from U-87 MG cells, revealed an interaction of Sp1 with TCF-4. Using in vitro protein chromatography, the region of Sp1 that contacts TCF-4 was mapped to aa 266-350. It was also found that, in cell-free extracts, TCF-4 prevented dsDNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)-mediated Sp1 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, TCF-4 failed to decrease Sp1-mediated transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and Sp1 phosphorylation in cells expressing HIV-1 Tat. Results from immunoprecipitation/Western blotting demonstrated that TCF-4 lost its ability to interact with Sp1, but not with Tat, in Tat-transfected cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that activity at the HIV-1 promoter is influenced by phosphorylation of Sp1, which is affected by Tat and DNA-PK. Interactions among TCF-4, Sp1 and/or Tat may determine the level of viral gene transcription in human astrocytic cells."
15929986,Induction of OGG1 gene expression by HIV-1 Tat.,"To identify the cellular gene target for Tat, we performed gene expression profile analysis and found that Tat up-regulates the expression of the OGG1 (8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase-1) gene, which encodes an enzyme responsible for repairing the oxidatively damaged guanosine, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG). We observed that Tat induced OGG1 gene expression by enhancing its promoter activity without changing its mRNA stability. We found that the upstream AP-4 site within the OGG1 promoter is responsible and that Tat interacted with AP-4 and removed AP-4 from the OGG1 promoter by in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Thus, Tat appears to activate OGG1 expression by sequestrating AP-4. Interestingly, although Tat induces oxidative stress known to generate 8-oxo-dG, which causes the G:C to T:A transversion, we observed that the amount of 8-oxo-dG was reduced by Tat. When OGG1 was knocked down by small interfering RNA, Tat increased the amount of 8-oxo-dG, thus confirming the role of OGG1 in preventing the formation of 8-oxo-dG. These findings collectively indicate the possibility that Tat may play a role in maintenance of the genetic integrity of the proviral and host cellular genomes by up-regulating OGG1 as a feed-forward mechanism."
12727882,Recruitment of human cyclin T1 to nuclear bodies through direct interaction with the PML protein.,"Human cyclin T1, the cyclin partner of Cdk9 kinase in the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), is an essential cellular cofactor that is recruited by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat transactivator to promote transcriptional elongation from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Here we exploit fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to demonstrate that cyclin T1 physically interacts in vivo with the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein within specific subnuclear compartments that are coincident with PML nuclear bodies. Deletion mutants at the C-terminal region of cyclin T1 are negative for FRET with PML and fail to localize to nuclear bodies. Cyclin T1 and PML are also found associated outside of nuclear bodies, and both proteins are present at the chromatinized HIV-1 LTR promoter upon Tat transactivation. Taken together these results suggest that PML proteins regulate Tat- mediated transcriptional activation by modulating the availability of cyclin T1 and other essential cofactors to the transcription machinery."
10753665,Interaction between HIV-1 NEF and G(o) proteins in transfected COS-7 cells.,"Nef protein of HIV/SIV lentiviruses affects G-protein-mediated signaling, and physically associates to Lck, a myristoylated and palmitoylated Src-like tyrosine kinase. To assess whether Nef interacts with alpha-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Galpha), carrying the same lipidation motif as Lck, we transiently expressed Nef and G(o)alpha (wild-type or nonpalmitoylated C3S mutant), individually or in combination, in transfected COS-7 cells. Recombinant Nef was mostly recovered in particulate fractions, and a Nef-Green Fluorescent Protein chimera was localized at the plasmalemma by in vivo fluorescence imaging. Moreover, Nef and C3S were entirely solubilized by cold Triton X-100, and excluded from low buoyant density sucrose gradient fractions, containing caveolin-1, whereas wild-type G(o)alpha was partially resistant to Triton extraction, and colocalized with caveolin-1. After coexpression, Nef recruited soluble C3S to membranes, and the two proteins were coimmunoprecipitated by G(o)alpha and Nef antisera. We conclude that Nef interacts with nonpalmitoylated G(o)alpha, presumably outside caveolin-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane."
16475823,Biochemical indication for myristoylation-dependent conformational changes in HIV-1 Nef.,"The accessory HIV-1 Nef protein is essential for viral replication, high virus load, and progression to AIDS. These functions are mediated by the alteration of signaling and trafficking pathways and require the membrane association of Nef by its N-terminal myristoylation. However, a large portion of Nef is also found in the cytosol, in line with the observation that myristoylation is only a weak lipidation anchor for membrane attachment. We performed biochemical studies to analyze the implications of myristoylation on the conformation of Nef in aqueous solution. To establish an in vivo myristoylation assay, we first optimized the codon usage of Nef for Escherichia coli expression, which resulted in a 15-fold higher protein yield. Myristoylation was achieved by coexpression with the N-myristoyltransferase and confirmed by mass spectrometry. The myristoylated protein was soluble, and proton NMR spectra confirmed proper folding. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that myristoylated Nef appeared of smaller size than the unmodified form but not as small as an N-terminally truncated from of Nef that omits the anchor domain. Western blot stainings and limited proteolysis of both forms showed different recognition profiles and degradation pattern. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that myristoylated Nef prevails in a monomeric state while the unmodified form exists in an oligomeric equilibrium of monomer, dimer, and trimer associations. Finally, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy using multiphoton excitation revealed a shorter diffusion time for the lipidated protein compared to the unmodified form. Taken together, our data indicated myristoylation-dependent conformational changes in Nef, suggesting a rather compact and monomeric form for the lipidated protein in solution."
16237680,Estrogen attenuates gp120- and tat1-72-induced oxidative stress and prevents loss of dopamine transporter function.,"Postmenopausal women who are infected with HIV are at risk for experiencing dementia and Parkinson's-like symptoms associated with low levels of estrogen. Neurotoxic damage leading to these symptoms may involve HIV-associated proteins gp120 and/or tat(1-72) (tat). Our hypothesis is that 17beta-Estradiol (E(2)) is an effective agent for protection against gp120/tat-induced damage associated with increased oxidative stress, with particular focus on peroxynitrite-induced oxidative stress. We used SK-N-SH cells and striatal synaptosomes from Sprague-Dawley rats as model systems to assess neuroprotection by E(2). Cells coincubated with SIN-1(3-morpholinosydnonimine) or tat and gp120, together or separately, significantly increased oxidative stress on the SK-N-SH cells, as indicated by the increase in the levels of dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) fluorescence. These data suggest that a component of tat and gp120 neurotoxicity may be due to increased oxidative stress. Coincubation with E(2) attenuated tat- and gp120-induced increase in fluorescence. Coincubation with progesterone had no effect on tat-induced fluorescence, whereas coincubation with the E(2) antagonist ICI 182,780 and E(2) completely prevented the effects observed with E(2) alone. Both gp120 and tat decreased [(3)H] dopamine uptake into striatal synaptosomes by decreasing the V(max) of the dopamine transporter (DAT). Pretreatment of synaptosomes with E(2) (100 nM) partially reversed this reduction. In conclusion, E(2) appears to be effective for preventing the oxidative stress and loss of DAT function associated with gp120/tat neurotoxicity."
15603708,Activation of mitogen activated protein kinases via complement receptor type 2.,"Complement receptor type 2 (CR2) is the receptor for C3d and C3dg and for Epstein-Barr virus. The aim of our study was to explore whether CR2 can independently mediate the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs, including ERK, JNK, and p38MAPK), and to highlight the molecular mechanism of CD4+ cell deletion in AIDS."
11958689,Extracellular Nef protein activates signal transduction pathway from Ras to mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades that leads to activation of human immunodeficiency virus from latency.,"We previously reported that viral antigen expression was markedly up-regulated by stimulation with extracellular Nef, similar to the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and phorbol myristate acetate, in model cells for HIV-1 latency. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism of this novel Nef function. Flow cytometry revealed specific binding of Nef on the surface of latently infected cells. Furthermore, activation of Ras in the cells was detected after treatment with Nef, indicating the involvement of Ras in Nef-mediated activation of HIV-1 from latency. This was also confirmed by the observations that HIV-1 long-terminal repeat-luciferase (LTR-Luc) activity was significantly up-regulated by introduction of the active Ras into uninfected cells, and that LTR-Luc activity observed in Nef-treated cells was specifically inhibited by introduction of a dominant negative Ras. In addition, PD98059 inhibited the activation of HIV-1 by Nef, but not by TNF-alpha. Thus, Nef-mediated reactivation of HIV-1 in latent model cells occurs by signal transduction from Ras to mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades."
12885232,Structural and dynamic properties of the HIV-1 tat transduction domain in the free and heparin-bound states.,"An 11-residue basic domain of the HIV-1 tat protein, termed the tat transduction domain (TTD), has been shown to mediate transfer of biomolecules across biological membranes. The mechanism of TTD-mediated membrane translocation is currently unknown but thought to involve binding to heparan sulfate, which is found in proteoglycans that are ubiquitously present on cell surfaces. To study the mechanism of TTD-mediated membrane translocation, the TTD was fused to the C-terminus of a model cargo protein, the IgG binding domain of streptococcal protein G (PG) to form PG-TTD. NMR studies of PG-TTD in the free state indicated that the structure of the PG moiety of PG-TTD was not perturbed by the presence of the TTD and that the TTD moiety is in an extended conformation. Heteronuclear relaxation measurements of PG-TTD in the free state show that the TTD moiety of PG-TTD is relatively mobile (e.g., the average S(2) value of the TTD and PG core are approximately 0.54 and approximately 0.84, respectively). PG-TTD has been shown to bind to heparin by isothermal titration calorimetry (K(D) = 0.37 microM, Delta H = -12 kcal/mol, Delta S = -11 cal/mol/T). NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that heparin binds to the TTD moiety of PG-TTD. The heteronuclear relaxation measurements of PG-TTD in complex with heparin show that the TTD becomes less dynamic when bound to heparin (average S(2) value of the TTD is 0.69 in the presence of heparin). A model for the first step of TTD-mediated entry into cells is presented."
9778343,RT loop flexibility enhances the specificity of Src family SH3 domains for HIV-1 Nef.,"Understanding the issue of specificity imposed in the interactions of SH3 domains has largely been addressed in studies investigating the interaction of proline-rich amino acid sequences derived from potential ligands for these domains. Although the interaction with this motif forms an essential platform in the binding of SH3 domains, in many cases little specificity is observed and the difference in affinity for so-called specific and nonspecific proline-rich sequences is not great. Furthermore, the binding interface between an SH3 domain and a protein ligand appears to encompass more interactions than are represented by that involving the proline-rich motif. Here we investigate the issue of specificity from the opposite point of view; namely, how does a ligand recognize different SH3 domains? We present the crystal structure of the unbound SH3 domain from hemopoietic cell kinase (Hck) which is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. This structure reveals that, unlike the structures of other Src kinase SH3 domains, the RT loop region is highly mobile and lacks a network of hydrogen bonds that is elsewhere apparent. The RT loop has been shown to form a major part of the binding interface between SH3 domains and HIV-1 Nef. Thermodynamic data, derived from isothermal titration calorimetry, for the binding of Hck SH3 to HIV-1 Nef show that the binding of Hck (KD = 1.5 microM) is approximately an order of magnitude tighter than those of other Src family kinases that were investigated (Fyn, Lck, and Src). This increase in affinity is attributed to, among other effects, the inherent flexibility in the RT loop which does not require breaking the network of hydrogen bonds to adopt the conformation required for binding."
12549909,Molecular recognition of the human coactivator CBP by the HIV-1 transcriptional activator Tat.,"HIV-1 Tat is required for the expression of the viral genome. Tat binds to an RNA stem-loop and mediates the recruitment of human coactivators to facilitate HIV-1 transcription. The coactivator and acetyltransferase CREB binding protein (CBP), and the paralog p300, are recruited to the HIV-1 promoter by Tat. Here we identify the interacting domains of Tat and CBP. Circular dichroism and pulldown assays show that full-length Tat binds to the KIX domain of CBP, but not to the C/H1 or CR2 domains. Circular dichroism and NMR studies of Tat deletion mutants localize the KIX-binding domain of Tat to the N-terminal 24 residues of Tat. Transient cotransfections demonstrate that exogenous KIX behaves as a dominant negative to Tat-mediated transcription in human T-cells, suggesting that Tat and KIX interact in vivo. These findings indicate that Tat targets the KIX domain of CBP and provide insight into the molecular interactions involved in regulating HIV-1 gene expression."
11921231,Structural investigation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 cleavage site.,"The selective proteolytic activation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 by furin and other precursor convertases (PCs) occurs at the carboxyl side of the sequence Arg508-Glu-Lys-Arg511 (site 1), in spite of the presence of another consensus sequence: Lys500-Ala-Lys-Arg503 (site 2). We report on the solution structural analysis of a 19-residue synthetic peptide, p498, which spans the two gp160-processing sites 1 and 2, and is properly digested by furin at site 1. A molecular model is obtained for p498, by means of molecular dynamics simulations, from NMR data collected in trifluoroethanol/water. The peptide N-terminal side presents a 9-residue helical segment, enclosing the processing site 2; the C-terminal segment can be described as a loop exposing the processing site 1. A hypothesis for the docking of p498 onto the catalytic domain of human furin, modeled by homology and fitting previous site-directed mutagenesis studies, is also presented. p498 site 1 is shown to have easy access to the furin catalytic site, unlike the nonphysiological site 2. Finally, on the basis of available data, we suggest a possible structural motif required for the gp160-PCs recognition."
10339411,Structure of the anchor-domain of myristoylated and non-myristoylated HIV-1 Nef protein.,"Negative factor (Nef) is a regulatory myristoylated protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that has a two-domain structure consisting of an anchor domain and a core domain separated by a specific cleavage site of the HIV proteases. For structural analysis, the HIV-1 Nef anchor domain (residues 2-57) was synthesized with a myristoylated and non-myristoylated N terminus. The structures of the two peptides were studied by1H NMR spectroscopy and a structural model was obtained by restrained molecular dynamic simulations. The non-myristoylated peptide does not have a unique, compactly folded structure but occurs in a relatively extended conformation. The only rather well-defined canonical secondary structure element is a short two-turn alpha-helix (H2) between Arg35 and Gly41. A tendency for another helical secondary structure element (H1) can be observed for the arginine-rich region (Arg17 to Arg22). Myristoylation of the N-terminal glycine residue leads to stabilization of both helices, H1 and H2. The first helix in the arginine-rich region is stabilized by the myristoylation and now contains residues Pro14 to Arg22. The second helix appears to be better defined and to contain more residues (Ala33 to Gly41) than in the absence of myristoylation. In addition, the hydrophobic N-terminal myristic acid residue interacts closely with the side-chain of Trp5 and thereby forms a loop with Gly2, Gly3 and Lys4 in the kink region. This interaction could possibly be disturbed by phosphorylation of a nearby serine residue, and modifiy the characteristic membrane interactions of the HIV-1 Nef anchor domain."
9049297,Separable functions of Nef disrupt two aspects of T cell receptor machinery: CD4 expression and CD3 signaling.,"The Nef protein alters T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in T cells and is critical for the pathogenesis of AIDS. We used a transient expression assay in a human CD4+ T cell line to analyze the interaction of Nef with the TCR machinery. We show that, in addition to down-regulating CD4 expression on the cell surface, Nef blocks a receptor-proximal event in CD3 signaling. Analysis of a large number of mutant Nef proteins demonstrated that the effects of Nef on CD4 expression and on CD3 signaling are separable. The ability of Nef to block CD3 signaling was selectively abolished by mutations in the central part of the Nef protein and in particular by those known to disrupt the SH3 binding surface in the structured core of Nef. In contrast, the ability of Nef to down-regulate CD4 expression was selectively abolished by two clusters of mutations, one in the N-terminal and one in the C-terminal region of Nef. These two regions correspond to the two flexible loops in Nef as predicted by solution NMR analysis. We show that this general functional organization is conserved between the Nef proteins of the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and SIV). Our data demonstrate that Nef has at least two independent mechanisms to alter TCR function and thus may interfere with a range of T cell responses."
8599760,The solution structure of HIV-1 Nef reveals an unexpected fold and permits delineation of the binding surface for the SH3 domain of Hck tyrosine protein kinase.,"The solution structure of HIV-1 Nef has been solved by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The construct employed to circumvent problems associated with aggregation was a double-deletion mutant (delta2-39, delta159-173) in which conformationally disordered regions of the protein at the N terminus and in a long solvent-exposed flexible loop were removed, without affecting the properties or structural integrity of the remainder of the protein. Despite the absence of any sequence similarity, the overall fold of Nef is reminiscent of that of the family of winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding proteins. The binding surface of Nef for the SH3 domain of Hck tyrosine protein kinase has been mapped and reveals a non-contiguous (in terms of amino-acid sequence) interaction surface. This unique feature may suggest possible avenues for drug design aimed at inhibiting the interaction between Nef and SH3 domains."
17046994,HIV-1 Nef upregulates CCL2/MCP-1 expression in astrocytes in a myristoylation- and calmodulin-dependent manner.,"HIV-associated dementia (HAD) correlates with infiltration of monocytes into the brain. The accessory HIV-1 negative factor (Nef) protein, which modulates several signaling pathways, is constitutively present in persistently infected astroctyes. We demonstrated that monocytes responded with chemotaxis when subjected to cell culture supernatants of nef-expressing astrocytic U251MG cells. Using a protein array, we identified CC chemokine ligand 2/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2/MCP-1) as a potential chemotactic factor mediating this phenomenon. CCL2/MCP-1 upregulation by Nef was further confirmed by ribonuclease protection assay, RT-PCR and ELISA. By applying neutralizing antibodies against CCL2/MCP-1 and using CCR2-deficient monocytes, we confirmed CCL2/MCP-1 as the exclusive factor secreted by nef-expressing astrocytes capable of attracting monocytes. Additionally, we showed that Nef-induced CCL2/MCP-1 expression depends on the myristoylation moiety of Nef and requires functional calmodulin. In summary, we suggest that Nef-induced CCL2/MCP-1 expression in astrocytes contributes to infiltration of monocytes into the brain, and thereby to progression of HAD."
1316930,Serum angiotensin-1 converting enzyme activity processes a human immunodeficiency virus 1 gp160 peptide for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.,"T cell stimulation by the human immunodeficiency virus 1 gp160-derived peptide p18 presented by H-2Dd class I major histocompatibility complex molecules in a cell-free system was found to require proteolytic cleavage. This extracellular processing was mediated by peptidases present in fetal calf serum. In vitro processing of p18 resulted in a distinct reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography profile, from which a biologically active product was isolated and sequenced. This peptide processing can be specifically blocked by the angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril, and can occur by exposing p18 to purified ACE. The ability of naturally occurring extracellular proteases to convert inactive peptides to T cell antigens has important implications for understanding cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in vivo, and for rational peptide vaccine design."
1284814,Carbohydrate binding properties of the envelope glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"Here, we confirm and extend our previous findings on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyl binding properties. We show the occurrence of saturable, temperature, pH, and calcium dependent carbohydrate-specific interactions between recombinant precursor gp160 (rgp160) and two affinity matrices: D-mannose-divinylsulfone-agarose, and natural glycoprotein, fetuin, also coupled to agarose. Binding of rgp160 to the matrices was inhibited by soluble mannosyl derivatives, alpha-D-Man17-BSA and mannan, by beta-D-GlcNAc47-BSA and by glycopeptides from Pronase-treated porcine thyroglobulin, which produces oligomannose and complex N-linked glycans. Glycopeptides from Endoglycosidase H-treated thyroglobulin partially inhibited rgp160 binding, as did the asialo-agalacto-tetraantennary precursor oligosaccharide of human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein for binding to fetuin-agarose. beta-D-Glucan and beta-D-Gal17-BSA had no or only limited effect. Also, surface unit rgp120 specifically interacted with fetuin-agarose and soluble fetuin, but in the latter case with a twofold reduced affinity relative to rgp160. After affinity chromatography, rgp160 was specifically retained by the two matrices and eluted by mannan in both cases, while rgp120 was not retained by fetuin-agarose but only eluted as a significantly retarded peak, which confirms its specific but weak interaction. Thus, rgp160 interacts with both oligomannose type, and the mannosyl core of complex type N-linked glycans, and its gp120 region plays a role in this interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8444901,Identification of a novel cell attachment domain in the HIV-1 Tat protein and its 90-kDa cell surface binding protein.,"The HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat is essential for viral gene expression and replication. Tat is taken up by cells and transactivates the HIV-LTR promoter in the cell nucleus. The present studies show that cells adhere to both synthetic and recombinant Tat, and, using synthetic peptides, we localize the binding site to a region spanning amino acid residues 49-57 (peptide Tat49-57). Tat49-57 also inhibited cell attachment to solid phase full-length Tat peptide and to recombinant Tat protein. Using Tat peptide affinity chromatography, we identified a 90-kDa cell surface protein that binds to Tat. The 90-kDa protein could be eluted from the Tat column using the Tat49-57 peptide. A 90-kDa cell surface Tat binding protein was also identified by coprecipitation with Tat after incubation with radiolabeled cell membrane preparations. Co-precipitation of the 90-kDa protein was inhibited by competition with a Tat49-65 peptide, but not with Tat55-86. Our findings suggest that cellular attachment to Tat is mediated through a 90-kDa cell surface protein that binds to a Tat domain between amino acids 49 and 57."
1722325,An optimal viral peptide recognized by CD8+ T cells binds very tightly to the restricting class I major histocompatibility complex protein on intact cells but not to the purified class I protein.,"CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize cell surface complexes formed by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) glycoproteins and antigenic peptides. We have identified a peptide nonamer (termed IV9) derived from the human immunodeficiency virus that is over a millionfold more active (at subpicomolar concentrations) than peptide analogues longer or shorter by one or two amino acid residues. Although IV9 does not detectably bind to isolated MHC-I molecules as measured by equilibrium dialysis, we quantitated its specific binding in unaltered form to MHC-I on intact cells. Less than 1% of cell surface MHC-I forms complexes with IV9, which suffices to trigger maximal cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity. By contrast, a peptide dodecamer that includes the IV9 sequence and is active at micromolar concentrations does not bind to MHC-I on intact cells, raising the possibility that this longer peptide undergoes processing. Using stoichiometrically iodinated IV9 to obviate the ambiguities associated with trace labeling methods, we measured the dissociation kinetics of purified peptide/MHC-I complexes isolated by affinity chromatography and found these complexes to be exceedingly stable (t1/2 = 200-600 hr)."
12202226,Interaction between TGFbeta signaling proteins and C/EBP controls basal and Tat-mediated transcription of HIV-1 LTR in astrocytes.,"Signal transduction pathways induced by cytokines can modulate the level of HIV-1 gene transcription and replication in a variety of cells including those from the central nervous system. Here, we investigated the effect of TGFbeta-1 signaling the factors, including Smads, on transcription of the viral LTR in human astrocytic cells. Ectopic expression of Smad-3 increased activity of the viral promoter, while its partner protein, Smad-4, caused a slight decrease in viral gene transcription. Further, Smad-4 was able to suppress transcriptional activation of the LTR by Smad-3 as well as by C/EBPbeta, another activator of LTR transcription in these cells. Results from promoter deletion experiments identified the C/EBP-binding site, which is positioned between nucleotides -114 and -102 as one of the targets for Smad-mediated regulation of the LTR. Band-shift studies showed inhibition of C/EBP binding to its target DNA in protein extract from cells overexpressing Smad-3 and Smad-4. Results from GST pull-down assay and combined immunoprecipitation/Western blot of protein extracts from human astrocytes verified the association of Smad-3 and Smad-4 with C/EBPbeta, suggesting that interaction of C/EBPbeta with Smad-3 and Smad-4 may have a negative impact upon C/EBPbeta-mediated activation of the LTR. Interestingly, Smad-4 showed no inhibitory effect on viral gene transcription in cells expressing Tat protein. However, in the presence of Smad-3, expression of Smad-4 exerted a negative effect on Tat-mediated activation of the LTR promoter. These observations pointed to the functional interplay between viral and cellular proteins in modulating LTR transcription."
16105876,alpha(v)beta3-integrin-dependent activation of focal adhesion kinase mediates NF-kappaB activation and motogenic activity by HIV-1 Tat in endothelial cells.,"Once in the extracellular environment, the transactivator protein HIV-1 Tat exerts several pleiotropic effects by interacting with different cellular receptors, including integrin alpha(v)beta3. Real-time surface plasmon resonance analysis reveals that Tat/alpha(V)beta3 interaction occurs with rapid kinetics (association and dissociation rates equal to 1.16 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1) and 3.78 x 10(-1) s(-1), respectively) and high affinity (dissociation constant = 32 nM). Through this interaction, substratum-immobilized Tat promotes adhesion and motogenic activity in endothelial cells. Also, alpha(v)beta(3)/Tat interaction triggers the activation of focal adhesion kinase, RhoA and pp60src. Overexpression of the dominant negative form of focal adhesion kinase, but not of an inactive Leu1034Ser substitution mutant isoform, impairs the activation of focal adhesion kinase and RhoA, but not that of pp60src, without affecting endothelial cell adhesion and spreading. alpha(v)beta3/Tat interaction triggers the activation of NF-kappaB in endothelial cells in a focal adhesion kinase-, RhoA- and pp60src-dependent manner, as shown in dominant negative focal adhesion kinase transfectants or using specific pharmacological inhibitors. Finally, the activation of focal adhesion kinase, RhoA, NF-kappaB and pp60src are required to mediate the motogenic activity of Tat in endothelial cells. Since Tat accumulates in an immobilized form in the extracellular matrix, these results provide new biochemical and biological insights about alpha(v)beta3/Tat interaction exploitable for the design of anti-Tat strategies."
8673525,Influence of N-linked glycans in V4-V5 region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 glycoprotein gp160 on induction of a virus-neutralizing humoral response.,"One of the functions of N-linked glycans of viral glycoproteins is protecting otherwise accessible neutralization epitopes of the viral envelope from neutralizing antibodies. The aim of the present study was to explore the possibility to obtain a more broadly neutralizing immune response by immunizing guinea pigs with gp160 depleted of three N-linked glycans in the CD4-binding domain by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant and wild type gp160 were formulated into immunostimulating complexes and injected s.c. into guinea pigs. Both preparations induced high serum antibody response to native gp120 and V3 peptides. Both preparations also induced antibodies that bound equally well to the V3 loop or the CD4-binding region, as determined by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The sera from animals, immunized with mutated glycoprotein, did not neutralize nonrelated HIV strains better than did sera from animals, immunized with wild type glycoprotein. Instead, a pattern of preferred homologous neutralization was observed, i.e., sera from animals, immunized with mutant gp160, neutralized mutant virus better than wild type virus, and vice versa. These data indicated that elimination of the three N-linked glycans from gp160 resulted in an altered local antigenic conformation but did not uncover hidden neutralization epitopes, broadening the immune response."
8018916,Effect of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 on cytokine production from cord-blood T cells.,"We have recently demonstrated that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp160 enhances the in vitro differentiation of hematopoietic myeloid progenitor cells derived from cord blood by inducing secretion of colony-stimulating factor(s) (CSF) in T cells, presumably through the interaction of gp160 with CD4 molecules. In this study, we investigated the gp 160-induced humoral CSFs in cord blood by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by polymerase chain reaction on reverse-transcribed mRNA (RT-PCR). We demonstrate that gp160 can induce interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) protein secretion only in purified cord-blood T cells (CB-T) and not in detectable amounts in whole cord blood cells (WCB); cytokine mRNA induction occurred in purified CB-T and WCB, but was significantly greater in the former. Treatment of gp160 with soluble CD4 (sCD4) abolished the secretion of all three cytokines in CB-T cells, which suggests that interaction of gp160 with CD4 molecules is required for the secretion of these cytokines from CB-T cells. However, in WCB cells, sCD4 treatment of gp160 resulted in inhibition of only IL-3 and GM-CSF mRNA, whereas IL-6 secretion was enhanced. Purified cord-blood monocytes secreted only IL-6 in response to gp160, and the gp160-induced IL-6 secretion by monocytes was also further increased by gp160 + sCD4 complex. Furthermore, monocyte culture supernatants suppressed gp160-induced IL-3 secretion from CB-T cells. These findings indicate that (1) CB-T cells are a potent source of gp160-induced hematopoietic cytokines, and (2) that different mechanisms are involved in the induction of IL-6 by gp160 in the T- and non-T-cell fractions of cord blood. The ability of HIV gp160 to induce hematopoietic CSFs in cord blood may be important in HIV pathogenesis."
1678778,Effect of a glucosidase inhibitor on the bioactivity and immunoreactivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein.,"Apparently conflicting results have been reported regarding the role of env glycoprotein glycans in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectivity and cytopathogenicity. Whereas we have shown that enzymic removal of carbohydrates from mature envelope glycoproteins has only limited effect on the ability of HIV-1 to bind to CD4 and to infect target cells, sugar analogues that interfere with the glycosylation process of the nascent molecule markedly reduce virus infectivity. Here we have investigated the effect of a glucosidase inhibitor, 1-deoxynojirimycin (dNM), on the bioactivity and immunoreactivity of precursor gp160 produced by recombinant vaccinia virus-infected BHK-21 cells (rgp160). dNM (4 mM) did not affect the amount of rgp160 recovered nor its secretion from the cells. As described by other authors the effect of dNM was incomplete, resulting in the production of rgp160, the glycosylation of which was heterogeneous with respect to apparent Mr distribution and to sensitivity to endoglycosidase H and endoglycosidase F, all the species being susceptible to N-glycanase. A major reduction of the binding to CD4+ cells was noted with rgp 160 produced by dNM-treated cells using a quantitative indirect immunofluorescence assay and labelling with polyclonal human anti-HIV IgG. Similarly, dNM treatment altered the accessibility to murine monoclonal antibody 110-4 of the exposed V3 loop of HIV-1 gp120 by at least 10-fold, as determined by either ELISA capture assay or immunoaffinity purification. Such bioactivity and conformation modifications, which result from the abnormal folding of the nascent glycoprotein due to aberrant glycosylation, may account for the impaired HIV-1 infectivity elicited by dNM."
1875953,Interaction of the envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus with C1q and fibronectin under conditions present in human saliva.,"Human saliva has been shown to reduce the infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) particles in vitro. The factors in human saliva involved in this inhibition of HIV infectivity are unknown, although the salivary sediment of normal individuals has the major HIV neutralizing activity. Interestingly, the first complement component (C1) has been detected on the surface of the salivary sediment in the whole saliva of normal individuals. At the relatively low ionic strength of saliva, we determined that purified human C1q bound with high affinity to the envelope glycoprotein of HIV. Normally, the interaction of the C1q globular heads with immune complexes causes C1 activation. However, direct interactions between C1 and rgp120 (or rgp160) did not lead to C1 fixation, as determined by hemolytic studies with rate-limiting levels of C1, nor did rgp120 cause C1 activation as determined by activated C1s-mediated C4 conversion in normal human serum. Using ELISA, it was observed that intact C1, with the C1r2C1s2 tetramer associated with the collagen-like stem of C1q, did not bind to immobilized rgp120, whereas free C1q did bind. In addition, digestion of the C1q stem portion with collagenase completely eliminated its binding to rgp120. These findings suggest that the collagen-like stem region of C1q, rather than the globular heads, may participate in the binding to the envelope glycoprotein of HIV. Fibronectin, which is present in submandibular saliva, appeared to bind to rgp120 and to enhance the interaction of C1q with rgp120. It is conceivable that C1q and fibronectin, in binding and sequestering HIV particles (i.e. to the salivary sediment), may play an important role in the reduction of HIV transmission via saliva. Further studies will be needed to test the latter speculation."
11137132,Involvement of a herbimycin A-sensitive protein tyrosine kinase in extracellular action of HIV-1 Nef.,"Extracellular Nef which has been implicated in disease progression and development of AIDS induces IL-10, a potent immunosuppressive cytokine, in vitro. The present study was designed to examine whether the action of extracellular Nef is a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)-dependent event. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting reveals that recombinant HIV-1 Nef induces rapid tyrosyl phosphorylation of several cellular proteins in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Pre-treatment of cells with herbimycin A, but not with genistein, significantly abolishes the Nef-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Furthermore, ELISA and RNase protection assays show that herbimycin A significantly blocks Nef-induced production of IL-10 at both the protein and the mRNA level. Genistein and aminogenistein have a much less blocking effect on the ability of Nef to induce IL-10. These results provide evidence for the involvement of a herbimycin A-sensitive PTK in the signal transduction pathway for exogenous HIV-1 Nef."
14734774,"Induction of C chemokine XCL1 (lymphotactin/single C motif-1 alpha/activation-induced, T cell-derived and chemokine-related cytokine) expression by HIV-1 Tat protein.","HIV-1 Tat has been proposed as a key agent in many AIDS-related disorders, including HIV-1-associated neurological diseases. We have recently shown that Tat expression induces a significant increase in T lymphocytes in the brains of Tat transgenic mice. The CNS infiltration of T lymphocytes has been noted in AIDS patients. In the present study using this unique genetic system we attempted to understand the underlying mechanisms of Tat expression-induced infiltration of T lymphocytes by examining chemokine expression. RNase protection assay revealed that in addition to CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha)), CCL4 (MIP-1beta), CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL2 (MIP-2), and CXCL10 (inducing protein-10), XCL1 (lymphotactin/single C motif-1alpha/activation-induced, T cell-derived and chemokine-related cytokine) was identified to be up-regulated by Tat expression. XCL1 is a C chemokine and plays a specific and important role in tissue-specific recruitment of T lymphocytes. Thus, we further determined the relationship between Tat and XCL1 expression. Tat-induced XCL1 expression was further confirmed by XCL1-specific RT-PCR and ELISA. Combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining identified astrocytes, monocytes, and macrophages/microglia as XCL1-producing cells in vivo. Using human astrocytes, U87.MG cells, as an in vitro model, activation of XCL1 expression was positively correlated with Tat expression. Moreover, the XCL1 promoter-driven reporter gene assay showed that Tat-induced XCL1 expression occurred at the transcriptional level. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Tat directly trans-activated XCL1 expression and suggest potential roles of Tat-induced XCL1 expression in the CNS infiltration of T lymphocytes during HIV-1 infection and subsequent HIV-1-induced neurological diseases."
14597672,HIV-1 Nef triggers Vav-mediated signaling pathway leading to functional and morphological differentiation of dendritic cells.,"The accessory HIV-1 Nef protein plays a key role in AIDS pathogenesis. We recently demonstrated that exogenous Nef triggers phenotypic and functional differentiation of immature dendritic cells (DCs). Here we investigated whether the Nef-induced DC differentiation occurs with morphological remodeling and have focused on the interference of Nef in the signaling pathways that regulates DC maturation. We found that exogenous Nef enters immature DCs, promoting their functional and morphological differentiation. Specifically, Nef promotes interleukin (IL) -12 release, which closely fits with nuclear factor (NF) -kappaB activation. Nef induces rearrangement of actin microfilaments, leading to uropod and ruffle formation. Moreover, Nef increases the capacity of DCs to form clusters with allogeneic CD4+ T cells, improving immunological synapse formation. Searching for molecules involved in Nef-triggered signaling pathways driving the DC maturation, we found that Nef targets Vav and promotes its tyrosine phosphorylation, associated with its nucleus-to-cytoplasm redistribution. This has a direct effect on Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for the small GTPase Rac1. We hypothesize that targeting Vav, Nef modulates both early signaling events (such as cytoskeletal rearrangement) and delayed responses (such as transcriptional regulation), promoting DC differentiation. Our results highlight how Nef may enhance T lymphocyte activation, thus fostering virus dissemination, manipulating the DC arm of the immune response."
9792838,SH3-Domain binding function of HIV-1 Nef is required for association with a PAK-related kinase.,"HIV-1 Nef has previously been shown to bind to Src homology-3 (SH3) domains of a subset of Src family tyrosine kinases. In addition, Nef has been reported to coprecipitate with a serine/threonine kinase activity termed NAK (for Nef-associated kinase). The identity of NAK remains uncertain, but it has been suggested to represent a novel member of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family. We report here that NAK autophosphorylation is increased not only by an activated form of the p21-family GTPase cdc42 but also by a plasma membrane-targeted fragment of the adapter protein Nck, thus providing further evidence that NAK is related to PAKs. A detailed structure-based mutational analysis of Nef revealed that all amino acid changes that inhibited the Nef/Hck-SH3 interaction, as measured by surface-plasmon resonance, also abolished coprecipitation of NAK. As PAK family proteins do not contain SH3 domains, these observations are best explained by a protein complex in which Nef, NAK, and an SH3-protein all contact each other. In addition, a number of conserved amino acids in Nef that are not involved in SH3 binding were also found to be crucial for association with NAK. Molecular modeling suggests that these residues are involved in formation of an adjacent binding surface for NAK or another critical component of the NAK/Nef complex."
14617802,HIV Nef-mediated major histocompatibility complex class I down-modulation is independent of Arf6 activity.,"HIV Nef has a number of important biological effects, including the down-modulation of several immunological important molecules (CD4, major histocompatibility complex [MHC] class I). Down-modulation of CD4 seems to be via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, whereas down-modulation of MHC class I remains unexplained. Several mutant proteins, including mutations in the small GTPase Arf6, have been used to probe membrane traffic pathways. One such mutant has recently been used to propose that Nef acts through Arf6 to activate the endocytosis of MHC class I. Here, we show that MHC class I down-modulation is unaffected by other Arf6 mutants that provide more specific perturbations in the GDP-GTP cycling of Arf6. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase, an upstream activator of Arf6, also had no effect on the internalization step, but its activity is required to direct MHC class I to the trans-Golgi network. We conclude that the apparent Arf6 dependency of Nef-mediated MHC class I down-modulation is due to nonspecific perturbations in membrane traffic."
12692243,Recruitment of Tat to heterochromatin protein HP1 via interaction with CTIP2 inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in microglial cells.,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) plays a key role as inducer of viral gene expression. We report that Tat function can be potently inhibited in human microglial cells by the recently described nuclear receptor cofactor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor-interacting protein 2 (CTIP2). Overexpression of CTIP2 leads to repression of HIV-1 replication, as a result of inhibition of Tat-mediated transactivation. In contrast, the related CTIP1 was unable to affect Tat function and viral replication. Using confocal microscopy to visualize Tat subcellular distribution in the presence of the CTIPs, we found that overexpression of CTIP2, and not of CTIP1, leads to disruption of Tat nuclear localization and recruitment of Tat within CTIP2-induced nuclear ball-like structures. In addition, our studies demonstrate that CTIP2 colocalizes and associates with the heterochromatin-associated protein HP1alpha. The CTIP2 protein harbors two Tat and HP1 interaction interfaces, the 145-434 and the 717-813 domains. CTIP2 and HP1alpha associate with Tat to form a three-protein complex in which the 145-434 CTIP2 domain interacts with the N-terminal region of Tat, while the 717-813 domain binds to HP1. The importance of this Tat binding interface and of Tat subnuclear relocation was confirmed by analysis of CTIP2 deletion mutants. Our findings suggest that inhibition of HIV-1 expression by CTIP2 correlates with recruitment of Tat within CTIP2-induced structures and relocalization within inactive regions of the chromatin via formation of the Tat-CTIP2-HP1alpha complex. These data highlight a new mechanism of Tat inactivation through subnuclear relocalization that may ultimately lead to inhibition of viral pathogenesis."
9079699,The enhanced immune response to the HIV gp160/LAMP chimeric gene product targeted to the lysosome membrane protein trafficking pathway.,"The lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMP), found in the outer membrane of lysosomes and also in a multilaminar compartment that contains major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) proteins, are directed to their localization by a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal sequence. Our studies of the immune response to LAMP-targeted proteins has led to the application of a HIV-1 gp160/LAMP chimeric gene as a novel means to enhance the MHC II presentation of gp160. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that the gp160/LAMP protein had a cellular localization corresponding to that of lysosomes. Pulse-chase analysis confirmed that the rates of synthesis of gp160/LAMP and wild type gp160 were comparable and that both proteins were processed to gp120 at similar rates. However, the gp160/LAMP was degraded more rapidly than the wild type gp160. MHC II-mediated T cell proliferation assays performed with cloned human cell lines showed that gp160/LAMP stimulated greater responses than did the wild type gp160. Moreover, mice vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia expressing gp160/LAMP had greater gp160-specific lymphoproliferation responses and higher titers of anti-V3 loop antibodies than mice vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia expressing wild type gp160."
12060749,Cell surface expression of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins is directed from intracellular CTLA-4-containing regulated secretory granules.,"The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV-1 is incorporated into virions that bud from the cell surface of infected T cells. With immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular membrane fractionation techniques, the intracellular fate of Env in the secretory pathway of HIV-1-infected T cells was evaluated. Rather than trafficking constitutively from the Golgi to the cell surface, Env is directed to intracellular CTLA-4-containing granules, whose recruitment to the cell surface is regulated. The use of the regulated pathway for intracellular Env storage before virion assembly holds implications for the staging of Env exposure at the cell surface of infected cells and of coordinating HIV virion assembly."
16223608,Improved intracellular delivery of glucocerebrosidase mediated by the HIV-1 TAT protein transduction domain.,"Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Gaucher disease designed to target glucocerebrosidase (GC) to macrophages via mannose-specific endocytosis is very effective in reversing hepatosplenomegaly, and normalizing hematologic parameters but is less effective in improving bone and lung involvement and ineffective in brain. Recombinant GCs containing an in-frame fusion to the HIV-1 trans-activator protein transduction domain (TAT) were expressed in eukaryotic cells in order to obtain active, normally glycosylated GC fusion proteins for enzyme uptake studies. Despite the absence of mannose-specific endocytic receptors on the plasma membranes of various fibroblasts, the recombinant GCs with C-terminal TAT fusions were readily internalized by these cells. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy demonstrated the recombinant TAT-fusion proteins with a mixed endosomal and lysosomal localization. Thus, TAT-modified GCs represent a novel strategy for a new generation of therapeutic enzymes for ERT for Gaucher disease."
8381971,Human immunodeficiency virus coat protein gp120 inhibits the beta-adrenergic regulation of astroglial and microglial functions.,"The goal of our study was to assess whether the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coat protein gp120 induces functional alterations in astrocytes and microglia, known for their reactivity and involvement in most types of brain pathology. We hypothesized that gp120-induced anomalies in glial functions, if present, might be mediated by changes in the levels of intracellular messengers important for signal transduction, such as cAMP. Acute (10 min) exposure of cultured rat cortical astrocytes or microglia to 100 pM gp120 caused only a modest (50-60%), though statistically significant, elevation in cAMP levels, which was antagonized by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol. More importantly, the protein substantially depressed [by 30% (astrocytes) and 50% (microglia)] the large increase in cAMP induced by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 nM), without affecting that induced by direct adenylate cyclase stimulation by forskolin. Qualitatively similar results were obtained using a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive human glioma cell line. The depression of the beta-adrenergic response had functional consequences in both astrocytes and microglia. In astrocytes we studied the phosphorylation of the two major cytoskeletal proteins, vimentin and GFAP, which is normally stimulated by isoproterenol, and found that gp120 partially (40-50%) prevented such stimulation. In microglial cells, which are the major producers of inflammatory cytokines within the brain, gp120 partially antagonized the negative beta-adrenergic modulation of lipopolysaccharide (10 ng/ml)-induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha. Our results suggest that, by interfering with the beta-adrenergic regulation of astrocytes and microglia, gp120 may alter astroglial ""reactivity"" and upset the delicate cytokine network responsible for the defense against viral and opportunistic infections."
10089566,Involvement of adenylate cyclase and p70(S6)-kinase activation in IL-10 up-regulation in human monocytes by gp41 envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"Our previous results show that recombinant gp41 (aa565-647), the extracellular domain of HIV-1 transmembrane glycoprotein, stimulates interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in human monocytes. The signal cascade transducing this effect is not yet clear. In this study, we examined whether gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation is mediated by the previously described synergistic activation of cAMP and NF-kappaB pathways. gp41 induced cAMP accumulation in monocytes in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 suppressed gp41-induced IL-10 production in monocytes. In contrast, gp41 failed to stimulate NF-kappaB binding activity in as much as no NF-kappaB bound to the main NF-kappaB-binding site 2 of the IL-10 promoter after addition of gp41. We also examined the involvement of other signal transduction pathways. Specific inhibitors of p70(S6)-kinase (rapamycin), and Gi protein (pertussis toxin), prevented induction of IL-10 production by gp41 in monocytes, while inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (wortmannin) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (PD 98059) did not. Thus HIV-1 gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation in monocytes may not involve NF-kappaB, MAPK, or PI 3-kinase activation, but rather may operate through activation of adenylate cyclase and pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi/Go protein to effect p70(S6)-kinase activation."
11834941,VPAC1 is a cellular neuroendocrine receptor expressed on T cells that actively facilitates productive HIV-1 infection.,"A lack of productive HIV-1 infection of Kit225 compared to Jurkat T cells, despite similar levels of CD4 and HIV-1 chemokine co-receptors, was found to correlate with the expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide receptor-1 (VPAC1). We therefore examined a role for this seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled neuroendocrine receptor in modulating HIV-1 infection."
9658081,Binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to CD4 and CXCR4 receptors differentially regulates expression of inflammatory genes and activates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway.,"We have previously shown that binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions to CD4 receptors stimulates association of Lck with Raf-1 and results in the activation of Raf-1 kinase in a Ras-independent manner. In the present study, we demonstrate that HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins of both T-cell-tropic and macrophagetropic strains rapidly activate the ERK/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and the binding of nuclear transcription factors (AP-1, NF-kappaB, and C/EBP) and stimulate expression of cytokine and chemokine genes. The activation of this signaling pathway requires functional CD4 receptors and is independent of binding to CXCR4. Binding of the natural ligand stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) to CXCR4, which inhibits entry of T-cell-tropic HIV-1, activates also the ERK/MAP kinase pathway. However, SDF-1 did not affect the CD4-mediated expression of cytokine and chemokine genes. These results provide firm molecular evidence that binding of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins to CD4 receptor initiates a signaling pathway(s) independent of the binding to the chemokine receptor that leads to the aberrant expression of inflammatory genes and may contribute significantly to HIV-1 replication as well as to deregulation of the immune system."
8599229,Nef-CD4 physical interaction sensed with the yeast two-hybrid system.,"HIV-1 Nef protein has been known to induce downmodulation of CD4 receptor. In order to test whether the two proteins physically interact, the yeast two-hybrid system was exploited. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain carrying a GAL4-responsive lacZ fusion gene was cotransformed with plasmids in which the Nef and the CD4 cytoplasmic domain (CD4cd) coding sequences were fused to either the DNA binding (DB) or the activation (A) moiety of the GAL4 transcriptional activator. Both the DB-Nef + A-CD4cd and the DB-CD4cd + A-Nef combinations activated the reporter gene, weakly but specifically, as inferred by comparison with a number of controls. Reporter activation was similary observed when DB-Nef was cotransfected with the fusion A-CD4cd(aa 1-23). On the contrary, the combination DB-Nef + A-CD4cd(aa 24-40) was inactive. Also, mutating the CD4cd Leu20-Leu21 motif (known to be essential for both physiological and Nef-induced CD4 endocytosis) to Ala20-Ala21 abolished the GAL4 activity of DB-Nef + A-CD4cd. None of six DB-Nef derivatives in which Nef was partially deleted activated specifically the reporter when coexpressed with A-CD4cd. These findings suggest that CD4cd and Nef directly interact and that a largely complete Nef is required for the interaction. CD4cd aa 1-23 are sufficient for binding; in particular, the Leu20-Leu21 motif is essential. One can infer from these data that: (i) Nef-induced CD4 downmodulation involves a direct CD4-Nef contact and (ii) CD4cd Leu20-Leu21 is required in Nef-induced downmodulation, not simply as an endocytosis signal, but also as an essential component of the Nef-binding moiety."
8551605,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr protein binds to the uracil DNA glycosylase DNA repair enzyme.,"The role of the accessory gene product Vpr during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection remains unclear. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify cellular proteins that interact with Vpr and could be involved in its function. A cDNA clone which encodes the human uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG), a DNA repair enzyme involved in removal of uracil in DNA, has been isolated. Interaction between Vpr and UNG has been demonstrated by in vitro protein-protein binding assays using translated, radiolabeled Vpr and UNG recombinant proteins expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Conversely, purified UNG has been demonstrated to interact with Vpr recombinant protein expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that Vpr and UNG are associated within cells expressing Vpr. By using a panel of C- and N-terminally deleted Vpr mutants, we have determined that the core protein of Vpr, spanning amino acids 15 to 77, is involved in the interaction with UNG. We also demonstrate by in vitro experiments that the enzymatic activity of UNG is retained upon interaction with Vpr."
15708996,Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 binds to 14-3-3 proteins and facilitates complex formation with Cdc25C: implications for cell cycle arrest.,"Vpr and selected mutants were used in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid screen to identify cellular interactors. We found Vpr interacted with 14-3-3 proteins, a family regulating a multitude of proteins in the cell. Vpr mutant R80A, which is inactive in cell cycle arrest, did not interact with 14-3-3. 14-3-3 proteins regulate the G(2)/M transition by inactivating Cdc25C phosphatase via binding to the phosphorylated serine residue at position 216 of Cdc25C. 14-3-3 overexpression in human cells synergized with Vpr in the arrest of cell cycle. Vpr did not arrest efficiently cells not expressing 14-3-3sigma. This indicated that a full complement of 14-3-3 proteins is necessary for optimal Vpr function on the cell cycle. Mutational analysis showed that the C-terminal portion of Vpr, known to harbor its cell cycle-arresting activity, bound directly to the C-terminal part of 14-3-3, outside of its phosphopeptide-binding pocket. Vpr expression shifted localization of the mutant Cdc25C S216A to the cytoplasm, indicating that Vpr promotes the association of 14-3-3 and Cdc25C, independently of the presence of serine 216. Immunoprecipitations of cell extracts indicated the presence of triple complexes (Vpr/14-3-3/Cdc25C). These results indicate that Vpr promotes cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M phase by facilitating association of 14-3-3 and Cdc25C independently of the latter's phosphorylation status."
9371639,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr interacts with HHR23A, a cellular protein implicated in nucleotide excision DNA repair.","The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vpr gene is an evolutionarily conserved gene among the primate lentiviruses HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency viruses. One of the unique functions attributed to the vpr gene product is the arrest of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Here we demonstrate that Vpr interacts physically with HHR23A, one member of an evolutionarily conserved gene family involved in nucleotide excision repair. Interaction of Vpr with HHR23A was initially identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and was confirmed by the demonstration of direct binding between bacterially expressed recombinant and transiently expressed or chemically synthesized protein products. Visualization of HHR23A and Vpr by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy indicates that the two proteins colocalize at or about the nuclear membrane. We also map the Vpr-binding domain in HHR23A to a C-terminal 45-amino-acid region of the protein previously shown to have homology to members of the ubiquitination pathway. Overexpression of HHR23A and a truncated derivative which includes the Vpr-binding domain results in a partial alleviation of the G2 arrest induced by Vpr, suggesting that the interaction between Vpr and HHR23A is critical for cell cycle arrest induced by Vpr. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that Vpr interferes with the normal function of a protein or proteins involved in the DNA repair process and, thus, in the transmission of signals that allow cells to transit from the G2 to the M phase of the cell cycle."
9520381,"HIV-1 Vpr interacts with a human 34-kDa mov34 homologue, a cellular factor linked to the G2/M phase transition of the mammalian cell cycle.","Several important and possibly interrelated functions have been identified for the HIV-1 accessory gene product Vpr. These include import of the HIV reverse transcription complex into the nucleus of nondividing cells, cellular differentiation including cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase border, immune suppression, and enhancement of virus replication. We have cloned a candidate Vpr ligand, termed human Vpr interacting protein (hVIP/MOV34), by using a yeast two-hybrid assay. This gene is homologous to a simultaneously identified 34-kDa human mov34 homologue. The MOV34 family includes proteins that function as transcriptional and proteolytic regulators of cell growth and differentiation. We demonstrate direct interactions between the putative ligand hVIP/MOV34 and Vpr in vitro and in vivo. hVIP/MOV34 localizes to the nucleus and appears to function as a component of the cell cycle cascade. We observe an association between the induction of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase border by Vpr and a change in the subcellular localization of hVIP/MOV34 from a nuclear to a perinuclear localization. This was further associated with the inhibition of maturation promoting factor-associated histone H1 kinase activity. We conclude that hVIP/MOV34 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and a likely cellular cofactor for HIV-1 Vpr."
15723517,Interactions of the HIV-1 Tat and RAP74 proteins with the RNA polymerase II CTD phosphatase FCP1.,"FCP1, a phosphatase specific for the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, is regulated by the HIV-1 Tat protein, CK2, TFIIB, and the large subunit of TFIIF (RAP74). We have characterized the interactions of Tat and RAP74 with the BRCT-containing central domain of FCP1 (FCP1(562)(-)(738)). We demonstrated that FCP1 is required for Tat-mediated transactivation in vitro and that amino acids 562-685 of FCP1 are necessary for Tat interaction in yeast two-hybrid studies. From sequence alignments, we identified a conserved acidic/hydrophobic region in FCP1 adjacent to its highly conserved BRCT domain. In vitro binding studies with purified proteins indicate that HIV-1 Tat interacts with both the acidic/hydrophobic region and the BRCT domain of FCP1, whereas RAP74(436)(-)(517) interacts solely with a portion of the acidic/hydrophobic region containing a conserved LXXLL-like motif. HIV-1 Tat inhibits the binding of RAP74(436)(-)(517) to FCP1. In a companion paper (K. Abbott et al. (2005) Enhanced Binding of RNAPII CTD Phosphatase FCP1 to RAP74 Following CK2 Phosphorylation, Biochemistry 44, 2732-2745, we identified a novel CK2 site adjacent to this conserved LXXLL-like motif. Phosphorylation of FCP1(562)(-)(619) by CK2 at this site increases binding to RAP74(436)(-)(517), but this phosphorylation is inhibited by Tat. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms by which Tat inhibits the FCP1 CTD phosphatase activity and by which FCP1 mediates transcriptional activation by Tat. In addition to increasing our understanding of the role of HIV-1 Tat in transcriptional regulation, this study defines a clear role for regions adjacent to the BRCT domain in promoting important protein-protein interactions."
16731905,"Identification of a novel human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase interactor, Gemin2, that facilitates efficient viral cDNA synthesis in vivo.","Retroviral integrase (IN) catalyzes the integration of viral cDNA into a host chromosome. Additional roles have been suggested for IN, including uncoating, reverse transcription, and nuclear import of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Here, using a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a survival motor neuron (SMN)-interacting protein 1 (Gemin2) that binds to HIV-1 IN. Reduction of Gemin2 with small interfering RNA duplexes (siGemin2) dramatically reduced HIV-1 infection in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages and also reduced viral cDNA synthesis. In contrast, siGemin2 did not affect HIV-1 expression from the integrated proviral DNA. Although Gemin2 was undetectable in cell-free viral particles, coimmunoprecipitation experiments using FLAG-tagged Gemin2 strongly suggested that Gemin2 interacts with the incoming viral genome through IN. Further experiments reducing SMN or other SMN-interacting proteins suggested that Gemin2 might act on HIV-1 either alone or with unknown proteins to facilitate efficient viral cDNA synthesis soon after infection. Thus, we provide the evidence for a novel host protein that binds to HIV-1 IN and facilitates viral cDNA synthesis and subsequent steps that precede integration in vivo."
7801128,Binding and stimulation of HIV-1 integrase by a human homolog of yeast transcription factor SNF5.,"Upon entry into a host cell, retroviruses direct the reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome and the establishment of an integrated proviral DNA. The retroviral integrase protein (IN) is responsible for the insertion of the viral DNA into host chromosomal targets. The two-hybrid system was used to identify a human gene product that binds tightly to the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) integrase in vitro and stimulates its DNA-joining activity. The sequence of the gene suggests that the protein is a human homolog of yeast SNF5, a transcriptional activator required for high-level expression of many genes. The gene, termed INI1 (for integrase interactor 1), may encode a nuclear factor that promotes integration and targets incoming viral DNA to active genes."
9882340,Interactions of the cytoplasmic domains of human and simian retroviral transmembrane proteins with components of the clathrin adaptor complexes modulate intracellular and cell surface expression of envelope glycoproteins.,"The cytoplasmic domains of the transmembrane (TM) envelope proteins (TM-CDs) of most retroviruses have a Tyr-based motif, YXXO, in their membrane-proximal regions. This signal is involved in the trafficking and endocytosis of membrane receptors via clathrin-associated AP-1 and AP-2 adaptor complexes. We have used CD8-TM-CD chimeras to investigate the role of the Tyr-based motif of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and human T-leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) TM-CDs in the cell surface expression of the envelope glycoprotein. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies showed that this motif is a major determinant of the cell surface expression of the CD8-HTLV chimera. The YXXO motif also plays a key role in subcellular distribution of the envelope of lentiviruses HIV-1 and SIV. However, these viruses, which encode TM proteins with a long cytoplasmic domain, have additional determinants distal to the YXXO motif that participate in regulating cell surface expression. We have also used the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays to demonstrate that all three retroviral YXXO motifs interact with the micro1 and micro2 subunits of AP complexes and that the C-terminal regions of HIV-1 and SIV TM proteins interact with the beta2 adaptin subunit. The TM-CDs of HTLV-1, HIV-1, and SIV also interact with the whole AP complexes. These results clearly demonstrate that the cell surface expression of retroviral envelope glycoproteins is governed by interactions with adaptor complexes. The YXXO-based signal is the major determinant of this interaction for the HTLV-1 TM, which contains a short cytoplasmic domain, whereas the lentiviruses HIV-1 and SIV have additional determinants distal to this signal that are also involved."
10420987,The cytoplasmic domain of HIV-1 gp41 interacts with the carboxyl-terminal region of alpha-catenin.,"To know the cellular protein interactions with the viral protein can give an insight into the molecular mechanisms of the virus life cycle. As the function of the cytoplasmic domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 is not known clearly, we searched for a cellular protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the HIV-1 gp41 using the yeast two-hybrid assay system. Screening of HeLa cell cDNA library yielded alpha-catenin cDNA. The cytoplasmic domain of the HIV-1 gp41 and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) gp41 were able to interact with the carboxyl-terminal region of alpha-catenin specifically. Mapping of the interaction sites revealed that the interaction between the domain containing the second helix structure from the carboxyl-terminus of HIV-1 gp41 and the carboxyl-terminal region of alpha-catenin was stronger than other domains of gp41."
16111829,Differential involvement of p38 and JNK MAP kinases in HIV-1 Tat and gp120-induced apoptosis and neurite degeneration in striatal neurons.,"The role of p38 and c-jun-N-terminal kinases 1/2, members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, in mediating the toxic effects of human immunodeficiency virus-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) and gp120 were explored in primary mouse striatal neurons in vitro. Both Tat and gp120 caused significant increases in p38 and c-jun-N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, caspase-3 activity, neurite losses and cell death in striatal neurons. Tat-induced increases in caspase-3 activity were significantly attenuated by an inhibitor of c-jun-N-terminal kinase (anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one), but not by an inhibitor of p38 ([4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsul-finylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1 H-imidazole]), mitogen-activated protein kinase. However, despite preventing increases in caspase-3 activity, c-jun-N-terminal kinase inhibition failed to avert Tat-induced neuronal losses suggesting that the reductions in caspase-3 activity were insufficient to prevent cell death caused by Tat. Alternatively, gp120-induced increases in caspase-3 activity, neurite losses and neuronal death were prevented by p38, but not c-jun-N-terminal kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition. Our findings suggest that gp120 induces neuronal dysfunction and death through actions at p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, while Tat kills neurons through actions that are independent of p38 or c-jun-N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase, or through the concurrent activation of multiple proapoptotic pathways."
2076345,Temporal expression of HIV-1 envelope proteins in baculovirus-infected insect cells: implications for glycosylation and CD4 binding.,"Three different human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) envelope derived recombinant proteins and the full length human CD4 polypeptide were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. DNA constructs encoding CD4, gp120, gp160, and gp160 delta (full length gp160 minus the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region of gp41) were cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL941 or a derivative and used to generate recombinant viruses in a cotransfection with DNA from Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV). Western blotting of cell extracts of the recombinant HIV-1 proteins showed that for each construct two major bands specifically reacted with anti-HIV-1 envelope antiserum. These bands corresponded to glycosylated and nonglycosylated versions of the HIV proteins as determined by 3H-mannose labeling and tunicamycin treatment of infected cells. A time course of HIV envelope expression revealed that at early times post-infection (24 hours) the proteins were fully glycosylated and soluble in nonionic detergents. However, at later times postinfection (48 hours), expression levels of recombinant protein reached a maximum but most of the increase was due to a rise in the level of the nonglycosylated species, which was largely insoluble in nonionic detergents. Thus, it appears that Sf9 cells cannot process large amounts of glycosylated recombinant proteins efficiently. As a measure of biological activity, the CD4 binding ability of both glycosylated and nonglycosylated recombinant HIV envelope proteins was tested in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. The results showed that CD4 and the glycosylated versions of recombinant gp120 or gp160 delta specifically associated with one another in this analysis. Nonglycosylated gp120 or gp160 delta proteins from tunicamycin-treated cultures did immunoprecipitate with anti-HIV-1 antiserum but did not interact with CD4. We conclude that production of native HIV envelope proteins, as measured by addition of carbohydrate side chains and ability to bind CD4, peaks early after infection in baculovirus-infected insect cells."
12083833,Involvement of integrin alphavbeta3 in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in monocytes.,"Attachment of HIV to macrophages is a critical early event in the establishment of infection. In the present study, we demonstrate the involvement of integrin alphavbeta3 (vitronectin receptor) in HIV infection of peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. Culturing monocytes in the presence of M-CSF for 3 days upregulated expression of the alphav-containing integrins, alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5. The increase in alphavbeta3 expression was accompanied by increased HIV-1 replication by monocytes. Immunoblot analysis showed that purified HIV-gp120 protein interacted with CD4 and alphavbeta3 in immunoprecipitation experiments. Neutralizing antibodies against the alphavbeta3 integrin interfered with the coprecipitation of alphavbeta3 with an anti-gp120 antibody and substantially inhibited HIV infection of monocytes. Neutralizing antibodies against alphavbeta5 or beta1 integrins did not significantly affect HIV infection. These results indicate that HIV infection of primary monocytes requires differentiation of these cells and may involve alphavbeta3 interaction with the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 for productive infection."
9263011,gp 120s derived from four syncytium-inducing HIV-1 strains induce different patterns of CD4 association with lymphocyte surface molecules.,"This work extends our previous finding that lymphocyte treatment with gp120IIIB specifically induces CD4 association with several surface molecules to other molecules and to three other gp120s from different HIV-1 strains. The ability to induce this association was displayed by the four gp120s employed, i.e. gp120IIIB, gp120SF2, gp120MN and gp120(451), and the association patterns were different, as shown by both co-capping and immunoprecipitation. Co-capping showed that all four gp120s significantly potentiated CD4 association with CD3, CD45RA, CD45RB, CD38, CD26, CD59 and class I MHC molecules. By contrast, CD4 association with CD95 was induced only by gp120(451) and gp120MN; that with CD11a only by gp120SF2 and gp120MN; and that with CD27 and CD45RO only by gp120MN and gp120(451) respectively. All gp120s induced significant CD4 association with CD49d, but gp120SF2 displayed a significantly weaker effect than gp120IIIB. Induction of association was not mediated by inside-out signaling via the CD4-associated tyrosine kinase p58lck, since it was not inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbymicin and genistein, nor by CD45 bridging between CD4 and the associating molecule, since similar patterns of association were detected IN cells expressing different CD45 isoform patterns. Moreover, it was not mediated by chemokine receptors interacting with the gp120 V3 loop, since RANTES did not alter the gp120-induced CD4 association pattern. By contrast, the observation that gp120s from four HIV-1 strains induce different CD4 association patterns suggests that gp120 directly interacts with the associating molecules, possibly via their hypervariable regions."
15047828,CD4-independent infection of astrocytes by human immunodeficiency virus type 1: requirement for the human mannose receptor.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection occurs in the central nervous system and causes a variety of neurobehavioral and neuropathological disorders. Both microglia, the residential macrophages in the brain, and astrocytes are susceptible to HIV-1 infection. Unlike microglia that express and utilize CD4 and chemokine coreceptors CCR5 and CCR3 for HIV-1 infection, astrocytes fail to express CD4. Astrocytes express several chemokine coreceptors; however, the involvement of these receptors in astrocyte HIV-1 infection appears to be insignificant. In the present study using an expression cloning strategy, the cDNA for the human mannose receptor (hMR) was found to be essential for CD4-independent HIV-1 infectivity. Ectopic expression of functional hMR rendered U87.MG astrocytic cells susceptible to HIV-1 infection, whereas anti-hMR serum and hMR-specific siRNA blocked HIV-1 infection in human primary astrocytes. In agreement with these findings, hMR bound to HIV-1 virions via the abundant and highly mannosylated sugar moieties of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion. Moreover, hMR-mediated HIV-1 infection was dependent upon endocytic trafficking as assessed by transmission electron microscopy, as well as inhibition of viral entry by endosomo- and lysosomotropic drugs. Taken together, these results demonstrate the direct involvement of hMR in HIV-1 infection of astrocytes and suggest that HIV-1 interaction with hMR plays an important role in HIV-1 neuropathogenesis."
7535922,The large subunit of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase interacts with beta-actin.,HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is a dimeric enzyme mainly involved in the replication of the viral genome. A filamentous phage cDNA expression library from human lymphocytes was used to select cellular proteins interacting with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase Affinity selections using the bacterially expressed monomeric large subunit of reverse transcriptase (p66) yielded host beta-actin. This clone was expressed as glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein which was identified by using a specific antibody against beta-actin. Furthermore we show that also the eukaryotic beta-actin binds to either the large subunit of reverse transcriptase or to the Pol precursor polyprotein in vitro. The reverse transcriptase/beta-actin interaction might be important for the secretion of HIV-1 virions.
10807185,"HIV-1 envelope protein gp41 modulates expression of interleukin-10 and chemokine receptors on monocytes, astrocytes and neurones.",To analyse the effect of HIV-1 transmembrane protein gp41 on cytokine production and chemokine receptor expression in blood and brain.
15790518,Human immunodeficiency virus gp120 downregulates CD1d cell surface expression.,"CD1d is an MHC class I-like surface molecule that presents endogenous glycoplipid antigens. The effect of HIV infection on CD1d surface expression has not yet been reported. FACS analysis revealed significantly lower levels of CD1d on CD14(+) monocytes from HIV-infected subjects compared to HIV-infected subjects on HAART and healthy controls. CD1d expression correlated inversely with viral load in infected individuals. CD1d surface expression on human cell lines was downregulated after infection with M-tropic HIV, T-tropic HIV, or after exposure to HIV gp120 in vitro. These data suggest that CD1d-mediated responses are altered during HIV infection and may thus contribute to the global immunodeficiency seen in these patients."
8267903,Complement activation upon binding of mannan-binding protein to HIV envelope glycoproteins.,"Retroviruses can activate the complement system in the absence of antibodies, and the purpose of this study was to examine whether the serum collection, mannan-binding protein (MBP), could mediate such complement activation."
8195203,Biochemical mechanism of HIV-I Vpr function. Specific interaction with a cellular protein.,"vpr is an accessory gene of human immunodeficiency virus I (HIV-I). Although unnecessary for viral replication in T cell lines, growing evidence suggests that it is essential for virus replication in monocytes/macrophages and for replication in vivo. We expressed HIV-I vpr in Escherichia coli and purified Vpr by affinity chromatography. In a coprecipitation assay, the purified Vpr interacted specifically with a cellular protein designated as Vpr-interacting protein, or RIP. Mutational analysis suggested that this interaction required a domain rich in leucine/isoleucine residues and highly conserved between HIV-I and SIVmac Vprs. During transient expression in mammalian cells, HIV-I Vpr was localized in the nucleus. However, mutational analysis failed to identify in Vpr a typical nuclear localization signal rich in basic amino acid residues. Instead, Vpr nuclear localization seemed to correlate with Vpr interaction with RIP. Mutations in the C-terminal 20-amino acid region containing a cryptic nuclear localization signal did not abolish Vpr nuclear localization or interaction with RIP, whereas point mutations in the leucine/isoleucine-rich domain abolished Vpr interaction with RIP and rendered Vpr unstable during transient expression. These results suggest that RIP may be involved in Vpr function."
11689615,Functional interactions of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase with human and yeast HSP60.,"Integration of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA in the nuclear genome is catalyzed by the retroviral integrase (IN). In addition to IN, viral and cellular proteins associated in the high-molecular-weight preintegration complex have been suggested to be involved in this process. In an attempt to define host factors interacting with IN, we used an in vitro system to identify cellular proteins in interaction with HIV-1 IN. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was chosen since (i) its complete sequence has been established and the primary structure of all the putative proteins from this eucaryote has been deduced, (ii) there is a significant degree of homology between human and yeast proteins, and (iii) we have previously shown that the expression of HIV-1 IN in yeast induces a lethal phenotype. Strong evidences suggest that this lethality is linked to IN activity in infected human cells where integration requires the cleavage of genomic DNA. Using IN-affinity chromatography we identified four yeast proteins interacting with HIV-1 IN, including the yeast chaperonin yHSP60, which is the counterpart of human hHSP60. Yeast lethality induced by HIV-1 IN was abolished when a mutated HSP60 was coexpressed, therefore suggesting that both proteins interact in vivo. Besides interacting with HIV-1 IN, the hHSP60 was able to stimulate the in vitro processing and joining activities of IN and protected this enzyme from thermal denaturation. In addition, the functional human HSP60-HSP10 complex in the presence of ATP was able to recognize the HIV-1 IN as a substrate."
16928883,Comparison of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-specific inhibitory activities in saliva and other human mucosal fluids.,"Several human mucosal fluids are known to possess an innate ability to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and replication in vitro. This study compared the HIV-1 inhibitory activities of several mucosal fluids, whole, submandibular/sublingual (sm/sl), and parotid saliva, breast milk, colostrum, seminal plasma, and cervicovaginal secretions, from HIV-1-seronegative donors by using a 3-day microtiter infection assay. A wide range of HIV-1 inhibitory activity was exhibited in all mucosal fluids tested, with some donors exhibiting high levels of activity while others showed significantly lower levels. Colostrum, whole milk, and whole saliva possessed the highest levels of anti-HIV-1 activity, seminal fluid, cervicovaginal secretions, and sm/sl exhibited moderate levels, and parotid saliva consistently demonstrated the lowest levels of HIV-1 inhibition. Fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration studies revealed the presence of at least three distinct peaks of inhibitory activity against HIV-1 in saliva and breast milk. Incubation of unfractionated and fractionated whole saliva with antibodies raised against human lactoferrin (hLf), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and, to a lesser extent, MG2 (high-molecular-weight mucinous glycoprotein) reduced the HIV-1 inhibitory activity significantly. The results suggest that hLf and SLPI are two key components responsible for HIV-1 inhibitory activity in different mucosal secretions. The variation in HIV inhibitory activity between the fluids and between individuals suggests that there may be major differences in susceptibility to HIV infection depending both on the individual and on the mucosal fluid involved."
2355006,Assignment of intrachain disulfide bonds and characterization of potential glycosylation sites of the type 1 recombinant human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein (gp120) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.,"This report describes the structural characterization of the recombinant envelope glycoprotein (rgp120) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 produced by expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Enzymatic cleavage of rgp120 and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography were used to confirm the primary structure of the protein, to assign intrachain disulfide bonds, and to characterize potential sites for N-glycosylation. All of the tryptic peptides identified were consistent with the primary structure predicted from the cDNA sequence. Tryptic mapping studies combined with treatment of isolated peptides with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or with peptide:N-glycosidase F followed by endoproteinase Asp-N permitted the assignment of all nine intrachain disulfide bonds of rgp120. The 24 potential sites for N-glycosylation were characterized by determining the susceptibilities of the attached carbohydrate structures to peptide:N-glycosidase F and to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. Tryptic mapping of enzymatically deglycosylated rgp120 was used in conjunction with Edman degradation and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of individually treated peptides to determine which of these sites are glycosylated and what types of structures are present. The results indicate that all 24 sites of gp120 are utilized, including 13 that contain complex-type oligosaccharides as the predominant structures, and 11 that contain primarily high mannose-type and/or hybrid-type oligosaccharide structures."
8218172,Site-specific N-glycosylation and oligosaccharide structures of recombinant HIV-1 gp120 derived from a baculovirus expression system.,"We report the complete structures of the N-linked oligosaccharides and the site-specificity of the N-glycosylation of recombinant gp120 (rgp120) of the HIV-1 BH8 isolate produce by a baculovirus expression system. Glycopeptides derived from the tryptic digests of intact rgp120 or of cyanogen bromide-generated fragments of rgp120 were isolated by their binding to concanavalin A-Sepharose and were purified by reversed-phase HPLC. The isolated glycopeptides were treated with PNGase F, releasing the carbohydrate moiety while converting Asn to Asp, and identified by amino acid analysis and/or peptide sequencing. Our results indicate that all 22 potential N-glycosylation sites in the rgp120 sequence are utilized. We did not detect N-acetylgalactosamine in rgp120, indicating that the glycoprotein lacks typical O-linked oligosaccharides. To investigate the oligosaccharide structures at the sites of glycosylation, we determined the carbohydrate composition for each site and characterized the oligosaccharides by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and by oligosaccharide mapping using high pH anion-exchange chromatography. Mannose and N-acetylglucosamine were the only sugars observed in the intact rgp120 and likewise in individual glycopeptides. All glycopeptides derived from rgp120 contained high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharides, ranging from GlcNAc2Man5 to GlcNAc2Man9. However, different glycosylation sites showed varied degrees of processing of the high mannose-type oligosaccharides, as characterized by the ratio of GlcNAc2Man8-9 to GlcNAc2Man5-7. These results demonstrate that N-glycosylation of rgp120 in the baculovirus expression system occurs at all potential sites and is site specific in terms of oligosaccharide structures."
2341393,Diversity of oligosaccharide structures on the envelope glycoprotein gp 120 of human immunodeficiency virus 1 from the lymphoblastoid cell line H9. Presence of complex-type oligosaccharides with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residues.,"The N-linked oligosaccharide structures on the envelope glycoprotein gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus 1 derived from chronically infected lymphoblastoid (H9) cells have been investigated by enzymatic microsequencing after release from protein by hydrazinolysis, labeling with NaB3H4, and chromatography on adsorbent columns of Phaseolus vulgaris erythrophytohemagglutinin and Ricinus communis agglutinin (Mr 120,000) and on Bio-Gel P-4. A substantially greater diversity of oligosaccharide structures was detected than among those released by hydrazinolysis from recombinant gp120 produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and investigated by similar procedures (Mizuochi, T., Spellman, M.W., Larkin, M., Solomon, J., Basa, L.J., and Feizi, T. (1988) Biochem J. 254, 599-603) and among those released by endoglycosidases from virus-derived gp120 isolated from infected H9 cells after metabolic labeling with D-[2-3H]mannose or D-[6-3H]glucosamine (Geyer, H., Holschbach, L., Hunsmann, G., and Schneider, J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11760-11767). In this study, 16% of the oligosaccharides were identified as complex-type bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary sialo-oligosaccharides with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residues. Such structures were lacking on recombinant gp120 and could not be detected on the metabolically labeled, virus-derived glycoprotein. As in the earlier investigations, complex-type chains lacking bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residues, hybrid-type chains, and a series of high mannose-type structures with 5-9 mannose residues were identified. In addition, an array of complex-type chains having one or more outer chains with beta-galactosyl residues were detected in this study, but with additional substitutions that require further investigation. The number of potential N-glycosylation sites on gp120 is on the order of 20, but the oligosaccharide structures are far more numerous. Thus, the salient conclusion from this and earlier investigations is that alternative structures occur on at least some of the glycosylation sites and that numerous glycosylation variants of this glycoprotein are produced even within a single cell line. Since the glycosylation is the product of host cell glycosyltransferases, an even greater number of glycosylation variants of gp120 are predicted to arise from the heterogeneous cell populations harboring the virus in in vivo infection."
15644496,Glycosaminoglycans and protein disulfide isomerase-mediated reduction of HIV Env.,"Conformational changes within the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) surface glycoprotein gp120 result from binding to the lymphocyte surface receptors and trigger gp41-mediated virus/cell membrane fusion. The triggering of fusion requires cleavage of two of the nine disulfide bonds of gp120 by a cell-surface protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI). Soluble glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulfate bind gp120 via V3 and, possibly, a CD4-induced domain. They exert anti-HIV activity by interfering with the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env)/cell-surface interaction. Env also binds cell-surface glycosaminoglycans. Here, using surface plasmon resonance, we observed an inverse relationship between heparin binding by gp120 and its thiol content. In vitro, and in conditions in which gp120 could bind CD4, heparin and heparan sulfate reduced PDI-mediated gp120 reduction by approximately 80%. Interaction of Env with the surface of lymphocytes treated using sodium chlorate, an inhibitor of glycosaminoglycan synthesis, led to gp120 reduction. We conclude that besides their capacity to block Env/cell interaction, soluble glycosaminoglycans can effect anti-HIV activity via interference with PDI-mediated gp120 reduction. In contrast, their presence at the cell surface is dispensable for Env reduction during the course of interaction with the lymphocyte surface. This work suggests that the reduction of exofacial proteins in various diseases can be inhibited by compounds targeting the substrates (not by targeting PDI, as is usually done), and that glycosaminoglycans that primarily protect proteins by preserving them from proteolysis also have a role in preventing reduction."
8794361,N-butyldeoxynojirimycin-mediated inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus entry correlates with changes in antibody recognition of the V1/V2 region of gp120.,"The alpha-glucosidase inhibitor N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) is an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication and HIV-induced syncytium formation in vitro. Although NB-DNJ appears to inhibit HIV entry at the level of post-CD4 binding (P.B. Fischer, M. Collin, G.B. Karlsson, W. James, T.D. Butters, S.J. Davis, S. Gordon, R.A. Dwek, and F.M. Platt, J. Virol. 69:5791-5797, 1995), the exact mechanism of action remains to be established. In this study we have examined the effect of NB-DNJ on the structure of recombinant gp120 (rgpl20), expressed in CHO cells, by using a panel of 40 monoclonal antibodies. The levels of binding of antibodies to rgp120 produced in the presence [rgpl20(+)] and absence [rgpl20(-)] of NB-DNJ were compared by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore; Pharmacia). The results showed an increase in the binding to rgp120(+) of antibodies directed against the C1 and C2 regions and a decrease in the binding of antibodies directed against the V1/V2 loops compared with antibody binding to rgpl20(-). A decrease in the binding to rgpl20(+) of antibodies directed against discontinuous epitopes was also observed. No differences were seen in the binding of antibodies directed against the crown of the V3 loop and the C4 region of gp120. Treatment of rgpl20 with alpha-glucosidases I and II had no effect on the differential binding observed, whereas treatment with sialidase abolished the differences seen in the binding of antibodies directed against the C1 and C2 regions of gp120. In addition to these findings, rgpl20(+) showed increased sensitivity to proteases released by CHO cells during expression, as well as to exogenous thrombin. Taken together, the data presented in this paper suggest that production of gp120 in the presence of NB-DNJ affects the conformation of the Vl/V2 loops of gpl20, as well as the overall charge of the C1 and C2 regions. These effects may play a role in the previously described NB-DNJ-mediated inhibition of HIV entry at the level of post-CD4 binding."
16289656,Inhibition of HIV-1 virus replication using small soluble Tat peptides.,"Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a significant reduction in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality, unfortunately, many patients discontinue their initial HAART regimen, resulting in development of viral resistance. During HIV infection, the viral activator Tat is needed for viral progeny formation, and the basic and core domains of Tat are the most conserved parts of the protein. Here, we show that a Tat 41/44 peptide from the core domain can inhibit HIV-1 gene expression and replication. The peptides are not toxic to cells and target the Cdk2/Cyclin E complex, inhibiting the phosphorylation of serine 5 of RNAPII. Using the Cdk2 X-ray crystallography structure, we found that the low-energy wild-type peptides could bind to the ATP binding pocket, whereas the mutant peptide bound to the Cdk2 interface. Finally, we show that these peptides do not allow loading of the catalytic domain of the cdk/cyclin complex onto the HIV-1 promoter in vivo."
16188969,Distinct functional sites for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha on CXCR4 transmembrane helical domains.,"The entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into the cell is initiated by the interaction of the viral surface envelope protein with two cell surface components of the target cell, CD4 and a chemokine coreceptor, usually CXCR4 or CCR5. The natural ligand of CXCR4 is stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha). Whereas the overlap between HIV-1 and SDF-1alpha functional sites on the extracellular domains of CXCR4 has been well documented, it has yet to be determined whether there are sites in the transmembrane (TM) helices of CXCR4 important for HIV-1 and/or SDF-1alpha functions, and if such sites do exist, whether they are overlapping or distinctive for the separate functions of CXCR4. For this study, by employing alanine-scanning mutagenesis, (125)I-SDF-1alpha competition binding, Ca(2+) mobilization, and cell-cell fusion assays, we found that the mutation of many CXCR4 TM residues, including Tyr(45), His(79), Asp(97), Pro(163), Trp(252), Tyr(255), Asp(262), Glu(288), His(294), and Asn(298), could selectively decrease HIV-1-mediated cell fusion but not the binding activity of SDF-1alpha. Phe(87) and Phe(292), which were involved in SDF-1alpha binding, did not play a significant role in the coreceptor activity of CXCR4, further demonstrating the disconnection between physiological and pathological activities of CXCR4 TM domains. Our data also show that four mutations of the second extracellular loop, D182A, D187A, F189A, and P191A, could reduce HIV-1 entry without impairing either ligand binding or signaling. Taken together, our first detailed characterization of the different functional roles of CXCR4 TM domains may suggest a mechanistic basis for the discovery of new selective anti-HIV agents."
1282933,The gp120 glycoprotein of HIV-1 binds to sulfatide and to the myelin associated glycoprotein.,"We investigated the binding of the gp120 glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) to neural glycolipids and glycoproteins by ELISA. The gp120 protein bound to sulfatide (GalS), a sulfated glycolipid autoantigen implicated in sensory neuritis, and to the myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), an autoantigen in demyelinating neuropathy. Binding of gp120 to MAG was inhibited by the HNK-1 antibody, which recognizes a sulfated glucuronic acid epitope, suggesting that the interaction involves carbohydrate determinants. Sulfatide and MAG are potential receptors for gp120 in peripheral nerve and may have a role in the neuropathy associated with HIV-1 infection."
12608057,[Interaction of human apolipoprotein AI and HIV-1 envelope proteins with the native and recombinant CD4 receptors].,"The method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to show an interaction of soluble recombinant CD4-receptor (rsCD4) with human apolipoprotein A-1. Competitive interactions between envelope proteins VIH-1 (gp120 and gp41), on the one hand, and human apolipoprotein A-1 with CD4 receptor, present in the cellular membranes of line MT4 human lymphocytes, were demonstrated by the method of flow cytofluorimetry. It was suggested that the competitive interactions between the above proteins could manifest in respect to the apolipoprotein A-1 receptor, which affects the involvement of the latter in the regulation of protein biosynthesis and which leads to a decrease in the body weight of HIV-infected patients."
10499815,A 60 kD heat-shock protein-like molecule interacts with the HIV transmembrane glycoprotein gp41.,"The heat-shock protein hsp60 is typically found in mitochondria, but, in smaller amounts, also in the cell cytoplasm and associated with the cell membrane. Since heat-shock proteins are known to interact with a variety of molecules and since purified HIV-1 particles were described to contain hsp60 molecules, we tested the possibility that a previously described putative receptor for HIV transmembrane protein gp41 is identical to hsp60. The gp41-binding human protein P62 was purified from H9 and Raji cell lysates by a gp41-coupled affinity column. We could show crossreactivity of both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-hsp60 antibodies with the purified P62. In addition we analyzed binding of P18, a soluble gp41 fragment harboring the extracellular domain (Env aa539-684), to recombinant hsp60. Hsp60 bound well to P18-coated ELISA plates whereas HIV-1 surface protein gp120 induced no binding of hsp60. Preincubation of hsp60 with gp41 abolished the binding. The possible role of this molecule as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of HIV disease is discussed."
10725420,Interaction of mannose-binding lectin with primary isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is present in human serum and plays an important role in innate immunity by binding to carbohydrate on micro-organisms. Whereas the gp120/gp41 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) contains numerous N-linked glycosylation sites and many of these sites contain high-mannose glycans which could interact with MBL, the interaction between MBL and primary isolates (PI) of HIV-1 has not been studied. To determine if PI of HIV bind to MBL, a virus capture assay was developed in which virus was incubated in MBL-coated microtitre wells followed by detection of bound virus with an ELISA for p24 antigen. The X4 HIV-1(MN) T cell line-adapted strain and PI of HIV (R5 and X4) bound to MBL. Binding of virus to MBL was via the carbohydrate-recognition domain of MBL since binding did not occur in the absence of Ca(2+) and was blocked by preincubation of MBL-coated wells with soluble mannan. The interaction of virus with MBL-coated wells was also inhibited by preincubation of virus with soluble MBL, indicating that both immobilized and soluble forms of MBL bound to HIV. Although host cell glycoproteins are incorporated into the membrane of HIV, binding of virus to immobilized MBL required expression of gp120/gp41 on virus particles, suggesting the presence of either an unusually high carbohydrate density and/or a unique carbohydrate structure on gp120/gp41 that is the target of MBL. This study shows that PI of HIV bind to MBL and suggests that MBL can selectively interact with HIV in vivo via carbohydrate structures on gp120/gp41."
15288392,HIV-1 gp120 stimulates proinflammatory cytokine-mediated pain facilitation via activation of nitric oxide synthase-I (nNOS).,"It has become clear that spinal cord glia (microglia and astrocytes) importantly contribute to the creation of exaggerated pain responses. One model used to study this is peri-spinal (intrathecal, i.t.) administration of gp120, an envelope protein of HIV-1 known to activate glia. Previous studies demonstrated that i.t. gp120 produces pain facilitation via the release of glial proinflammatory cytokines. The present series of studies tested whether spinal nitric oxide (NO) contributes to i.t. gp120-induced mechanical allodynia and, if so, what effect NO has on spinal proinflammatory cytokines. gp120 stimulation of acutely isolated lumbar dorsal spinal cords released NO as well as proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL1), interleukin-6 (IL6)), thus identifying NO as a candidate mediator of gp120-induced behavioral effects. Behaviorally, identical effects were observed when gp120-induced mechanical allodynia was challenged by i.t. pre-treatment with either a broad-spectrum nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (L-NAME) or 7-NINA, a selective inhibitor of NOS type-I (nNOS). Both abolished gp120-induced mechanical allodynia. While the literature pre-dominantly documents that proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the production of NO rather than the reverse, here we show that gp120-induced NO increases proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels (RT-PCR) and both protein expression and protein release (serial ELISA). Furthermore, gp120 increases mRNA for IL1 converting enzyme and matrix metalloproteinase-9, enzymes responsible for activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines."
8976184,Cross-linking of Fas by antibodies to a peculiar domain of gp120 V3 loop can enhance T cell apoptosis in HIV-1-infected patients.,"Previous studies have demonstrated that T cell-reactive antibodies in HIV-1 infection contribute to lymphocyte depletion by cytotoxicity that involves differential membrane targets, such as the 43.5-kD receptor on CEM cells. Here, we show that these antibodies bind Fas as result of a molecular mimicry of the gp120. Both flow cytometry and immunoblotting using the human Fas-transfected mouse WC8 lymphoma revealed positive binding of immunoglobulin G from several patients to a 43.8-kD membrane receptor that also reacts with the CH11 anti-Fas monoclonal antibody. Specificity to Fas was further confirmed to chimeric recombinant human Fas-Fc by ELISA, whereas overlapping peptide mapping of a Fas domain (VEINCTR-N) shared by gp120 V3 loop demonstrated a predominant affinity to the full-length 10-mer peptide. Four anti-Fas affinity preparations greatly increased the subdiploid DNA peak of CEM cells similar to agonist ligands of Fas. In addition, anti-Fas immunoglobulin G strongly inhibited the [3H]thymidine uptake of CEM cells in proliferative assays, inducing a suppression as high as provoked by both CH11 mAb and recombinant human Fas ligand. Since anti-Fas were reactive to gp120, it is conceivable that antibodies binding that domain within the V3 region are effective cross-linkers of Fas and increase apoptosis in peripheral T cells. These results suggest that autologous stimulation of the Fas pathway, rather than of lymphocytotoxic antibodies, may aggravate lymphopenia in a number of HIV-1+ subjects."
15202998,ARF1 regulates Nef-induced CD4 degradation.,"The HIV Nef protein downregulates CD4 through sequential connection with clathrin-coated pits and the COP1 coatomer, resulting in accelerated endocytosis and lysosomal targeting."
10556093,Functional interaction between the cytoplasmic leucine-zipper domain of HIV-1 gp41 and p115-RhoGEF.,"The long cytoplasmic tail of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transmembrane protein gp41 (gp41C) is implicated in the replication and cytopathicity of HIV-1 [1]. Little is known about the specific functions of gp41C, however. HIV-1 or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mutants with defective gp41C have cell-type- or species-dependent phenotypes [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]. Thus, host factors are implicated in mediating the functions of gp41C. We report here that gp41C interacted with the carboxy-terminal regulatory domain of p115-RhoGEF [7], a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and activator of the RhoA GTPase, which regulates actin stress fiber formation, activation of serum response factor (SRF) and cell proliferation [8] [9]. We demonstrate that gp41C inhibited p115-mediated actin stress fiber formation and activation of SRF. An amphipathic helix region with a leucine-zipper motif in gp41C is involved in its interaction with p115. Mutations in gp41C leading to loss of interaction with p115 impaired HIV-1 replication in human T cells. These findings suggest that an important function of gp41C is to modulate the activity of p115-RhoGEF and they thus reveal a new potential anti-HIV-1 target."
12429730,Multiple determinants are involved in HIV coreceptor use as demonstrated by CCR4/CCL22 interaction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).,"Although a number of chemokine receptors display coreceptor activities in vitro, chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) remain the major coreceptors used by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In this study, we used an envelope-mediated fusion assay to demonstrate low CCR4 coreceptor activity with some primary HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus-1 (mac316) isolates in vitro. The coreceptor activity was sensitive to CCR4-specific antibodies and to the CCR4-specific chemokine ligand macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC)/chemokine ligand 22 (CCL22). Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; which express high levels of CCR4) with CCL22 caused down-modulation of endogenous CCR4 but had no significant effect on HIV-1 entry, suggesting that CCR4 may not be used as an entry coreceptor. Despite expression of other minor coreceptors on PBMCs, CCR5 and CXCR4 are preferentially used by HIV-1 isolates, as shown by chemokine-inhibition data. To determine the factors involved in this selective use, we analyzed CCR4 coreceptor activity and compared it with CCR5 use in PBMCs. We used a quantitative fluorescence-activated cell-sorting assay to estimate the numbers of CCR4 and CCR5 antibody-binding sites (ABS) on PBMCs. Although CCR4 was found on a higher percentage of CD4(+) cells, CCR5 ABS was twofold greater than CCR4 ABS on CD4(+) cells. Confocal microscopy revealed strong cell-surface CD4/CCR5 but weak CD4/CCR4 colocalization in PBMCs. Binding studies demonstrated that soluble gp120 had greater affinity to CCR5 than CCR4. The results suggested that coreceptor density, colocalization with CD4, and affinity of the viral gp120 to the coreceptor may determine preferential coreceptor use by HIV-1."
1535086,Internalization of HIV glycoprotein gp120 is associated with down-modulation of membrane CD4 and p56lck together with impairment of T cell activation.,"We previously demonstrated that long term treatment of the Ag-specific CD4+ T cell clone P28D with soluble HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 results in a marked impairment of CD3/TCR-mediated responses. In this report, to further understand these inhibitory effects, the binding properties and internalization of gp120 have been investigated, in parallel with functional studies, in long term incubations of P28D cells with gp120. Immunofluorescence studies show that surface-bound gp120 level is maximal within 1 h of incubation at 37 degrees C and then gradually decreases. This decrease is accompanied by a progressive down-modulation of membrane CD4 (30-35% loss over a 18-h incubation period) without concomitant alteration of the CD4 mRNA steady-state level. Similar experiments performed with 125I-labeled gp120 demonstrate that the glycoprotein is progressively internalized (up to 35% internalized material after 18 h) and that it accumulates inside the cells. Confocal microscopy studies show that internalized gp120 is concentrated in localized intracellular compartments. CD4 also accumulates in compartments with a similar localization and is stained with mAb OKT4 but not with mAb OKT4a. Concomitantly to internalization of gp120 and disappearance of membrane CD4, a correlated loss of the CD4-associated tyrosine kinase p56lck is evidenced. Interestingly, a progressive impairment of the P28D responses to specific Ag or to anti-CD3 mAb is also observed. Inhibitions of T cell proliferation increase with the degree of both CD4 and p56lck down-modulation. Removal of exogenous gp120 results in a rapid and spontaneous release of internalized gp120 into a degraded form. A progressive restoration of CD4 and p56lck levels is also noticed. In parallel, CD3/TCR-mediated responses of clone P28D are fully recovered. Altogether, our results suggest that HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120 is able to down-modulate membrane CD4 presumably by a cointernalization process and to further down-modulate the associated p56lck. This dual phenomenon is presumably involved in the direct immunosuppressive effect of gp120 on the CD3/TCR-mediated activation pathway."
15285794,Antioxidant protection from HIV-1 gp120-induced neuroglial toxicity.,"BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 (gp120) associated neuroglial toxicity remains unresolved, but oxidative injury has been widely implicated as a contributing factor. In previous studies, exposure of primary human central nervous system tissue cultures to gp120 led to a simplification of neuronal dendritic elements as well as astrocytic hypertrophy and hyperplasia; neuropathological features of HIV-1-associated dementia. Gp120 and proinflammatory cytokines upregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), an important source of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrosative stress. Because ascorbate scavenges reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, we studied the effect of ascorbate supplementation on iNOS expression as well as the neuronal and glial structural changes associated with gp120 exposure. METHODS: Human CNS cultures were derived from 16-18 week gestation post-mortem fetal brain. Cultures were incubated with 400 microM ascorbate-2-O-phosphate (Asc-p) or vehicle for 18 hours then exposed to 1 nM gp120 for 24 hours. The expression of iNOS and neuronal (MAP2) and astrocytic (GFAP) structural proteins was examined by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). RESULTS: Following gp120 exposure iNOS was markedly upregulated from undetectable levels at baseline. Double label CSLM studies revealed astrocytes to be the prime source of iNOS with rare neurons expressing iNOS. This upregulation was attenuated by the preincubation with Asc-p, which raised the intracellular concentration of ascorbate. Astrocytic hypertrophy and neuronal injury caused by gp120 were also prevented by preincubation with ascorbate. CONCLUSIONS: Ascorbate supplementation prevents the deleterious upregulation of iNOS and associated neuronal and astrocytic protein expression and structural changes caused by gp120 in human brain cell cultures."
8822372,Prevention of HIV-1 gp120-induced neuronal damage in the central nervous system of transgenic mice by the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine.,"To investigate the in vivo role of NMDA receptor stimulation in HIV-1-related CNS neurotoxicity, we evaluated the neuroprotective potential of the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine in transgenic mice which have gp120-induced CNS damage. Brains of mice treated chronically with memantine and of untreated controls were analysed for structural damage by laser scanning confocal microscopy of sections immunolabeled for microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) and synaptophysin. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of confocal images revealed that memantine treatment substantially decreased neuropathology in gp120 transgenic mice; this included statistically significant improvements in both dendritic and presynaptic terminal density. These results provide in vivo evidence that gp120 can activate neurotoxic pathways that can ultimately result in aberrant NMDA receptor stimulation and neuronal damage in the CNS. They also suggest that clinically tolerated NMDA receptor antagonists may be useful in the prevention of neuronal damage in HIV-1-infected patients."
15285795,Human CNS cultures exposed to HIV-1 gp120 reproduce dendritic injuries of HIV-1-associated dementia.,"HIV-1-associated dementia remains a common subacute to chronic central nervous system degeneration in adult and pediatric HIV-1 infected populations. A number of viral and host factors have been implicated including the HIV-1 120 kDa envelope glycoprotein (gp120). In human post-mortem studies using confocal scanning laser microscopy for microtubule-associated protein 2 and synaptophysin, neuronal dendritic pathology correlated with dementia. In the present study, primary human CNS cultures exposed to HIV-1 gp120 at 4 weeks in vitro suffered gliosis and dendritic damage analogous to that described in association with HIV-1-associated dementia."
22190034,Global landscape of HIV-human protein complexes.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has a small genome and therefore relies heavily on the host cellular machinery to replicate. Identifying which host proteins and complexes come into physical contact with the viral proteins is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how HIV rewires the host's cellular machinery during the course of infection. Here we report the use of affinity tagging and purification mass spectrometry to determine systematically the physical interactions of all 18 HIV-1 proteins and polyproteins with host proteins in two different human cell lines (HEK293 and Jurkat). Using a quantitative scoring system that we call MiST, we identified with high confidence 497 HIV-human protein-protein interactions involving 435 individual human proteins, with ∼40% of the interactions being identified in both cell types. We found that the host proteins hijacked by HIV, especially those found interacting in both cell types, are highly conserved across primates. We uncovered a number of host complexes targeted by viral proteins, including the finding that HIV protease cleaves eIF3d, a subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3. This host protein is one of eleven identified in this analysis that act to inhibit HIV replication. This data set facilitates a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of how the host machinery is manipulated during the course of HIV infection."
15888436,Inhibition of cellular HIV-1 protease activity by lysyl-tRNA synthetase.,"During early assembly of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), an assembly complex is formed, the components of which include genomic RNA, Gag, GagPol, tRNA(Lys), and lysyl tRNA synthetase (LysRS). Directly increasing or decreasing cellular expression of LysRS results in corresponding changes in viral infectivity and in the viral concentrations of LysRS, tRNA(Lys), and, surprisingly, reverse transcriptase (RT). Since altering the cellular expression of LysRS does not lead to a change in the incorporation of the RT precursor protein, GagPol, in protease-negative HIV-1, we propose that the altered viral content of RT resulting from alterations in cellular LysRS concentration results from the ability of LysRS to inhibit premature activation of Gag-Pol viral protease within the complex. Supporting this hypothesis, we find that increases and decreases in cellular LysRS expression are accompanied by 5-8-fold increases and 5-fold decreases, respectively, in the cytoplasmic proteolysis of Gag and GagPol to mature viral proteins. Using a novel bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay to directly measure HIV-1 protease activity in vivo also indicates that the overexpression of LysRS in the cell reduces viral protease activity."
15024055,Identification of Staufen in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag ribonucleoprotein complex and a role in generating infectious viral particles.,"Staufen is a host protein that is selectively incorporated into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles in a poorly defined process that involves the selection of HIV-1 genomic RNA for encapsidation and the activity of its third double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD3). To better understand this, we characterized its interactions with pr55(Gag), the principal mediator of HIV-1 genomic RNA encapsidation. Chimeric proviruses harboring wild-type or mutant forms of Staufen were expressed in 293T cells. Cell fractionation analyses demonstrated that Staufen cosedimented with pr55(Gag) within detergent-resistant, trypsin-sensitive complexes that excluded mature capsid and matrix proteins. Coimmunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays demonstrated a specific and direct interaction between Staufen and the nucleocapsid domain of pr55(Gag) in vitro and in live cells. This interaction is shown here to be mediated by Staufen's dsRBD3, with a contribution from its C-terminal domain. Immunoprecipitation and reverse transcription-PCR analyses showed that the 9-kb genomic RNA was found within Staufen-containing immune complexes. Spliced HIV-1 RNAs were not detected in these Staufen complexes, indicating a preferential association of Staufen with the 9-kb species. These results substantiate that Staufen and pr55(Gag) interact directly during HIV-1 expression. Knockdown of Staufen expression by small interfering RNAs in HIV-1-expressing cells demonstrated that this cellular protein was important for the generation of infectious virus. These data show that Staufen, pr55(Gag), and genomic RNA are part of the same intracellular complex and support a role for Staufen in pr55(Gag) function in viral assembly, genomic RNA encapsidation, and the generation of infectious viral particles."
11739697,Envelope glycoprotein cytoplasmic domains from diverse lentiviruses interact with the prenylated Rab acceptor.,"Lentivirus envelope glycoproteins have unusually long cytoplasmic domains compared to those of other retroviruses. To identify cellular binding partners of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope transmembrane protein (gp41) cytoplasmic domain (CD), we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a phytohemagglutinin-activated human T-cell cDNA library with the SIV gp41 CD. The majority of positive clones (50 of 54) encoded the prenylated Rab acceptor (PRA1). PRA1 is a 21-kDa protein associated with Golgi membranes that binds to prenylated Rab proteins in their GTP-bound state. While the cellular function of PRA1 is presently unknown, this protein appears to participate in intracellular vesicular trafficking, based on its cellular localization and ability to bind multiple members of the Rab protein family. Mammalian two-hybrid assays confirmed the interaction between the SIV gp41 CD and PRA1. Furthermore, gp41 sequences important for PRA1 binding were mapped to a central leucine-rich, amphipathic alpha-helix in the SIV gp41 cytoplasmic tail. Although the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) gp41 CD failed to interact with PRA1 in the yeast two-hybrid system, its interaction with PRA1 was significantly better than that of the SIV gp41 CD in mammalian two-hybrid assays. Interestingly, PRA1 also interacted with the Env CDs of HIV-2, bovine immunodeficiency virus, equine infectious anemia virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus. Thus, PRA1 associates with envelope glycoproteins from widely divergent lentiviruses."
15280532,Total chemical synthesis of N-myristoylated HIV-1 matrix protein p17: structural and mechanistic implications of p17 myristoylation.,"The HIV-1 matrix protein p17, excised proteolytically from the N terminus of the Gag polyprotein, forms a protective shell attached to the inner surface of the plasma membrane of the virus. During the late stages of the HIV-1 replication cycle, the N-terminally myristoylated p17 domain targets the Gag polyprotein to the host-cell membrane for particle assembly. In the early stages of HIV-1 replication, however, some p17 molecules dissociate from the viral membrane to direct the preintegration complex to the host-cell nucleus. These two opposing targeting functions of p17 require that the protein be capable of reversible membrane interaction. It is postulated that a significant structural change in p17 triggered by proteolytic cleavage of the Gag polyprotein sequesters the N-terminal myristoyl group, resulting in a weaker membrane binding by the matrix protein than the Gag precursor. To test this ""myristoyl switch"" hypothesis, we obtained highly purified synthetic HIV-1 p17 of 131 amino acid residues and its N-myristoylated form in large quantity. Both forms of p17 were characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy, protein chemical denaturation, and analytical centrifugal sedimentation. Our results indicate that although N-myristoylation causes no spectroscopically discernible conformational change in p17, it stabilizes the protein by 1 kcal/mol and promotes protein trimerization in solution. These findings support the premise that the myristoyl switch in p17 is triggered not by a structural change associated with proteolysis, but rather by the destabilization of oligomeric structures of membrane-bound p17 in the absence of downstream Gag subdomains."
8312056,The amino-terminal peptide of HIV-1 gp41 interacts with human serum albumin.,"Structural and functional studies were made to assess interactions between human serum albumin (HSA) and the amino-terminal peptide (FP-I; 23-residue peptide 519-541) of glycoprotein 41,000 (gp41) of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy indicated that the peptide binds to albumin with dominant alpha-helical character. Peptide binding to albumin was also examined using FP-I spin labeled at either the amino-terminal alanine (FP-II; residue 519) or methionine (FP-III; position 537). Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of FP-II bound to HSA at 38 degrees C indicated that the spin label at the amino-terminal residue (Ala-519) was motionally restricted. The ESR spectrum of 12-nitroxide stearate (12-NS)-labeled HSA was identical to that obtained with FP-II, indicating that the reporter groups for the 12-NS and FP-II probes are similarly bound to albumin. Contrarily, ESR spectra of HSA labeled with FP-III indicated high mobility for the reporter group (Met-537) at the aqueous-protein interface. This suggests that the N-terminal gp41 peptide binds as an alpha helix (residues 519-536) to fatty acid sites on HSA, such that Ala-519 of the peptide residues in the interior of the protein while Met-537 lies outside the protein in aqueous solution. It is also of interest that addition of HSA to human red blood cells dramatically reduced the ability of FP-I to induce hemolysis, presumably through peptide-albumin binding that inhibited FP-I interactions with red cell membranes. The significance of these results focuses on the following three points. The first is that high serum levels of albumin may limit the efficacy of anti-HIV therapies using peptides based on the N-terminal gp41 domain. The second is that the elucidation of FP-I and HSA interactions with physical techniques may provide clues on the molecular features underlying viral FP-I combination with receptors on the target cell surface. Last, the affinity of albumin for the N-terminal gp41 peptide may play a subordinate role in the blocking of HIV infectivity in vitro that has been reported for chemically modified albumins."
15914857,"PRA1 co-localizes with envelope but does not influence primate lentivirus production, infectivity or envelope incorporation.","The results of yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays previously indicated complex formation between prenylated Rab acceptor 1 (PRA1) and the cytoplasmic domain of gp41 (gp41CD) for both the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses [Evans, D. T., Tilman, K. C. & Desrosiers, R. C. (2002). J Virol 76, 327-337]. The assembly and release of infectious virus particles was studied under conditions of PRA1 overexpression in a transient transfection assay or suppression by RNA interference. Although a clear pattern of co-localization of PRA1 and gp41 was observed, no changes in virion release, infectivity or envelope content were observed as a result of either PRA1 suppression or overexpression. These data show that PRA1 co-localizes with gp41 inside cells and they are consistent with a direct or indirect interaction between these proteins. However, variation in the levels of PRA1 expression did not influence virion production, infectivity or envelope incorporation under the conditions of these assays."
15613319,Covalent modification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 p6 by SUMO-1.,"The p6 domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag polyprotein mediates virion budding from infected cells via protein-protein contacts with the class E vacuolar protein sorting factors, Tsg101 and AIP1/ALIX. Interaction with Tsg101 is strengthened by covalent attachment of monovalent ubiquitin to HIV-1 p6. To identify additional host factors that bind to HIV-1 p6, a human cDNA library was screened in the yeast two-hybrid system. HIV-1 p6 was found to interact with small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1) as well as the E2 SUMO-1 transfer enzyme, Ubc9. Interaction with p6 was also detected with Daxx, a cellular protein to which SUMO-1 is sometimes covalently attached. SUMO-1 was incorporated into HIV-1 virions where it was protected within the virion membrane from digestion by exogenous protease. Of the two lysine residues in p6, lysine 27 uniquely served as a site of covalent SUMO-1 attachment. As previously reported, though, HIV-1 bearing the p6-K27R mutation replicated just like the wild type. Overproduction of SUMO-1 in HIV-1 producer cells had no apparent effect on virion release or on virion protein or RNA content. Infectivity of the resulting virions, though, was decreased, with the defect occurring after membrane fusion, at the time of viral cDNA synthesis. HIV-1 bearing the p6-K27R mutation was insensitive to SUMO-1 overexpression, suggesting that covalent attachment of SUMO-1 to p6 is detrimental to HIV-1 replication."
9448295,Structure-function analysis of integrase interactor 1/hSNF5L1 reveals differential properties of two repeat motifs present in the highly conserved region.,"Retroviral integrase (IN) catalyzes the integration of retroviral cDNA into host chromosome. Ini1 (integrase interactor 1) is a host protein that specifically binds and stimulates in vitro joining activity of HIV-1 IN. Ini1 has homology to yeast transcription factor SNF5 and is a component of the analogous mammalian SWI/SNF complex that can remodel chromatin. Little is known about the function of Ini1 in mammalian cells. To gain insight into the functional domains of Ini1, and to understand the details of protein-protein interactions of IN and Ini1, a structure-function analysis of Ini1 was initiated. By means of the yeast two-hybrid system, the minimal IN binding domain of Ini1 was characterized. One of the two repeat motifs present in the highly conserved regions of Ini1 was found necessary and sufficient to bind to IN in yeast as well as in vitro. Because IN binds to only one of the two repeat motifs in this conserved region of Ini1, it appears that the IN-Ini1 interaction is very specific and functionally significant. Characterization of DNA-binding properties of Ini1 revealed that Ini1 can bind to plasmid DNA, binding more readily to supercoiled DNA than to the relaxed circular DNA. The minimal domain for DNA binding was localized to a region upstream of repeat 1. The DNA binding activity of Ini1 is not required for its ability to interact with IN. The finding that the two repeat motifs of Ini1 display differential binding to HIV-1 IN and that this discrete component of mammalian SWI/SNF complex binds to DNA will help understand the role of Ini1 in HIV-1 integration and in cellular process."
15567440,A DEAD box protein facilitates HIV-1 replication as a cellular co-factor of Rev.,"HIV-1 Rev escorts unspliced viral mRNAs out of the nucleus of infected cells, which allows formation of infectious HIV-1 virions. We have identified a putative DEAD box (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) RNA helicase, DDX1, as a cellular co-factor of Rev, through yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems using the N-terminal motif of Rev as ""bait"". DDX1 is not a functional homolog of HIV-1 Rev, but down-regulation of DDX1 resulted in an alternative splicing pattern of Rev-responsive element (RRE)-containing mRNA, and attenuation of Gag p24 antigen production from HLfb rev- cells rescued by exogenous Rev. Co-transfection of a DDX1 expression vector with HIV-1 significantly increased viral production. DDX1 binding to Rev, as well as to the RRE, strongly suggest that DDX1 affects Rev function through the Rev-RRE axis. Moreover, down-regulation of DDX1 altered the steady state subcellular distribution of Rev, from nuclear/nucleolar to cytoplasmic dominance. These findings indicate that DDX1 is a critical cellular co-factor for Rev function, which maintains the proper subcellular distribution of this lentiviral regulatory protein. Therefore, alterations in DDX1-Rev interactions could induce HIV-1 persistence and targeting DDX1 may lead to rationally designed and novel anti-HIV-1 strategies and therapeutics."
9636371,"HHR23A, the human homologue of the yeast repair protein RAD23, interacts specifically with Vpr protein and prevents cell cycle arrest but not the transcriptional effects of Vpr.","Yeast two-hybrid selection of proteins interacting with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr identified HHR23A, a human homologue of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23, as a specific interactor. A small 57-amino-acid C-terminal portion of HHR23A was sufficient for Vpr interaction. When introduced into human cells by transfection, full-length HHR23A or its C-terminal fragments were able to alleviate Vpr-induced cell cycle arrest, suggesting that HHR23A may participate in the pathway leading to G2 arrest by Vpr. We have also examined the effects of HHR23 on the recently identified transcription coactivator function of Vpr. The two Vpr functions are independent, since we have identified mutants lacking either the cell cycle arrest or the coactivator function. Our analysis showed that excess of HHR23A does not affect the coactivator function of Vpr, while it affects the cell cycle arresting function. Therefore, a simple sequestering model for Vpr in the presence of excess HHR23A is not supported. We propose that the interaction of HHR23A with Vpr may affect specifically pathways leading to cell cycle regulation."
9525626,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral protein R (Vpr) interacts with Lys-tRNA synthetase: implications for priming of HIV-1 reverse transcription.,"The vpr gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a 96-amino-acid 14-kDa protein (viral protein R [Vpr]), which is produced late in the viral life cycle and is incorporated into the virion. Although Vpr is not required for viral replication in transformed cell lines and primary T lymphocytes, it is essential for productive infection of macrophages and monocytes and appears to be important for pathogenesis in vivo. To establish the role of Vpr in HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis, we have isolated cellular proteins with which Vpr interacts. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, Lys-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) was identified as a Vpr-interacting protein. The interaction between Vpr and LysRS was characterized both in vitro and in vivo, and the domains of Vpr required for the interaction were defined. In the presence of Vpr, LysRS-mediated amino-acylation of tRNA(Lys) is inhibited. Since tRNA(Lys) is the primer for reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome, this suggests that the interaction between Vpr and LysRS may influence the initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription."
15218037,The human endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-I) and its role in HIV-1 budding.,"Efficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) budding requires an interaction between the PTAP late domain in the viral p6(Gag) protein and the cellular protein TSG101. In yeast, Vps23p/TSG101 binds both Vps28p and Vps37p to form the soluble ESCRT-I complex, which functions in sorting ubiquitylated protein cargoes into multivesicular bodies. Human cells also contain ESCRT-I, but the VPS37 component(s) have not been identified. Bioinformatics and yeast two-hybrid screening methods were therefore used to identify four novel human proteins (VPS37A-D) that share weak but significant sequence similarity with yeast Vps37p and to demonstrate that VPS37A and VPS37B bind TSG101. Detailed studies produced four lines of evidence that human VPS37B is a Vps37p ortholog. 1) TSG101 bound to several different sites on VPS37B, including a putative coiled-coil region and a PTAP motif. 2) TSG101 and VPS28 co-immunoprecipitated with VPS37B-FLAG, and the three proteins comigrated together in soluble complexes of the correct size for human ESCRT-I ( approximately 350 kDa). 3) Like TGS101, VPS37B became trapped on aberrant endosomal compartments in the presence of VPS4A proteins lacking ATPase activity. 4) Finally, VPS37B could recruit TSG101/ESCRT-I activity and thereby rescue the budding of both mutant Gag particles and HIV-1 viruses lacking native late domains. Further studies of ESCRT-I revealed that TSG101 mutations that inhibited PTAP or VPS28 binding blocked HIV-1 budding. Taken together, these experiments define new components of the human ESCRT-I complex and characterize several TSG101 protein/protein interactions required for HIV-1 budding and infectivity."
15331737,Rotavirus enterotoxin NSP4 binds to the extracellular matrix proteins laminin-beta3 and fibronectin.,"Rotavirus is the most important cause of viral gastroenteritis and dehydrating diarrhea in young children. Rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) is an enterotoxin that was identified as an important agent in symptomatic rotavirus infection. To identify cellular proteins that interact with NSP4, a two-hybrid technique with Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used. NSP4 cDNA, derived from the human rotavirus strain Wa, was cloned into the yeast shuttle vector pGBKT7. An intestinal cDNA library derived from Caco-2 cells cloned into the yeast shuttle vector pGAD10 was screened for proteins that interact with NSP4. Protein interactions were confirmed in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical colocalization. After two-hybrid library screening, we repeatedly isolated cDNAs encoding the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein laminin-beta3 (amino acids [aa] 274 to 878) and a cDNA encoding the ECM protein fibronectin (aa 1755 to 1884). Using deletion mutants of NSP4, we mapped the region of interaction with the ECM proteins between aa 87 and 145. Deletion analysis of laminin-beta3 indicated that the region comprising aa 726 to 875 of laminin-beta3 interacts with NSP4. Interaction of NSP4 with either laminin-beta3 or fibronectin was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. NSP4 was present in infected enterocytes and in the basement membrane (BM) of infected neonatal mice and colocalized with laminin-beta3, indicating a physiological interaction. In conclusion, two-hybrid screening with NSP4 yielded two potential target proteins, laminin-beta3 and fibronectin, interacting with the enterotoxin NSP4. The release of NSP4 from the basal side of infected epithelial cells and the subsequent binding to ECM proteins localized at the BM may signify a new mechanism by which rotavirus disease is established."
11907324,Hantavirus nucleocapsid protein interacts with the Fas-mediated apoptosis enhancer Daxx.,"Hantaviruses cause two severe diseases, haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Eurasia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the Americas. To understand more about the molecular mechanisms that lead to these diseases, the associations of Puumala virus nucleocapsid protein (PUUV-N) with cellular proteins were studied by yeast two-hybrid screening. Daxx, known as an apoptosis enhancer, was identified from a HeLa cDNA library and its interaction with PUUV-N was confirmed by GST pull-down assay, co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies. Furthermore, domains of interaction were mapped to the carboxyl-terminal region of 142 amino acids in Daxx and the carboxyl-terminal 57 residues in PUUV-N, respectively. In pepscan assays, the binding sites of Daxx to PUUV-N were mapped further to two lysine-rich regions, of which one overlaps the sequence of the predicted nuclear localization signal of Daxx. These data suggest a direct link between host cell machinery and a hantavirus structural component."
11024152,Cytoplasmic dynein LC8 interacts with lyssavirus phosphoprotein.,"Using a yeast two-hybrid human brain cDNA library screen, the cytoplasmic dynein light chain (LC8), a 10-kDa protein, was found to interact strongly with the phosphoprotein (P) of two lyssaviruses: rabies virus (genotype 1) and Mokola virus (genotype 3). The high degree of sequence divergence between these P proteins (only 46% amino acid identity) favors the hypothesis that this interaction is a common property shared by all lyssaviruses. The P protein-dynein LC8 interaction was confirmed by colocalization with laser confocal microscopy in infected cells and by coimmunoprecipitation. The dynein-interacting P protein domain was mapped to the 186 amino acid residues of the N-terminal half of the protein. Dynein LC8 is a component of both cytoplasmic dynein and myosin V, which are involved in a wide range of intracellular motile events, such as microtubule minus-end directed organelle transport in axon ""retrograde transport"" and actin-based vesicle transport, respectively. Our results provide support for a model of viral nucleocapsid axoplasmic transport. Furthermore, the role of LC8 in cellular mechanisms other than transport, e.g., inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, suggests that the P protein interactions could be involved in physiopathological mechanisms of rabies virus-induced pathogenesis."
12800254,Identification of RanBMP interacting with Shigella flexneri IpaC invasin by two-hybrid system of yeast.,"Bacillary dysentery caused by Shigella flexneri is still a threat to human health. Of four invasion plasmid antigen proteins (IpaA,B,C and D), IpaC plays an important role in the pathogenicity of this pathogen. The purpose of this study was to investigate the proteins interacting with IpaC in the host cell during the pathogenic process of this disease."
17003132,Tail-interacting protein TIP47 is a connector between Gag and Env and is required for Env incorporation into HIV-1 virions.,"The presence of the envelope glycoprotein Env in HIV-1 virions is essential for infectivity. To date, the molecular mechanism by which Env is packaged into virions has been largely unknown. Here, we show that TIP47 (tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa), which has been shown to interact with Env, also binds the MA (matrix) domain of HIV-1 Gag protein and that these three proteins form a ternary complex. Mutations in Gag that abrogate interaction with TIP47 inhibit Env incorporation and virion infectivity as well as colocalization between Gag and Env. We also show that TIP47 silencing impairs Env incorporation and infectivity and abolishes coimmunoprecipitation of Gag with Env. In contrast, overexpression of TIP47 increases Env packaging. Last, we demonstrate that TIP47 can interact simultaneously with Env and Gag. Taken together, our results show that TIP47 is a cellular cofactor that plays an essential role in Env incorporation, allowing the encounter and the physical association between HIV-1 Gag and Env proteins during the viral assembly process."
12663813,The barrier-to-autointegration factor is a component of functional human immunodeficiency virus type 1 preintegration complexes.,"Retroviral integration in vivo is mediated by preintegration complexes (PICs) derived from infectious virions. In addition to the integrase enzyme and cDNA substrate, PICs contain a variety of viral and host cell proteins. Whereas two different cell proteins, high-mobility group protein A1 (HMGA1) and the barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), were identified as integration cofactors based on activities in in vitro PIC assays, only HMGA1 was previously identified as a PIC component. By using antibodies against known viral and cellular PIC components, we demonstrate here functional coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous BAF protein with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) PICs. Since integrase protein and integration activity were also coimmunoprecipitated by anti-BAF antibodies, we conclude that BAF is a component of HIV-1 PICs. These data are consistent with the model that BAF functions as an integration cofactor in vivo."
11069991,Retroviral cDNA integration: stimulation by HMG I family proteins.,"To replicate, a retrovirus must synthesize a cDNA copy of the viral RNA genome and integrate that cDNA into a chromosome of the host. We have investigated the role of a host cell cofactor, HMG I(Y) protein, in integration of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) cDNA. Previously we reported that HMG I(Y) cofractionates with HIV-1 preintegration complexes (PICs) isolated from freshly infected cells. PICs depleted of required components by treatment with high concentrations of salt could be reconstituted by addition of purified HMG I(Y) in vitro. Here we report studies using immunoprecipitation that indicate that HMG I(Y) is associated with MoMLV preintegration complexes. In mechanistic studies, we show for both HIV-1 and MoMLV that each HMG I(Y) monomer must contain multiple DNA binding domains to stimulate integration by HMG I(Y)-depleted PICs. We also find that HMG I(Y) can condense model HIV-1 or MoMLV cDNA in vitro as measured by stimulation of intermolecular ligation. This reaction, like reconstitution of integration, depends on the presence of multiple DNA binding domains in each HMG I(Y) monomer. These data suggest that binding of multivalent HMG I(Y) monomers to multiple cDNA sites compacts retroviral cDNA, thereby promoting formation of active integrase-cDNA complexes."
12016221,Interaction of HIV-1 integrase with DNA repair protein hRad18.,"We have previously shown that human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) integrase is an unstable protein and a substrate for the N-end rule degradation pathway. This degradation pathway shares its ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Rad6, with the post-replication/translesion DNA repair pathway. Because DNA repair is thought to play an essential role in HIV-1 integration, we investigated whether other molecules of this DNA repair pathway could interact with integrase. We observed that co-expression of human Rad18 induced the accumulation of an otherwise unstable form of HIV-1 integrase. This accumulation occurred even though hRAD18 possesses a RING finger domain, a structure that is generally associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase function and protein degradation. Evidence for an interaction between integrase and hRad18 was obtained through reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. Moreover we found that a 162-residue region of hRad18 (amino acids 65-226) was sufficient for both integrase stabilization and interaction. Finally, we observed that HIV-1 integrase co-localized with hRad18 in nuclear structures in a subpopulation of co-transfected cells. Taken together, these findings identify hRad18 as a novel interacting partner of HIV-1 integrase and suggest a role for post-replication/translesion DNA repair in the retroviral integration process."
17121803,Silencing of both beta-TrCP1 and HOS (beta-TrCP2) is required to suppress human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu-mediated CD4 down-modulation.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu protein interacts with CD4 within the endoplasmic reticula of infected cells and targets CD4 for degradation through interaction with beta-TrCP1. Mammals possess a homologue of beta-TrCP1, HOS, which is also named beta-TrCP2. We show by coimmunoprecipitation experiments that beta-TrCP2 binds Vpu and is able to induce CD4 down-modulation as efficiently as beta-TrCP1. In two different cell lines, HeLa CD4+ and Jurkat, Vpu-mediated CD4 down-modulation could not be reversed through the individual silencing of endogenous beta-TrCP1 or beta-TrCP2 but instead required the two genes to be silenced simultaneously."
14530271,Protein profile of tax-associated complexes.,"Infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) results in adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. Tax, a 40-kDa protein, regulates viral and cellular transcription, host signal transduction, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Tax has been shown to modulate cellular CREB and NFkappaB pathways; however, to date, its role in binding to various host cellular proteins involved in tumorigenesis has not been fully described. In this study, we describe the Tax-associated proteins and their functions in cells using several approaches. Tax eluted from a sizing column mostly at an apparent molecular mass of 1800 kDa. Following Tax immunoprecipitation, washes with high salt buffer, two-dimensional gel separation, and mass spectrometric analysis, a total of 32 proteins was identified. Many of these proteins belong to the signal transduction and cytoskeleton pathways and transcription/chromatin remodeling. A few of these proteins, including TXBP151, have been shown previously to bind to Tax. The interaction of Tax with small GTPase-cytoskeleton proteins, such as ras GAP1m, Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA, and gelsolin, indicates how Tax may regulate migration, invasion, and adhesion in T-cell cancers. Finally, the physical and functional association of Tax with the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex was assessed using in vitro chromatin remodeling assays, chromatin remodeling factor BRG1 mutant cells, and RNA interference experiments. Collectively, Tax is able to bind and regulate many cellular proteins that regulate transcription and cytoskeletal related pathways, which might explain the pleiotropic effects of Tax leading to T-cell transformation and leukemia in HTLV-1-infected patients."
13679614,Association of Japanese encephalitis virus NS3 protein with microtubules and tumour susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) protein.,"Previously reported findings by our group showed that non-structural protein 3 (NS3) of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) was localized mainly in the JEV-induced convoluted membrane (CM), which has been proposed to originate from rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), Golgi apparatus or the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and serves as a reservoir for viral proteins during virus assembly. Earlier findings indicated that NS3 of Kunjin virus interacts with microtubules. In addition, one of the Golgi-associated proteins, tumour susceptibility protein 101 (TSG101), associates with microtubules and is required for budding of retroviral particles. To clarify the association of NS3 with microtubules or with TSG101 during JEV assembly, we applied immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation and immunoelectron microscopic methods. Virus infection, as well as transfection with an NS2B-NS3 expression plasmid, induced microtubule rearrangement. When cells were treated with colchicine, which interferes with microtubule polymerization, NS3 still associated with tubulin and TSG101. Furthermore, tubulin and TSG101 were co-localized with NS3 in the CM by immunogold labelling. Our observations indicate that microtubules and TSG101 associate with NS3, which is incorporated into the JEV-induced structure during JEV replication."
10074138,Interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nucleocapsid with actin.,"The nucleocapsid (NC) domain of the retrovirus Gag protein plays several important roles in the viral life cycle, including virus assembly, viral genomic RNA encapsidation, primer tRNA placement, and enhancement of viral reverse transcription. In this study, deletion of NC domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag was found to drastically reduce virus particle production in CD4(+) T cells. Cellular fractionation experiments showed that although most of the uncleaved wild-type HIV-1 Gag, unmyristylated Gag, and p6(Gag) domain-truncated Gag molecules copurified with the host cell cytoskeleton, most of the mutant Gag molecules lacking both the NC and p6(Gag) domains failed to cofractionate with cytoskeleton. In wild-type virus-infected cells, in which the viral protease was active, the cleaved NCp7 copurified with the cytoskeleton, whereas most of the MAp17 and CAp24 did not. Monoclonal antibody against actin coimmunoprecipitated full-length Gag and p6(Gag) domain-truncated Gag molecules from cell lysates but failed to precipitate the truncated mutant Gag molecules lacking NC plus p6(Gag). Purified recombinant NCp7, but not CAp24, was able to bind F-actin in cosedimentation experiments. Furthermore, wild-type NCp7 and a zinc finger mutant NCp7(F16A), like a cellular actin-binding protein (the villin headpiece), bound F-actin in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that HIV-1 NCp7 can bind F-actin directly and that interaction between HIV-1 Gag and the actin cytoskeleton through the NC domain may play an important role in HIV-1 assembly and/or other steps of the viral life cycle."
15155723,The host cell MAP kinase ERK-2 regulates viral assembly and release by phosphorylating the p6gag protein of HIV-1.,"The host cell MAP kinase ERK-2 incorporated within human immunodeficiency virus type 1 particles plays a critical role in virus infectivity by phosphorylating viral proteins. Recently, a fraction of the virus incorporated late (L) domain-containing p6(gag) protein, which has an essential function in the release of viral particles from the cell surface, was reported to be phosphorylated by an unknown virus-associated cellular protein kinase (Muller, B., Patschinsky, T., and Krausslich, H. G. (2002) J. Virol. 76, 1015-1024). The present study demonstrates the contribution of the MAP kinase ERK-2 in p6(gag) phosphorylation. According to mutational analysis, a single ERK-2-phosphorylated threonine residue, belonging to a highly conserved phosphorylation MAP kinase consensus site, was identified at position 23 within p6(gag). Substitution by an alanine of the Thr(23) phosphorylable residue within the pNL4.3 molecular clone was found to decrease viral release from various cell types. As observed from electron microscopy experiments, most virions produced from this molecular clone remained incompletely separated from the host cell membrane with an immature morphology and displayed a reduced infectivity in single round infection experiments. Analysis of protein processing by Western blotting experiments revealed an incomplete Pr55(gag) maturation and a reduction in the virion-associated reverse transcriptase proteins was observed that was not related to differences in intracellular viral protein expression. Altogether, these data suggest that phosphorylation of p6(gag) protein by virus-associated ERK-2 is involved in the budding stage of HIV-1 life cycle."
8424456,"Cleavage of human and mouse cytoskeletal and sarcomeric proteins by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease. Actin, desmin, myosin, and tropomyosin.","HeLa cell actin was cleaved by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease when in its soluble, globular form (G-actin). No cleavage of the polymerized, filamentous form of actin (F-actin) was observed when examined by denaturing gel electrophoresis; however, electron microscopy revealed a low level of cleavage of F-actin. Immunoblotting of mouse skeletal and human pectoral muscle myofibrils treated in vitro with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease showed that myosin heavy chain, desmin, tropomyosin, and a fraction of the actin were all cleaved. Electron microscopy of these myofibrils demonstrated changes consistent with cleavage of these proteins: Z-lines were rapidly lost, the length of the A bands was shortened, and the thick filaments (myosin filaments) were often laterally frayed such that the structures disintegrated. Nonmuscle myosin heavy chains were also cleaved by this enzyme in vitro. These data demonstrate that this protease can cause alterations in muscle cell ultrastructure in vitro that may be of clinical relevance in infected individuals."
2212989,Proteolytic cleavage of microtubule-associated proteins by retroviral proteinases.,"Aspartic proteinases from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) were found to interfere with microtubule assembly. Preincubation of the proteinases with purified brain microtubule proteins (tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins) at low ionic strength (pH 6.8), completely inhibited microtubule assembly. Analysis of microtubule proteins after incubation with proteinase showed no effect on tubulin but extensive cleavage of the microtubule-associated proteins 1 and 2 was observed. The digestion by the two proteinases differed. In the presence of HIV-1 proteinase, a fragment with an Mr of approximately 300, appeared, as well as at least three other new fragments, with Mr values of 188,000, 124,000 and 73,000. In the presence of AMV proteinase, the microtubule-associated proteins were extensively digested to many small fragments. The extending microtubule-associated proteins normally seen by electron microscopy on the microtubule surface disappeared after treatment with AMV proteinase. Our results show that retroviral proteinases are not restricted to cleavage of viral polyproteins in vitro. It is suggested that proteolysis of microtubular proteins by viral proteinases is an important step in viral pathogenicity and that it may be part of a mechanism causing degenerative effects in infected cells."
17182674,The C-terminal portion of the Hrs protein interacts with Tsg101 and interferes with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag particle production.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag protein recruits Tsg101 to facilitate HIV-1 particle budding and release. In uninfected cells, the Hrs protein recruits the ESCRT-I complex to the endosome, also through an interaction with Tsg101, to promote the sorting of host proteins into endosomal vesicles and multivesicular bodies. Here, we show that the overexpression of the C-terminal fragment of Hrs (residues 391 to 777) or Hrs mutants lacking either the N-terminal FYVE domain (mutant dFYVE) or the PSAP (residues 348 to 351) motif (mutant ASAA) all efficiently inhibit HIV-1 Gag particle production. Expression of the dFYVE or ASAA mutants of Hrs had no effect on the release of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that the expression of Hrs mutant dFYVE or ASAA significantly reduced or abolished the HIV-1 Gag-Tsg101 interaction. Yeast-two hybrid assays were used to identify two new and independent Tsg101 binding sites, one in the Hrs coiled-coil domain and one in the proline/glutamic acid-rich domain. Scanning electron microscopy of HeLa cells expressing HIV-1 Gag and the Hrs ASAA mutant showed viral particles arrested in ""lump-like"" structures that remained attached to the cell surface. Together, these data indicate that fragments of Hrs containing the C-terminal portion of the protein can potently inhibit HIV-1 particle release by efficiently sequestering Tsg101 away from the Gag polyprotein."
16682056,Assembly of infectious HIV-1 in human epithelial and T-lymphoblastic cell lines.,"The canonical view of the ultimate steps of HIV-1 replication is that virus assembly and budding are taking place at the plasma membrane of infected cells. Surprisingly, recent studies revealed that these steps also occur on endosomal membranes in the interior of infected cells, such as macrophages. This prompted us to revisit the site of HIV-1 assembly in human epithelial-like cells and in infected human T-lymphoblastic cells. To address this question, we investigated the intracellular location of the major viral structural components of HIV-1, namely Gag, Env and the genomic RNA. Using a sub-cellular fractionation method, as well as immuno-confocal and electron microscopy, we show that Gag, the Env glycoproteins and the genomic RNA accumulate in late endosomes that contain infectious HIV-1 particles. In epithelial-like 293T cells, HIV-1 assembles and buds both at the plasma membrane and in endosomes, while in chronically infected human T lymphocytes, viral assembly mostly occurs within the cell where large amounts of infectious virions accumulate in endosomal compartments. In addition, HIV-1 release could be enhanced by ionomycin, a drug stimulating calcium-dependent exocytosis. These results favour the view that newly made Gag molecules associate with the genomic RNA in the cytosol, then viral core complexes can be targeted to late endosomes together with Env, where infectious HIV-1 are made and subsequently released by exocytosis."
16183191,The effect of HIV-1 Gag myristoylation on membrane binding.,"During the viral life cycle, an HIV protein, Gag, assembles at the host membrane, specifically at lipid raft regions, at very high concentrations leading to viral particle budding. Gag is post-translationally modified with an N-terminal myristate group which is thought to target Gag to lipid rafts thus aiding in assembly. Here we have analyzed the membrane binding of myristoylated HIV-1 Gag and a non-myristoylated form of HIV-1 Gag to various membrane models. After assessing the extent of myristoylation by HPLC and radiometric assays, we compared membrane binding using fluorescence methods. We found that myristoylated Gag shows a greater than twofold increase in binding affinity to model rafts. A structural model to explain these results is presented."
16702215,In vitro characterization of the interaction between HIV-1 Gag and human lysyl-tRNA synthetase.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral assembly is mediated by multiple protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. Human tRNA(Lys3) is used as the primer for HIV reverse transcription, and HIV Gag and GagPol are required for packaging of the tRNA into virions. Human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) is also specifically packaged into HIV, suggesting a role for LysRS in tRNA packaging. Gag alone is sufficient for packaging of LysRS, and these two proteins have been shown to interact in vitro using glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. In vitro pull-down assays using truncated constructs have also revealed that residues important for homodimerization of Gag and LysRS are critical for the Gag/LysRS interaction. In this work, we report further in vitro characterization of the interaction between HIV Gag and human LysRS using affinity pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy measurements and gel chromatography. An equilibrium binding constant of 310 +/- 80 nM was measured for the Gag/LysRS interaction. We also show that capsid alone binds to LysRS with a similar affinity as full-length Gag. Point mutations that disrupt the homodimerization of LysRS and Gag in vitro do not affect their interaction. These results suggest that dimerization of each protein per se is not required for the interaction but that residues involved in forming the homodimer interfaces contribute to heterodimer formation. Gel chromatography studies further support the formation of a Gag/LysRS heterodimer."
10366569,Nuclear localization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase expressed as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein.,"Lentiviruses in general and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in particular have the ability to integrate their genome stably into the chromosome of nondividing cells. Integration of HIV cDNA is mediated by the viral integrase (IN). Apart from its catalytic activity, this enzyme seems to play an important role in the transport of the HIV preintegration complex into the nucleus of nondividing cells. We studied the karyophilic properties of IN by constructing an N-terminal fusion protein of HIV-1 integrase and green fluorescent protein (GFP-IN). Transient expression of GFP-IN in various mammalian cell lines was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. Although wild-type GFP was localized throughout the cell, GFP-IN was localized predominantly in the nucleus. Nuclear localization of GFP-IN was also obtained after transient transfection of the cells arrested in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. These results provide compelling evidence for the karyophilic properties of the HIV-1 integrase."
12414950,Reassessment of the roles of integrase and the central DNA flap in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nuclear import.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can infect nondividing cells productively because the nuclear import of viral nucleic acids occurs in the absence of cell division. A number of viral factors that are present in HIV-1 preintegration complexes (PICs) have been assigned functions in nuclear import, including an essential valine at position 165 in integrase (IN-V165) and the central polypurine tract (cPPT). In this article, we report a comparison of the replication and infection characteristics of viruses with disruptions in the cPPT and IN-V165. We found that viruses with cPPT mutations still replicated productively in both dividing and nondividing cells, while viruses with a mutation at IN-V165 did not. Direct observation of the subcellular localization of HIV-1 cDNAs by fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that cDNAs synthesized by both mutant viruses were readily detected in the nucleus. Thus, neither the cPPT nor the valine residue at position 165 of integrase is essential for the nuclear import of HIV-1 PICs."
16096645,Acetylation of HIV-1 integrase by p300 regulates viral integration.,"Integration of HIV-1 into the human genome, which is catalyzed by the viral protein integrase (IN), preferentially occurs near transcriptionally active genes. Here we show that p300, a cellular acetyltransferase that regulates chromatin conformation through the acetylation of histones, also acetylates IN and controls its activity. We have found that p300 directly binds IN both in vitro and in the cells, as also specifically demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique analysis. This interaction results in the acetylation of three specific lysines (K264, K266, K273) in the carboxy-terminus of IN, a region that is required for DNA binding. Acetylation increases IN affinity to DNA, and promotes the DNA strand transfer activity of the protein. In the context of the viral replication cycle, point mutations in the IN acetylation sites abolish virus replication by specifically impairing its integration capacity. This is the first demonstration that HIV-1 IN activity is specifically regulated by post-translational modification."
11040134,Expression and coreceptor function of APJ for primate immunodeficiency viruses.,"APJ is a seven transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor that functions as a coreceptor for some primate immunodeficiency virus strains. The in vivo significance of APJ coreceptor function remains to be elucidated, however, due to the lack of an antibody that can be used to assess APJ expression, and because of the absence of an antibody or ligand that can block APJ coreceptor activity. Therefore, we produced a specific monoclonal antibody (MAb 856) to APJ and found that it detected this receptor in FACS, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry studies. MAb 856 also recognized APJ by Western blot, enabling us to determine that APJ is N-glycosylated. Using this antibody, we correlated APJ expression with coreceptor activity and found that APJ had coreceptor function even at low levels of expression. However, we found that APJ could not be detected by FACS analysis on cell lines commonly used to propagate primate lentiviruses, nor was it expressed on human PBMC cultured under a variety of conditions. We also found that some viral envelope proteins could mediate fusion with APJ-positive, CD4-negative cells, provided that CD4 was added in trans. These findings indicate that in some situations APJ use could render primary cell types susceptible to virus infection, although we have not found any evidence that this occurs. Finally, the peptide ligand for APJ, apelin-13, efficiently blocked APJ coreceptor activity."
7745681,Functional and structural interactions between measles virus hemagglutinin and CD46.,"We analyzed the roles of the individual measles virus (MV) surface glycoproteins in mediating functional and structural interactions with human CD46, the primary MV receptor. On one cell population, recombinant vaccinia virus vectors were used to produce the MV hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. As fusion partner cells, various cell types were examined, without or with human CD46 (endogenous or recombinant vaccinia virus encoded). Fusion between the two cell populations was monitored by a quantitative reporter gene activation assay and by syncytium formation. MV glycoproteins promoted fusion with primate cells but not with nonprimate cells; recombinant CD46 rendered nonprimate cells competent for MV glycoprotein-mediated fusion. Markedly different fusion specificity was observed for another morbillivirus, canine distemper virus (CDV): recombinant CDV glycoproteins promoted fusion with primate and nonprimate cells independently of CD46. Fusion by the recombinant MV and CDV glycoproteins required coexpression of H plus F in either homologous or heterologous combinations. To assess the role of H versus F in determining the CD46 dependence of MV fusion, we examined the fusion specificities of cells producing heterologous glycoprotein combinations. The specificity of HMV plus FCDV paralleled that observed for the homologous MV glycoproteins: fusion occurred with primate cells but not with nonprimate cells unless they produced recombinant CD46. By contrast, the specificity of HCDV plus FMV paralleled that for the homologous CDV glycoproteins: fusion occurred with either primate or nonprimate cells with no dependence on CD46. Thus, for both MV and CDV, fusion specificity was determined by H. In particular, the results demonstrate a functional interaction between HMV and CD46. Flow cytometry and antibody coprecipitation studies provided a structural correlate to this functional interaction: CD46 formed a molecular complex with HMV but not with FMV or with either CDV glycoprotein. These results highlight the critical role of the H glycoprotein in determining MV specificity for CD46-positive cells."
14699046,Entropic switch regulates myristate exposure in the HIV-1 matrix protein.,"The myristoylated matrix protein (myr-MA) of HIV functions as a regulator of intracellular localization, targeting the Gag precursor polyprotein to lipid rafts in the plasma membrane during virus assembly and dissociating from the membrane during infectivity for nuclear targeting of the preintegration complex. Membrane release is triggered by proteolytic cleavage of Gag, and it has, until now, been believed that proteolysis induces a conformational change in myr-MA that sequesters the myristyl group. NMR studies reported here reveal that myr-MA adopts myr-exposed [myr(e)] and -sequestered [myr(s)] states, as anticipated. Unexpectedly, the tertiary structures of the protein in both states are very similar, with the sequestered myristyl group occupying a cavity that requires only minor conformational adjustments for insertion. In addition, myristate exposure is coupled with trimerization, with the myristyl group sequestered in the monomer and exposed in the trimer (K(assoc) = 2.5 +/- 0.6 x 10(8) M(-2)). The equilibrium constant is shifted approximately 20-fold toward the trimeric, myristate-exposed species in a Gag-like construct that includes the capsid domain, indicating that exposure is enhanced by Gag subdomains that promote self-association. Our findings indicate that the HIV-1 myristyl switch is regulated not by mechanically induced conformational changes, as observed for other myristyl switches, but instead by entropic modulation of a preexisting equilibrium."
16075307,Model of full-length HIV-1 integrase complexed with viral DNA as template for anti-HIV drug design.,"We report structural models of the full-length integrase enzyme (IN) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and its complex with viral and human DNA. These were developed by means of molecular modeling techniques using all available experimental evidence, including X-ray crystallographic and NMR structures of portions of the full-length protein. Special emphasis was placed on obtaining a model of the enzyme's active site with the viral DNA apposed to it, based on the hypothesis that such a model would allow structure-based design of inhibitors that retain activity in vivo. This was because bound DNA might be present in vivo after 3'-processing but before strand transfer. These structural models were used to study the potential binding modes of various diketo-acid HIV-1 IN inhibitors (many of them preferentially inhibiting strand transfer) for which no experimentally derived complexed structures are available. The results indicate that the diketo-acid IN inhibitors probably chelate the metal ion in the catalytic site and also prevent the exposure of the 3'-processed end of the viral DNA to human DNA."
9846873,Structure of a human DNA repair protein UBA domain that interacts with HIV-1 Vpr.,"The HIV-1 protein Vpr is critical for a number of viral functions including a unique ability to arrest T-cells at a G2/M checkpoint and induce subsequent apoptosis. It has been shown to interact specifically with the second UBA (ubiquitin associated) domain found in the DNA repair protein HHR23A, a highly evolutionarily conserved protein. This domain is a commonly occurring sequence motif in some members of the ubiquitination pathway, UV excision repair proteins, and certain protein kinases. The three dimensional structure of the UBA domain, determined by NMR spectroscopy, is presented. The protein domain forms a compact three-helix bundle. One side of the protein has a hydrophobic surface that is the most likely Vpr target site."
11087358,Biochemical and structural analysis of the interaction between the UBA(2) domain of the DNA repair protein HHR23A and HIV-1 Vpr.,"The DNA repair protein HHR23A is a highly conserved protein that functions in nucleotide excision repair. HHR23A contains two ubiquitin associated domains (UBA) that are conserved in a number of proteins with diverse functions involved in ubiquitination, UV excision repair, and signaling pathways via protein kinases. The cellular binding partners of UBA domains remain unclear; however, we previously found that the HHR23A UBA(2) domain interacts specifically with the HIV-1 Vpr protein. Analysis of the low resolution solution structure of HHR23A UBA(2) revealed a hydrophobic loop region of the UBA(2) domain that we predicted was the interface for protein/protein interactions. Here we present results of in vitro binding studies that demonstrate the requirement of this hydrophobic loop region for interaction with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) Vpr. A single point mutation of the Pro at residue 333 to a Glu totally abolishes the binding of HIV-1 Vpr to UBA(2). High resolution NMR structures of the binding deficient UBA(2) mutant P333E as well as of the wild-type UBA(2) domain were determined to compare the effect of this mutation on the structure. Small but significant differences are observed only locally at the site of the mutation. The biochemical and structural analysis confirms the function of the HHR23A UBA(2) GFP-loop as the protein/protein interacting domain."
9525900,Diversity of HIV-1 Vpr interactions involves usage of the WXXF motif of host cell proteins.,"Targeting protein or RNA moieties to specific cellular compartments may enhance their desired functions and specificities. Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) encodes proteins in addition to Gag, Pol, and Env that are packaged into virus particles. One such retroviral-incorporated protein is Vpr, which is present in all primate lentiviruses. Vpr has been implicated in different roles within the HIV-1 life cycle. In testing a new hypothesis in which viral proteins are utilized as docking sites to incorporate protein moieties into virions, we used the peptide phage display approach to search for Vpr-specific binding peptides. In the present studies, we demonstrate that most of the peptides that bind to Vpr have a common motif, WXXF. More importantly, we demonstrate that the WXXF motif of uracil DNA glycosylase is implicated in the interaction of uracil DNA glycosylase with Vpr intracellularly. Finally, a dimer of the WXXF motif was fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene, and it was demonstrated that the WXXF dimer-CAT fusion protein construct produces CAT activity within virions in the presence of Vpr as a docking protein. This study provides a novel potential strategy in the targeting of anti-viral agents to interfere with HIV-1 replication."
12504543,Antibody fragments selected by phage display against the nuclear localization signal of the HIV-1 Vpr protein inhibit nuclear import in permeabilized and intact cultured cells.,"The HIV-1 Vpr protein harbors a nuclear localization signal in its N-terminal domain. A peptide bearing this domain and which is designated VprN has been used as a target to screen a phage display single chain Fv (scFv) library. Here we report the isolation of anti-VprN scFv fragments from this library. The purified scFv fragments were able to bind the VprN peptide in an ELISA-based system and to inhibit VprN-mediated nuclear import in permeabilized as well as in intact microinjected cells. Furthermore, the anti-VprN scFv fragments recognized the full-length recombinant Vpr protein and inhibited its nuclear import. The same scFv fragments did not inhibit nuclear import mediated by the nuclear localization signal of the SV40 large T-antigen demonstrating a specific effect. The use of the described inhibitory anti-VprN scFv fragments to study nuclear import of viral karyophilic proteins and their therapeutic potential is discussed."
10841792,"Peptide and peptide mimetic inhibitors of antigen presentation by HLA-DR class II MHC molecules. Design, structure-activity relationships, and X-ray crystal structures.","Molecular features of ligand binding to MHC class II HLA-DR molecules have been elucidated through a combination of peptide structure-activity studies and structure-based drug design, resulting in analogues with nanomolar affinity in binding assays. Stabilization of lead compounds against cathepsin B cleavage by N-methylation of noncritical backbone NH groups or by dipeptide mimetic substitutions has generated analogues that compete effectively against protein antigens in cellular assays, resulting in inhibition of T-cell proliferation. Crystal structures of four ternary complexes of different peptide mimetics with the rheumatoid arthritis-linked MHC DRB10401 and the bacterial superantigen SEB have been obtained. Peptide-sugar hybrids have also been identified using a structure-based design approach in which the sugar residue replaces a dipeptide. These studies illustrate the complementary roles played by phage display library methods, peptide analogue SAR, peptide mimetics substitutions, and structure-based drug design in the discovery of inhibitors of antigen presentation by MHC class II HLA-DR molecules."
17020411,tRNAs promote nuclear import of HIV-1 intracellular reverse transcription complexes.,"Infection of non-dividing cells is a biological property of HIV-1 crucial for virus transmission and AIDS pathogenesis. This property depends on nuclear import of the intracellular reverse transcription and pre-integration complexes (RTCs/PICs). To identify cellular factors involved in nuclear import of HIV-1 RTCs, cytosolic extracts were fractionated by chromatography and import activity examined by the nuclear import assay. A near-homogeneous fraction was obtained, which was active in inducing nuclear import of purified and labeled RTCs. The active fraction contained tRNAs, mostly with defective 3' CCA ends. Such tRNAs promoted HIV-1 RTC nuclear import when synthesized in vitro. Active tRNAs were incorporated into and recovered from virus particles. Mutational analyses indicated that the anticodon loop mediated binding to the viral complex whereas the T-arm may interact with cellular factors involved in nuclear import. These tRNA species efficiently accumulated into the nucleus on their own in a energy- and temperature-dependent way. An HIV-1 mutant containing MLV gag did not incorporate tRNA species capable of inducing HIV-1 RTC nuclear import and failed to infect cell cycle-arrested cells. Here we provide evidence that at least some tRNA species can be imported into the nucleus of human cells and promote HIV-1 nuclear import."
1744579,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 activates the classical pathway of complement by direct C1 binding through specific sites in the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), in contrast to animal retroviruses such as murine leukemia virus, is not lysed by human complement. Nevertheless, HIV-1 activates complement via the classical pathway independent of antibody, and C3b deposition facilitates infection of complement receptor-bearing cells. Using gel exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-1000, purified virions were found to bind 125I-labeled C1q, but not 125I-labeled dimeric proenzyme C1s. Virions activated the C1 complex, reconstituted from C1q, proenzyme C1r, and 125I-labeled proenzyme C1s, to an extent comparable with that obtained with immunoglobulin G-ovalbumin immune complexes. To determine the activating viral component, recombinant viral proteins were used: in the solid phase, soluble gp41 (sgp41) (the outer membrane part of gp41, residues 539-684 of gp160) bound C1q, but not dimeric proenzyme C1s, while gp120 was ineffective. In the fluid phase, sgp41 activated the C1 complex in a dose- and time-dependent manner, more efficiently than aggregated Ig, but less efficiently than immune complexes. To localize the C1 activating site(s) in gp41, synthetic peptides (15-residue oligomers spanning amino acids 531-695 of gp160) were used. Peptides covering positions 591-605 and 601-620 and, to a lesser extent, positions 561-575, had both the ability to bind C1q and to induce C3 deposition. These data provide the first experimental evidence of a direct interaction between the C1 complex and HIV-1, and indicate that C1 binding and activation are mediated by specific sites in gp41."
10419831,Production of chemokines CTAPIII and NAP/2 by digestion of recombinant ubiquitin-CTAPIII with yeast ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase and human immunodeficiency virus protease.,"Recombinant yeast ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (YUH1), which has an N-terminal (His)(6) tag, and an autolysis-resistant mutant of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease (HIV-1 Pr) have been used as specific proteases to yield peptides from a ubiquitin conjugate. In the present example, connective tissue-activating peptide (CTAPIII) and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP/2) were generated by digestion of a ubiquitin-CTAPIII conjugate with YUH1 and HIV Pr, respectively, as indicated below: [see text] YUH1 cleaved at the peptide bond formed by the C-terminal Gly(76) of ubiquitin (Ub) and the N-terminal Asn(1) of the 85-residue peptide CTAPIII. The HIV-1 Pr cleaved between Tyr(15) and Ala(16), the N-terminal Ala of the 70-residue peptide NAP/2. Both enzymes produced authentic peptides from the Ub fusion protein, with a nearly 100% yield. The liberated CTAPIII and NAP/2 were separated from (His)(6)-Ub, the trace amounts of unreacted (His)(6)-Ub-CTAPIII, HIV-1 Pr, and the (His)(6)-YUH1 by passage over a nickel-chelate column; the final yield was about 10 mg of peptide/liter of cell culture. (His)(6)-YUH1, the HIV Pr mutant, and the (His)(6)-Ub-CTAPIII substrate were all expressed individually in Escherichia coli. (His)(6)-YUH1 and (His)(6)-Ub-CTAPIII were highly expressed in a soluble form, but about 75% of the total (His)(6)-YUH1 was also found in inclusion bodies. Both proteins from the soluble fractions were easily purified in a single step by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography with a yield of about 27 mg of (His)(6)-Ub-CTAPIII and 13.6 mg of (His)(6)-YUH1 protein/liter of cell culture. Chemotactic factor activity, as assessed by the neutrophil shape change assay, was observed for NAP/2, but not for CTAPIII. This strategy, which employs YUH1 and the HIV-1 Pr as tools for the highly selective cleavage of the chimeric substrate, should be applicable to the large-scale production of a variety of peptides."
9325327,Thioltransferase (glutaredoxin) is detected within HIV-1 and can regulate the activity of glutathionylated HIV-1 protease in vitro.,"Previous studies have suggested that the two conserved cysteines of the HIV-1 protease may be involved in regulating protease activity. Here, we examined diglutathionylated wild type protease (Cys-67-SSG, Cys-95-SSG) and the monoglutathionylated protease mutants (C67A, Cys-95-SSG and C95A, Cys-67-SSG) as potential substrates for thioltransferase (glutaredoxin). Time-dependent changes in the extent of deglutathionylation of each protein were assayed by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. Glutathione alone was not an effective reductant, whereas thioltransferase displayed differential catalysis toward the Cys-95-SSG and Cys-67-SSG sites. At low thioltransferase concentrations (5 nM), deglutathionylation occurred almost exclusively at Cys-95-SSG. With substantially more thioltransferase (100 nM) Cys-67-SSG was partially deglutathionylated but only at 20% of the rate of Cys-95-SSG reduction. Treatment of the diglutathionylated protease with thioltransferase not only restored protease activity but generated an enzyme preparation that had a 3- to 5-fold greater specific activity relative to the fully reduced form. Immunoblot analysis of HIV-1MN virus with an antibody to thioltransferase detected a band co-migrating with recombinant thioltransferase that persisted following subtilisin treatment, indicating the presence of thioltransferase within HIV-1. Our results implicate thioltransferase in the regulation and/or maintenance of protease activity in HIV-1 infected cells."
12689412,Salivary agglutinin inhibits HIV type 1 infectivity through interaction with viral glycoprotein 120.,"Salivary agglutinin (SAG) is a high molecular mass glycoprotein (340 kDa) that plays important roles in innate immunity. SAG has been found to specifically inhibit HIV-1 infectivity and to bind to virus through the envelope protein gp120. Although SAG binds to gp120 of the virus, the exact nature of this binding has not been characterized. Using surface plasmon resonance technology, we have found that SAG interacts with recombinant envelopes derived from diverse HIV-1 isolates with K(D) values ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-10) M, comparable to gp120-sCD4 binding. Furthermore, SAG binding to gp120 is Ca(2+) dependent. sCD4 prebound to gp120 failed to abrogate SAG binding, suggesting a distinct mechanism for SAG inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity. Inhibition by monoclonal antibodies specific for carbohydrates also implicates the involvement of carbohydrates in the interaction between SAG and gp120. These results argue that the anti-HIV-1 activity of SAG is due to carbohydrate-mediated binding to gp120. A demonstration that SAG is related to lung scavenger receptor, gp-340, further suggests the roles of SAG in preventing pathogen invasion at the entry portal and raises its potential as an anti-HIV-1 drug candidate."
12881522,Cyclophilin A interacts with HIV-1 Vpr and is required for its functional expression.,"Viral protein R (Vpr) of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) is the major virion-associated accessory protein that affects a number of biological functions in the retroviral life cycle, including promotion of the transport of the preintegration complex into the nucleus and the induction of G2 host cell cycle arrest. Our recent investigation of the conformational heterogeneity of the proline residues in the N terminus of Vpr suggested a functional interaction between Vpr and a host peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) that might regulate the cis/trans interconversion of the imidic bond within the conserved proline residues of Vpr in vivo. Using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, Far Western blot, and pulldown experiments a physical interaction of Vpr with the major host PPIase cyclophilin A (CypA) is now demonstrated. The interaction domain involves the N-terminal region of Vpr including an essential role for proline in position 35. The CypA inhibitor cyclosporin A and non-immunosuppressive PPIase inhibitors such as NIM811 and sanglifehrin A block expression of Vpr without affecting pre- or post-translational events such as transcription, intracellular transport, or virus incorporation of Vpr. Similarly to CypA inhibition, Vpr expression is also reduced in HIV-1 infected CypA-/- knock-out T cells. This study thus shows that in addition to the interaction between CypA and HIV-1 capsid occurring during early steps in virus replication, CypA is also important for the de novo synthesis of Vpr and that in the absence of CypA activity, the Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest is completely lost in HIV-1-infected T cells."
9586631,Two human T cell receptors bind in a similar diagonal mode to the HLA-A2/Tax peptide complex using different TCR amino acids.,"The three-dimensional structure of a human alphabeta T cell receptor (TCR), B7, bound to the HLA-A2 molecule/HTLV-1 Tax peptide complex was determined by x-ray crystallography. Although different from the A6 TCR, previously studied, in 16 of the 17 residues that contact HLA-A2/Tax, the B7 TCR binds in a similar diagonal manner, only slightly tipped and rotated, relative to the A6 TCR. The structure explains data from functional assays on the specificity differences between the B7 and A6 TCRs for agonist, partial agonist, and null peptides. The existence of a structurally similar diagonal binding mode for TCRs favors mechanisms based on the formation of geometrically defined supramolecular assemblies for initiating signaling."
11060013,"Structure of a covalently stabilized complex of a human alphabeta T-cell receptor, influenza HA peptide and MHC class II molecule, HLA-DR1.","An alphabeta T-cell receptor (alphabetaTCR)/hemagglutinin (HA) peptide/human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR1 complex was stabilized by flexibly linking the HA peptide with the human HA1.7 alphabetaTCR, to increase the local concentration of the interacting proteins once the peptide has been loaded onto the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. The structure of the complex, determined by X-ray crystallography, has a binding mode similar to that of the human B7 alphabetaTCR on a pMHCI molecule. Twelve of the 15 MHC residues contacted are at the same positions observed earlier in class I MHC/peptide/TCR complexes. One contact, to an MHC loop outside the peptide-binding site, is conserved and specific to pMHCII complexes. TCR gene usage in the response to HA/HLA-DR appears to conserve charged interactions between three lysines of the peptide and acidic residues on the TCR."
8316295,Three-dimensional structure of the human class II histocompatibility antigen HLA-DR1.,"The three-dimensional structure of the class II histocompatibility glycoprotein HLA-DR1 from human B-cell membranes has been determined by X-ray crystallography and is similar to that of class I HLA. Peptides are bound in an extended conformation that projects from both ends of an 'open-ended' antigen-binding groove. A prominent non-polar pocket into which an 'anchoring' peptide side chain fits is near one end of the binding groove. A dimer of the class II alpha beta heterodimers is seen in the crystal forms of HLA-DR1, suggesting class II HLA dimerization as a mechanism for initiating the cytoplasmic signalling events in T-cell activation."
1516138,Degradation of cytoskeletal proteins by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease.,"Triton X-100-extracted human skin fibroblasts were exposed to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease and analysed by 2D-gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescence microscopy. Vimentin, two of the tropomyosin isoforms, a protein with M(r) approximately 90,000 and a protein with M(r) approximately 200,000 were found to be degraded. Structurally, this was accompanied by the disintegration of the vimentin filament network and the disappearance of the microfilament network. In contrast to our in vivo observations (Höner et al., 1991), prominent stress fibers and chromatin structure seemed to be rather resistant to the action of this protease."
21067998,"Reactome: a database of reactions, pathways and biological processes.","Reactome (http://www.reactome.org) is a collaboration among groups at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York University School of Medicine and The European Bioinformatics Institute, to develop an open source curated bioinformatics database of human pathways and reactions. Recently, we developed a new web site with improved tools for pathway browsing and data analysis. The Pathway Browser is an Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)-based visualization system that supports zooming, scrolling and event highlighting. It exploits PSIQUIC web services to overlay our curated pathways with molecular interaction data from the Reactome Functional Interaction Network and external interaction databases such as IntAct, BioGRID, ChEMBL, iRefIndex, MINT and STRING. Our Pathway and Expression Analysis tools enable ID mapping, pathway assignment and overrepresentation analysis of user-supplied data sets. To support pathway annotation and analysis in other species, we continue to make orthology-based inferences of pathways in non-human species, applying Ensembl Compara to identify orthologs of curated human proteins in each of 20 other species. The resulting inferred pathway sets can be browsed and analyzed with our Species Comparison tool. Collaborations are also underway to create manually curated data sets on the Reactome framework for chicken, Drosophila and rice."
18667692,Poxvirus ankyrin repeat proteins are a unique class of F-box proteins that associate with cellular SCF1 ubiquitin ligase complexes.,"F-box proteins direct the degradation of an extensive range of proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Members of this large family of proteins are typically bipartite. They recruit specific substrates through a substrate-binding domain and, via the F-box, link these to core components of a major class of ubiquitin ligases (SCF1). F-box proteins thus determine the specificity of SCF1-mediated ubiquitination. F-box-like motifs were recently detected in poxvirus ankyrin repeat (ANK) proteins but clear compositional differences to typical F-box proteins raise questions regarding the classification and function of the motif. Here we show that all five ANK proteins of a representative poxvirus, Orf virus, interact in vivo with core components of the SCF1 ubiquitin ligase complex. Interaction is dependent on the poxviral F-box-like motif and the adaptor subunit of the complex (SKP1). The viral protein does not block enzymatic activity of the complex. These observations identify the poxviral motif as a functional F-box. They also identify a new class of F-box that in contrast to cellular counterparts is truncated, has an extreme C-terminal location and is paired with an ANK protein-binding domain. ANK proteins constitute the largest family of poxviral proteins but their function and the significance of their abundance have remained an enigma. We propose that poxviruses use these unique ANK/F-box proteins to dictate target specificity to SCF1 ubiquitin ligases and thereby exploit the cell's ubiquitin-proteasome machinery."
11805081,"CADD, a Chlamydia protein that interacts with death receptors.","We report here the identification of a bacterial protein capable of interacting with mammalian death receptors in vitro and in vivo. The protein is encoded in the genome of Chlamydia trachomatis and has homologues in other Chlamydia species. This protein, which we refer to as ""Chlamydia protein associating with death domains"" (CADD), induces apoptosis in a variety of mammalian cell lines when expressed by transient gene transfection. Apoptosis induction can be blocked by Caspase inhibitors, indicating that CADD triggers cell death by engaging the host apoptotic machinery. CADD interacts with death domains of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family receptors TNFR1, Fas, DR4, and DR5 but not with the respective downstream adaptors. In infected epithelial cells, CADD is expressed late in the infectious cycle of C. trachomatis and co-localizes with Fas in the proximity of the inclusion body. The results suggest a role for CADD modulating the apoptosis pathways of cells infected, revealing a new mechanism of host-pathogen interaction."
21471204,Neisseria meningitidis adhesin NadA targets beta1 integrins: functional similarity to Yersinia invasin.,"Meningococci are facultative-pathogenic bacteria endowed with a set of adhesins allowing colonization of the human upper respiratory tract, leading to fulminant meningitis and septicemia. The Neisseria adhesin NadA was identified in about 50% of N. meningitidis isolates and is closely related to the Yersinia adhesin YadA, the prototype of the oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin (Oca) family. NadA is known to be involved in cell adhesion, invasion, and induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Because of the enormous diversity of neisserial cell adhesins the analysis of the specific contribution of NadA in meningococcal host interactions is limited. Therefore, we used a non-invasive Y. enterocolitica mutant as carrier to study the role of NadA in host cell interaction. NadA was shown to be efficiently produced and localized in its oligomeric form on the bacterial surface of Y. enterocolitica. Additionally, NadA mediated a β1 integrin-dependent adherence with subsequent internalization of yersiniae by a β1 integrin-positive cell line. Using recombinant NadA(24-210) protein and human and murine β1 integrin-expressing cell lines we could demonstrate the role of the β1 integrin subunit as putative receptor for NadA. Subsequent inhibition assays revealed specific interaction of NadA(24-210) with the human β1 integrin subunit. Cumulatively, these results indicate that Y. enterocolitica is a suitable toolbox system for analysis of the adhesive properties of NadA, revealing strong evidence that β1 integrins are important receptors for NadA. Thus, this study demonstrated for the first time a direct interaction between the Oca-family member NadA and human β1 integrins."
19895577,Side chain specificity of ADP-ribosylation by a sirtuin.,"Endogenous mono-ADP-ribosylation in eukaryotes is involved in regulating protein synthesis, signal transduction, cytoskeletal integrity, and cell proliferation, although few cellular ADP-ribosyltransferases have been identified. The sirtuins constitute a highly conserved family of protein deacetylases, and several family members have also been reported to perform protein ADP-ribosylation. We characterized the ADP-ribosylation reaction of the nuclear sirtuin homolog Trypanosoma brucei SIR2-related protein 1 (TbSIR2RP1) on both acetylated and unacetylated substrates. We demonstrated that an acetylated substrate is not required for ADP-ribosylation to occur, indicating that the reaction performed by TbSIR2RP1 is a genuine enzymatic reaction and not a side reaction of deacetylation. Biochemical and MS data showed that arginine is the major ADP-ribose acceptor for unacetylated substrates, whereas arginine does not appear to be the major ADP-ribose acceptor in reactions with acetylated histone H1.1. We performed combined ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical molecular dynamics simulations, which indicated that sirtuin ADP-ribosylation at arginine is energetically feasible, and involves a concerted mechanism with a highly dissociative transition state. In comparison with the corresponding nicotinamide cleavage in the deacetylation reaction, the simulations suggest that sirtuin ADP-ribosylation would be several orders slower but less sensitive to nicotinamide inhibition, which is consistent with experimental results. These results suggest that TbSIR2RP1 can perform ADP-ribosylation using two distinct mechanisms, depending on whether or not the substrate is acetylated."
22522808,An interactome map of the nucleocapsid protein from a highly pathogenic North American porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus strain generated using SILAC-based quantitative proteomics.,Positive strand RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of an infected cell and encode nucleocapsid proteins. These proteins function to promote encapsidation of the RNA genome and virus particle assembly as well as playing potential roles in viral RNA synthesis. Nucleocapsid proteins can also associate with cellular proteins and signaling cascades. The arterivirus nucleocapsid (N) protein is no exception and localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus in virus-infected cells. This study generated an interactome map of the N protein from a highly virulent North American strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). This is a major pathogen of swine resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Crucial to the study was the use of SILAC coupled to affinity purification using GFP-traps and LC-MS/MS. This approach has not been applied before to the investigation of host/viral protein interactomes and this study revealed that the PRRSV N protein interacts with the host cell protein synthesis machinery especially at the level of translation initiation as well as with the RNA post-transcriptional modification machinery. Applications of the dataset can include studies of virus/host interactions and the design of live attenuated recombinant vaccines.
19838188,Crystal structure of TNFalpha complexed with a poxvirus MHC-related TNF binding protein.,The poxvirus 2L protein binds tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) to inhibit host antiviral and immune responses. The 2.8-A 2L-TNFalpha structure reveals three symmetrically arranged 2L molecules per TNFalpha trimer. 2L resembles class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules but lacks a peptide-binding groove and beta2-microglobulin light chain. Overlap between the 2L and host TNF receptor-binding sites on TNFalpha rationalizes 2L inhibition of TNFalpha-TNF receptor interactions and prevention of TNFalpha-induced immune responses.
7680435,Recognition of a high-affinity phosphotyrosyl peptide by the Src homology-2 domain of p56lck.,"The Src homology-2 (SH2) domains are modules of about 100 amino-acid residues that are found in many intracellular signal-transduction proteins. They bind phosphotyrosine-containing sequences with high affinity and specificity, recognizing phosphotyrosine in the context of the immediately adjacent polypeptide sequence. The protein p56lck (Lck) is a Src-like, lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase. A phosphopeptide library screen has recently been used to deduce an 'optimal' binding sequence for the Lck SH2 domain. There is selectivity for the residues Glu, Glu and Ile in the three positions C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine. An 11-residue phosphopeptide derived from the hamster polyoma middle-T antigen, EPQpYEEIPIYL, binds with an approximately 1 nM dissociation constant to the Lck SH2 (ref. 17), an affinity equivalent to that of the tightest known SH2-phosphopeptide complex. We report here the high-resolution crystallographic analysis of the Lck SH2 domain in complex with this phosphopeptide. Recent crystallographically derived structures of the Src SH2 domain in complex with low-affinity peptides, which do not contain the EEI consensus, and NMR-derived structures of unliganded Abl (ref. 19) and p85 (ref. 20) SH2 domains have revealed the conserved fold of the SH2 domain and the properties of a phosphotyrosine binding pocket. Our high-affinity complex shows the presence of a second pocket for the residue (pY + 3) three positions C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (pY). The peptide is anchored by insertion of the pY and pY + 3 side chains into their pockets and by a network of hydrogen bonds to the peptide main chain. In the low-affinity phosphopeptide/Src complexes, the pY + 3 residues do not insert into the homologous binding pocket and the peptide main chain remains displaced from the surface of the domain."
21911578,Proteomic analysis of virus-host interactions in an infectious context using recombinant viruses.,"RNA viruses exhibit small-sized genomes encoding few proteins, but still establish complex networks of interactions with host cell components to achieve replication and spreading. Ideally, these virus-host protein interactions should be mapped directly in infected cell culture, but such a high standard is often difficult to reach when using conventional approaches. We thus developed a new strategy based on recombinant viruses expressing tagged viral proteins to capture both direct and indirect physical binding partners during infection. As a proof of concept, we engineered a recombinant measles virus (MV) expressing one of its virulence factors, the MV-V protein, with a One-STrEP amino-terminal tag. This allowed virus-host protein complex analysis directly from infected cells by combining modified tandem affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis. Using this approach, we established a prosperous list of 245 cellular proteins interacting either directly or indirectly with MV-V, and including four of the nine already known partners of this viral factor. These interactions were highly specific of MV-V because they were not recovered when the nucleoprotein MV-N, instead of MV-V, was tagged. Besides key components of the antiviral response, cellular proteins from mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, protein phosphatase 2A, and histone deacetylase complex were identified for the first time as prominent targets of MV-V and the critical role of the later protein family in MV replication was addressed. Most interestingly, MV-V showed some preferential attachment to essential proteins in the human interactome network, as assessed by centrality and interconnectivity measures. Furthermore, the list of MV-V interactors also showed a massive enrichment for well-known targets of other viruses. Altogether, this clearly supports our approach based on reverse genetics of viruses combined with high-throughput proteomics to probe the interaction network that viruses establish in infected cells."
20436455,Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ORF57 protein interacts with PYM to enhance translation of viral intronless mRNAs.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) expresses numerous intronless mRNAs that are unable to access splicing-dependent cellular mRNA nuclear export pathways. To circumvent this problem, KSHV encodes the open reading frame 57 (ORF57) protein, which orchestrates the formation of an export-competent virus ribonucleoprotein particle comprising the nuclear export complex hTREX, but not the exon-junction complex (EJC). Interestingly, EJCs stimulate mRNA translation, which raises the intriguing question of how intronless KSHV transcripts are efficiently translated. Herein, we show that ORF57 associates with components of the 48S pre-initiation complex and co-sediments with the 40S ribosomal subunits. Strikingly, we observed a direct interaction between ORF57 and PYM, a cellular protein that enhances translation by recruiting the 48S pre-initiation complex to newly exported mRNAs, through an interaction with the EJC. Moreover, detailed biochemical analysis suggests that ORF57 recruits PYM to intronless KSHV mRNA and PYM then facilitates the association of ORF57 and the cellular translation machinery. We, therefore, propose a model whereby ORF57 interacts directly with PYM to enhance translation of intronless KSHV transcripts."
22309289,Akt augments the oncogenic potential of the HBx protein of hepatitis B virus by phosphorylation.,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is a putative viral oncoprotein that plays an important role in various cellular processes, including modulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signalling pathway. However, the molecular mechanism of Akt activation remains elusive. Here we show that HBx interacts with Akt1 kinase and is phosphorylated at serine 31 as indicated by mutational analysis of the Akt recognition motif (creating the HBxS31A mutant) or immunoblotting of HBx immunoprecipitates using Akt motif-specific antibody. The Akt-dependent phosphorylation of HBx was abrogated in the presence of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or Akt1 gene silencing by specific siRNA. Co-immunoprecipitation studies provided evidence for HBx-Akt interaction in a cellular environment. This interaction was also confirmed in hepatoma HepG2.2.15 cells in which HBx was expressed at physiological levels from the integrated hepatitis B viral genome. The HBx-Akt interaction was essential for Akt signalling, and involved displacement of the Akt-bound negative regulator 'C-terminal modulator protein' by HBx. HBx-activated Akt phosphorylated its downstream target glycogen synthase kinase 3β, leading to stabilization of β-catenin, while p65 phosphorylation resulted in enhanced promoter recruitment and expression of target genes encoding cyclin D1 and Bcl-XL. Further, the oncogenic potential of HBx was significantly augmented in the presence of Akt in a soft agar colony formation assay. Together, these results suggest that oncogenic co-operation between HBx and Akt may be important for cell proliferation, abrogation of apoptosis and tumorigenic transformation of cells."
22916011,Identification and targeting of an interaction between a tyrosine motif within hepatitis C virus core protein and AP2M1 essential for viral assembly.,"Novel therapies are urgently needed against hepatitis C virus infection (HCV), a major global health problem. The current model of infectious virus production suggests that HCV virions are assembled on or near the surface of lipid droplets, acquire their envelope at the ER, and egress through the secretory pathway. The mechanisms of HCV assembly and particularly the role of viral-host protein-protein interactions in mediating this process are, however, poorly understood. We identified a conserved heretofore unrecognized YXXΦ motif (Φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue) within the core protein. This motif is homologous to sorting signals within host cargo proteins known to mediate binding of AP2M1, the μ subunit of clathrin adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), and intracellular trafficking. Using microfluidics affinity analysis, protein-fragment complementation assays, and co-immunoprecipitations in infected cells, we show that this motif mediates core binding to AP2M1. YXXΦ mutations, silencing AP2M1 expression or overexpressing a dominant negative AP2M1 mutant had no effect on HCV RNA replication, however, they dramatically inhibited intra- and extracellular infectivity, consistent with a defect in viral assembly. Quantitative confocal immunofluorescence analysis revealed that core's YXXΦ motif mediates recruitment of AP2M1 to lipid droplets and that the observed defect in HCV assembly following disruption of core-AP2M1 binding correlates with accumulation of core on lipid droplets, reduced core colocalization with E2 and reduced core localization to trans-Golgi network (TGN), the presumed site of viral particles maturation. Furthermore, AAK1 and GAK, serine/threonine kinases known to stimulate binding of AP2M1 to host cargo proteins, regulate core-AP2M1 binding and are essential for HCV assembly. Last, approved anti-cancer drugs that inhibit AAK1 or GAK not only disrupt core-AP2M1 binding, but also significantly inhibit HCV assembly and infectious virus production. These results validate viral-host interactions essential for HCV assembly and yield compounds for pharmaceutical development."
23420847,Diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 localizes hepatitis C virus NS5A protein to lipid droplets and enhances NS5A interaction with the viral capsid core.,"The triglyceride-synthesizing enzyme acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) plays a critical role in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by recruiting the HCV capsid protein core onto the surface of cellular lipid droplets (LDs). Here we find a new interaction between the non-structural protein NS5A and DGAT1 and show that the trafficking of NS5A to LDs depends on DGAT1 activity. DGAT1 forms a complex with NS5A and core and facilitates the interaction between both viral proteins. A catalytically inactive mutant of DGAT1 (H426A) blocks the localization of NS5A, but not core, to LDs in a dominant-negative manner and impairs the release of infectious viral particles, underscoring the importance of DGAT1-mediated translocation of NS5A to LDs in viral particle production. We propose a model whereby DGAT1 serves as a cellular hub for HCV core and NS5A proteins, guiding both onto the surface of the same subset of LDs, those generated by DGAT1. These results highlight the critical role of DGAT1 as a host factor for HCV infection and as a potential drug target for antiviral therapy."
22616990,Modulation of the type I interferon pathways by culture-adaptive hepatitis C virus core mutants.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) often establishes a persistent infection that leads to chronic liver diseases. The viral core protein modulates various cellular activities involved in this process. We found two mutations, K23E and V31A, in the core gene of the transfected HCV JFH-1 genome, which had been replicated for a prolonged period. The mutant viruses escaped immunochemical detection by a core-specific antibody and demonstrated enhanced RNA replication and protein expression, compared to the parental virus. The mutant core proteins bound less tightly than the parental type core to the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3 and attenuated the TBK1-mediated activation of interferon-related promoters. These results suggest a mechanism by which the viruses adapt to attenuate cellular antiviral activity and to establish persistent infection."
9143277,Evidence that hepatitis C virus resistance to interferon is mediated through repression of the PKR protein kinase by the nonstructural 5A protein.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of non-A non-B hepatitis and a leading cause of liver dysfunction worldwide. While the current therapy for chronic HCV infection is parenteral administration of type 1 interferon (IFN), only a fraction of HCV-infected individuals completely respond to treatment. Previous studies have correlated the IFN sensitivity of strain HCV-1b with mutations within a discrete region of the viral nonstructural 5A protein (NS5A), termed the interferon sensitivity determining region (ISDR), suggesting that NS5A may contribute to the IFN-resistant phenotype of HCV. To determine the importance of HCV NS5A and the NS5A ISDR in mediating HCV IFN resistance, we tested whether the NS5A protein could regulate the IFN-induced protein kinase, PKR, a mediator of IFN-induced antiviral resistance and a target of viral and cellular inhibitors. Using multiple approaches, including biochemical, transfection, and yeast genetics analyses, we can now report that NS5A represses PKR through a direct interaction with the protein kinase catalytic domain and that both PKR repression and interaction requires the ISDR. Thus, inactivation of PKR may be one mechanism by which HCV avoids the antiviral effects of IFN. Finally the inhibition of the PKR protein kinase, by NS5A is the first described function for this HCV protein."
12855699,Interaction between the varicella zoster virus IE62 major transactivator and cellular transcription factor Sp1.,"The varicella zoster virus (VZV) IE62 protein is involved in the activation of expression of all three kinetic classes of VZV proteins. Analysis of the viral promoter for VZV glycoprotein I has shown that the cellular factor Sp1 is involved in or required for the observed IE62 mediated activation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that the two proteins are present in a complex in VZV-infected cells. Protein affinity pull-down assays using recombinant proteins showed that IE62 and Sp1 interact in the absence of any other viral and cellular proteins. Mapping studies using GST-fusion proteins containing truncations of IE62 and Sp1 have delimited the interacting regions to amino acids 612-778 in Sp1 and amino acids 226-299 in IE62. The region identified in Sp1 is involved in DNA-binding, synergistic Sp1 activation, and Sp1 interaction with cellular transcription factors. The interacting region identified in IE62 overlaps with or borders on sites involved in interactions with the VZV IE4 protein and the cellular factors TBP and TFIIB. Assays using wild-type and mutant promoter elements indicate that Sp1 is involved in recruitment of IE62 to the gI promoter and IE62 enhances Sp1 and TBP binding."
19901337,Crystal structure of NL63 respiratory coronavirus receptor-binding domain complexed with its human receptor.,"NL63 coronavirus (NL63-CoV), a prevalent human respiratory virus, is the only group I coronavirus known to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor. Incidentally, ACE2 is also used by group II SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We investigated how different groups of coronaviruses recognize the same receptor, whereas homologous group I coronaviruses recognize different receptors. We determined the crystal structure of NL63-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) complexed with human ACE2. NL63-CoV RBD has a novel beta-sandwich core structure consisting of 2 layers of beta-sheets, presenting 3 discontinuous receptor-binding motifs (RBMs) to bind ACE2. NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV have no structural homology in RBD cores or RBMs; yet the 2 viruses recognize common ACE2 regions, largely because of a ""virus-binding hotspot"" on ACE2. Among group I coronaviruses, RBD cores are conserved but RBMs are variable, explaining how these viruses recognize different receptors. These results provide a structural basis for understanding viral evolution and virus-receptor interactions."
24009866,Interaction of hepatitis C virus core protein with janus kinase is required for efficient production of infectious viruses.,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is responsible for the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV core protein plays not only a structural role in the virion morphogenesis by encapsidating a virus RNA genome but also a non-structural role in HCV-induced pathogenesis by blocking innate immunity. Especially, it has been shown to regulate JAK-STAT signaling pathway through its direct interaction with Janus kinase (JAK) via its proline-rich JAK-binding motif ((79)PGYPWP(84)). However, little is known about the physiological significance of this HCV core-JAK association in the context of the virus life cycle. In order to gain an insight, a mutant HCV genome (J6/JFH1-79A82A) was constructed to express the mutant core with a defective JAK-binding motif ((79)AGYAWP(84)) using an HCV genotype 2a infectious clone (J6/JFH1). When this mutant HCV genome was introduced into hepatocarcinoma cells, it was found to be severely impaired in its ability to produce infectious viruses in spite of its robust RNA genome replication. Taken together, all these results suggest an essential requirement of HCV core-JAK protein interaction for efficient production of infectious viruses and the potential of using core-JAK blockers as a new anti-HCV therapy."
23935497,Rab18 binds to hepatitis C virus NS5A and promotes interaction between sites of viral replication and lipid droplets.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that replicates on endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes. HCV particle assembly is dependent on the association of core protein with cellular lipid droplets (LDs). However, it remains uncertain whether HCV assembly occurs at the LD membrane itself or at closely associated ER membranes. Furthermore, it is not known how the HCV replication complex and progeny genomes physically associate with the presumed sites of virion assembly at or near LDs. Using an unbiased proteomic strategy, we have found that Rab18 interacts with the HCV nonstructural protein NS5A. Rab18 associates with LDs and is believed to promote physical interaction between LDs and ER membranes. Active (GTP-bound) forms of Rab18 bind more strongly to NS5A than a constitutively GDP-bound mutant. NS5A colocalizes with Rab18-positive LDs in HCV-infected cells, and Rab18 appears to promote the physical association of NS5A and other replicase components with LDs. Modulation of Rab18 affects genome replication and possibly also the production of infectious virions. Our results support a model in which specific interactions between viral and cellular proteins may promote the physical interaction between membranous HCV replication foci and lipid droplets."
22321644,Pro42 and Val45 of staphylokinase modulate intermolecular interactions of His43-Tyr44 pair and specificity of staphylokinase-plasmin activator complex.,"Staphylokinase (SAK) forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasmin (Pm) and changes its substrate specificity to create a plasminogen (Pg) activator complex. The His(43)-Tyr(44) pair of SAK resides within the active site cleft of the partner Pm and generates intermolecular contacts to confer Pg activator ability to the SAK-Pm bimolecular complex. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies unravelled that mutation at 42nd or 45th positions of SAK specifically disrupts cation-pi interaction of His(43) with Trp(215) of partner Pm within the active site, whereas pi-pi interaction of Tyr(44) with Trp(215) remain energetically favoured."
9188558,Nuclear localization of the NS3 protein of hepatitis C virus and factors affecting the localization.,"Subcellular localization of the NS2 and NS3 proteins of hepatitis C virus was analyzed. In stable Ltk transfectants inducibly expressing an NS2-NS3 polyprotein (amino acids [aa] 810 to 1463), processed full-size NS2 (aa 810 to 1026) was detected exclusively in a cytoplasmic membrane fraction. On the other hand, the other processed product, carboxy-truncated NS3 (NS3 deltaC1463; aa 1027 to 1463), was present in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. To further analyze subcellular localization of NS3, NS3 deltaC1459 (aa 1027 to 1459), full-size NS3 (NS3F; aa 1027 to 1657), and both amino- and carboxy-truncated NS3 (NS3 deltaNdeltaC; aa 1201 to 1459) were expressed in HeLa cells by using a vaccinia virus-T7 hybrid expression system. NS3 deltaC1459 and NS3F accumulated in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm, exhibiting a dot-like staining pattern. On the other hand, NS3 deltaNdeltaC was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, suggesting the presence of a nuclear localization signal(s) in the amino-terminal sequence of NS3. NS4A, a viral cofactor for the NS3 protease, inhibited nuclear transport of NS3 deltaC1459 and NS3F, with the latter inhibited to a lesser extent than was the former. Interestingly, wild-type p53 tumor suppressor augmented nuclear localization of NS3 deltaC1459 and NS3F, whereas mutant-type p53 inhibited nuclear localization and augmented cytoplasmic localization of NS3 deltaC1459. However, subcellular localization of NS3 deltaNdeltaC was not affected by either type of p53. Wild-type p53-mediated nuclear accumulation of NS3 deltaC1459 and NS3F was inhibited partially, but not completely, by coexpressed NS4A, with NS3F again affected less prominently than was NS3 deltaC1459."
10734119,"Molecular cloning, genomic organization, and biochemical characterization of myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana.","Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT, EC 2.3.1.97) catalyzes the co-translational addition of myristic acid to the amino-terminal glycine residue of a number of important proteins of diverse functions. We have isolated a full-length Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding NMT (AtNMT1), the first described from a higher plant. This AtNMT1 cDNA clone has an open reading frame of 434 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 48,706 Da. The primary structure is 50% identical to the mammalian NMTs. Analyses of Southern blots, genomic clones, and database sequences suggested that the A. thaliana genome contains two copies of NMT gene, which are present on different chromosomes and have distinct genomic organizations. The recombinant AtNMT1 expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited a high catalytic efficiency for the peptides derived from putative plant myristoylated proteins AtCDPK6 and Fen kinase. The AtNMT was similar to the mammalian NMTs with respect to a relative specificity for myristoyl CoA among the acyl CoA donors and also inhibition by the bovine brain NMT inhibitor NIP(71). The AtNMT1 expression profile indicated ubiquity in roots, stem, leaves, flowers, and siliques (approximately 1.7 kb transcript and approximately 50 kDa immunoreactive polypeptide) but a greater level in the younger tissue, which are developmentally very active. NMT activity was also evident in all these tissues. Subcellular distribution studies indicated that, in leaf extracts, approximately 60% of AtNMT activity was associated with the ribosomal fractions, whereas approximately 30% of the activity was observed in the cytosolic fractions. The NMT is biologically important to plants, as noted from the stunted development when the AtNMT1 was down-regulated in transgenic Arabidopsis under the control of an enhanced CaMV 35S promoter. The results presented in this study provide the first direct molecular evidence for plant protein N-myristoylation and a mechanistic basis for understanding the role of this protein modification in plants."
12736686,Pathogenic bacteria attach to human fibronectin through a tandem beta-zipper.,"Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, two important human pathogens, target host fibronectin (Fn) in their adhesion to and invasion of host cells. Fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs), anchored in the bacterial cell wall, have multiple Fn-binding repeats in an unfolded region of the protein. The bacterium-binding site in the amino-terminal domain (1-5F1) of Fn contains five sequential Fn type 1 (F1) modules. Here we show the structure of a streptococcal (S. dysgalactiae) FnBP peptide (B3) in complex with the module pair 1F12F1. This identifies 1F1- and 2F1-binding motifs in B3 that form additional antiparallel beta-strands on sequential F1 modules-the first example of a tandem beta-zipper. Sequence analyses of larger regions of FnBPs from S. pyogenes and S. aureus reveal a repeating pattern of F1-binding motifs that match the pattern of F1 modules in 1-5F1 of Fn. In the process of Fn-mediated invasion of host cells, therefore, the bacterial proteins seem to exploit the modular structure of Fn by forming extended tandem beta-zippers. This work is a vital step forward in explaining the full mechanism of the integrin-dependent FnBP-mediated invasion of host cells."
15856031,Transformed immortalized gastric epithelial cells by virulence factor CagA of Helicobacter pylori through Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.,"CagA of Helicobacter pylori is a protein that has been closely associated with gastric cancer and that can intervene with signal pathways in cells. Its precise relationship with the occurrence of gastric cancer, however, remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether CagA can promote transformation of normal gastric epithelial cells and to consider via what mechanisms CagA may exert its effects. Transformed colonies were merged in soft-agarose medium after immortalized gastric epithelial cells were transfected with recombinant pLHCX retrovirus with cagA and/or dimethylhydrazine. The number of transformed colonies in the group containing cagA/pLHCX retrovirus, combined with a subthreshold dose of dimethylhydrazine, was more than that for cagA/pLHCX retrovirus or dimethylhydrazine at a subthreshold dose alone. For cagA-transfected cells, only IQGAP-2, R-Ras and B-Raf of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal pathway were markedly increased, and the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) kinase was significantly higher than that in dimethylhydrazine-transformed cells or control cells. However, no evidence of alteration of any other molecules of the Ras superfamily was observed in cagA-transfected cells. These findings suggest that CagA can transform gastric epithelial cells through activation of the Erk1/2 pathway; this mechanism may, however, be independent of Ras activation."
9783753,The ternary microplasmin-staphylokinase-microplasmin complex is a proteinase-cofactor-substrate complex in action.,"The serine proteinase plasmin is the key fibrinolytic enzyme that dissolves blood clots and also promotes cell migration and tissue remodeling. Here, we report the 2.65 A crystal structure of a ternary complex of microplasmin-staphylokinase bound to a second microplasmin. The staphylokinase 'cofactor' does not affect the active-site geometry of the plasmin 'enzyme', but instead modifies its subsite specificity by providing additional docking sites for enhanced presentation of the plasminogen 'substrate' to the 'enzymes's' active site. The activation loop of the plasmin 'substrate', cleaved in these crystals, can be reconstructed to show how it runs across the active site of the plasmin 'enzyme' prior to activation cleavage. This is the first experimental structure of a productive proteinase-cofactor-macromolecular substrate complex. Furthermore, it provides a template for the design of improved plasminogen activators and plasmin inhibitors with considerable therapeutical potential."
12538863,Biochemical characterization of the Yersinia YopT protease: cleavage site and recognition elements in Rho GTPases.,"The Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Yersinia delivers six effector proteins into the host cells to thwart the host innate immune response. One of the effectors, YopT, causes the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and contributes to the inhibition of phagocytosis of the pathogen. YopT functions as a cysteine protease to cleave Rho family GTPases. We have analyzed the YopT cleavage products of Rho GTPases by TLC and determined their chemical structure by MS. Amino acid labeling experiments were performed to locate the exact site in RhoA where the YopT cleavage occurs. Our data unambiguously demonstrate that YopT cleaves N-terminal to the prenylated cysteine in RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 and that the cleavage product of the GTPases is geranylgeranyl cysteine methyl ester. YopT cleaves GTP- and GDP-bound forms of RhoA equally, suggesting that the cleavage does not depend upon the conformation status of the GTPases. YopT also cleaves both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated forms of RhoA. The polybasic sequence in the C terminus of RhoA is essential for YopT substrate recognition and cleavage."
14612521,Induction of chromosomal instability in colonic cells by the human polyomavirus JC virus.,"Most colorectal cancers display chromosomal instability, which is characterized by gross chromosomal rearrangements, loss of heterozygosity and aneuploidy. We have previously demonstrated a link between JC virus strains Mad-1 and Delta98 and colorectal cancer. Others have also associated the virus to the induction of colon cancer and aneuploid brain tumors by producing a highly tumorigenic protein named T antigen (TAg), which binds to beta-catenin and inactivates key proteins such as p53. The aim is to demonstrate that JC virus is capable of inducing chromosomal instability in colonic cells. We used the human colon cancer cell line RKO as a model. The cell line has wild-type p53, wild-type beta-catenin and APC and is diploid. Neuroblastoma JCI cells, which are infected with the virus, VA13 fibroblasts, which are transformed by the SV40 TAg, were used as positive controls. HCT116, which has mutated beta-catenin, and SW480, which is a model of CIN, were also used as controls. The genomes of the Mad-1 and Delta98 strains were transfected into cells. As negative controls we used pUC or no plasmids. Cells were collected at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days after transfection. PCR was used for the detection of TAg and the regulatory region DNA sequences at different time frames and Southern blot of whole genomic extracts for viral DNA integration into the host genome. Immunofluorescence and Western blot were performed for TAg, viral capsid proteins, and nuclear beta-catenin expressions, whereas coimmunoprecipitation was used to detect protein interactions. Karyotype analysis and electron microscopy were performed to seek chromosomal instability and cell abnormalities, respectively. Retention of viral sequences was observed for Mad-1- and Delta98-transfected RKO cells at all time frames with PCR only, whereas Southern blot analysis showed nonintegrated sequences at T7 alone. TAg and capsid protein expressions, as well as increased p53 and nuclear beta-catenin, were observed between T0 and T7 for Mad-1 and Delta98 alone. Also, interaction between TAg and both p53 and beta-catenin was also observed between T0 and T7. Chromosomal instability, characterized by chromosomal breakage, dicentric chromosomes, and increasing ploidy, was observed at all time frames for Mad-1 and Delta98, as well as cell abnormalities. In conclusion, we demonstrate that JC virus Mad-1 and Delta98 are able to induce chromosomal instability in colonic cells with a hit and run mechanism that involves an early interaction with beta-catenin and p53."
15084396,La protein binds to NS5 and NS3 and to the 5' and 3' ends of Dengue 4 virus RNA.,"In vitro replication of dengue virus requires the presence of cis-acting elements within the 5' end and the 3' UTR of the viral genome. Some, like the putative cyclization sites (PCS), may promote interaction at both ends of the viral genome. To investigate whether viral or cellular proteins could be involved in this interaction, UV-induced cross-linking assays using extracts from the monocytic cell line U937 were performed. Our data demonstrate that the 5' end and the 3' UTR with the PCS interact with five cellular proteins with the same molecular weight. When both regions were differentially labeled, with biotin and 32P, respectively, the interaction of at least seven proteins with both ends could be demonstrated. Immunoprecipitation assays also demonstrate that La protein binds to the 5' end and with the 3' UTR. Moreover, these proteins also interact with the nonstructural proteins NS5 and NS3. The role of the NS5-La and NS3-La interaction in U937 cells remains to be established."
12724329,Interaction of glycoprotein H of human herpesvirus 6 with the cellular receptor CD46.,"Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) employs the complement regulator CD46 (membrane cofactor protein) as a receptor for fusion and entry into target cells. Like other known herpesviruses, HHV-6 encodes multiple glycoproteins, several of which have been implicated in the entry process. In this report, we present evidence that glycoprotein H (gH) is the viral component responsible for binding to CD46. Antibodies to CD46 co-immunoprecipitated an approximately 110-kDa protein band specifically associated with HHV-6-infected cells. This protein was identified as gH by selective depletion with an anti-gH monoclonal antibody, as well as by immunoblot analysis with a rabbit hyperimmune serum directed against a gH synthetic peptide. In reciprocal experiments, a monoclonal antibody against HHV-6 gH was found to co-immunoprecipitate CD46. Studies using monoclonal antibodies directed against specific CD46 domains, as well as engineered constructs lacking defined CD46 regions, demonstrated a close correspondence between the CD46 domains involved in the interaction with gH and those previously shown to be critical for HHV-6 fusion (i.e. short consensus repeats 2 and 3)."
15107016,Heterotypic interactions among NACHT domains: implications for regulation of innate immune responses.,"Proteins of the NACHT [NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein), CIITA (MHC class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus protein from Podospora anserina) and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein)] family may serve as critical pathogen-sensing and signal-transducing molecules within the innate immune system. In the present paper, we show that CLAN [CARD (caspase-recruitment domain), LRR (leucine-rich repeat) and NACHT domain-containing protein], a NACHT-containing protein originally demonstrated to bind and activate pro-caspase 1, is also capable of influencing the functions of other members of the NACHT family. Through heterotypic NACHT-domain interactions, CLAN was found to associate with Nod1, Nod2 and NAC [nucleotide-binding domain and CARD-containing protein; NALP1 (NACHT, LRR and PYRIN protein 1)] when co-expressed in HEK-293T (human embryonic kidney) cells. NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) reporter assays demonstrated that co-expression of either full-length CLAN or the NACHT domain of CLAN significantly inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by Nod1 or Nod2 overexpression. In addition, co-expression of CLAN or the NACHT domain of CLAN with Nod1 or Nod2 inhibited the ability of these proteins to generate active IL-1beta (interleukin 1beta) through their association with pro-caspase 1. The NACHT domain of CLAN was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments to bind all NACHT domains that were tested, including the NACHT domains from CLAN itself, Nod1, Nod2, cryopyrin, NAC, PAN2 [PAAD [pyrin, AIM (absent-in-melanoma), ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and death-domain-like]- and NACHT-containing protein] and NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein). Finally, monocyte-expressed CLAN was found to associate with Nod2 following exposure to bacterial peptidoglycan, implying a regulatory role for interaction of these NACHT proteins in the innate immune response. These studies suggest that by mediating hetero-oligomerization, NACHT domains provide a means by which various NACHT-containing proteins may interact, creating protein-interaction networks that potentially modulate immune responses to invading pathogens."
12775719,CARD6 is a modulator of NF-kappa B activation by Nod1- and Cardiak-mediated pathways.,"We cloned a novel cDNA derived from the CARD6 gene locus on chromosome 5p12 of 311 amino acids in length. By immunoprecipitation we detected specific binding of this CARD6-encoding protein to Nod1 (CARD4), Cardiak (Rip2/Rick), NAC (NALP1/DEFCAP/CARD7), and TUCAN (CARD8/Cardinal/NDPP/Dakar), caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins implicated in NF-kappa B and caspase-1 activation but not to other CARD family proteins. Cardiak and Nod1 (but not other CARD proteins) also exhibited opposing effects on CARD6 protein phosphorylation and expression, providing further evidence of functional interactions among these proteins in cells. In transfection experiments, the CARD6 protein suppressed NF-kappa B induction by Nod1 or Cardiak but did not interfere with NF-kappa B activation by the CARD-containing adapter protein Bcl10 or the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha, demonstrating specificity of CARD6 for Nod-1 and Cardiak-dependent pathways. In contrast to its effects on Nod1- and Cardiak-dependent NF-kappa B activation, CARD6 did not interfere with caspase-1-dependent interleukin-1 beta secretion induced by Cardiak or Nod1. CARD6 also did not affect caspase activation and apoptosis induced by overexpression of Fas, Bax, or other pro-apoptotic stimuli. Thus, CARD6 represents a selective modulator of NF-kappa B activation by Cardiak and Nod1, adding to the repertoire of CARD-family proteins implicated in inflammatory responses and innate immunity."
8380462,Papillomavirus E7 protein binding to the retinoblastoma protein is not required for viral induction of warts.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the etiologic agents responsible for benign epithelial proliferative disorders including genital warts and are a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. HPVs demonstrate strict species and cell-type specificity, which is manifested by the inability of these viruses to induce disease in any species other than humans. The natural history of HPV infection in humans is closely mimicked by cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) infection in domestic laboratory rabbits. The CRPV E7 gene is known to play an essential role in virus-mediated induction of papillomas. We now show by mutational analysis that the CRPV E7 protein's biochemical and biological properties, including binding to the retinoblastoma suppressor protein (pRB), transcription factor E2F transactivation of the adenovirus E2 promoter, disruption of pRB-E2F complexes, and cellular transformation as measured by growth in soft agar, mimic those of the HPV E7 protein. Intradermal injection of CRPV DNA lacking E7 gene sequences critical for the binding of the CRPV E7 protein to pRB induced papillomas in rabbits. These studies indicate that E7 protein binding to pRB is not required in the molecular pathogenesis of virally induced warts and suggest that other properties intrinsic to the E7 protein are necessary for papilloma formation."
12960323,The WD motif-containing protein RACK-1 functions as a scaffold protein within the type I IFN receptor-signaling complex.,"The WD repeat-containing protein receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK)-1 has been linked to a variety of signaling systems including protein kinase C, growth factors, and IFNs. In the IFN system, RACK-1 functions as an adaptor recruiting the transcription factor STAT1 to the receptor complex. However, RACK-1 should play a broader role in type I IFN signaling because mutation of the RACK-1 binding site in the IFN-alpha receptor 2/beta subunit of the type I IFN receptor abrogates not only STAT1, but also STAT2, activation. In this study, we demonstrate that RACK-1 serves as a scaffold protein for a multiprotein complex that includes the IFN-alpha receptor 2/beta-chain of the receptor, STAT1, Janus kinase 1, and tyrosine kinase 2. In vitro data further suggest that within this complex tyrosine kinase 2 is the tyrosine kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of STAT1. Finally, we provide evidence that RACK-1 may also serve as a scaffold protein in other cytokine systems such as IL-2, IL-4, and erythropoietin."
16322229,Hepatitis C virus core protein inhibits tumor suppressor protein promyelocytic leukemia function in human hepatoma cells.,"Tumor suppressor protein promyelocytic leukemia (PML) is implicated in apoptosis regulation and antiviral response. PML localizes predominantly to PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NB), nuclear macromolecular complexes regulating tumor suppressor protein p53 activity. Consistent with the function of PML in the cellular antiviral response, PML-NBs represent preferential targets in viral infections. In the case of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, important characteristics are nonresponsiveness to IFN therapy and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanisms which lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma are largely unknown. Here, we show that HCV core protein localizes to the cell nucleus in PML-NBs, where it colocalizes with p53. The HCV core interacts with endogenously expressed PML isoform IV (PML-IV), a key regulator of p53 activity. Importantly, we show that HCV core protein inhibits PML-IV-induced apoptosis and interferes with the coactivator function of PML-IV for proapoptotic p53 target genes including CD95 (Fas/APO-1). In particular, we found that the HCV core inhibits p53-mediated target gene expression by predominantly targeting the coactivator function of PML-IV because HCV core-mediated p53 target gene repression was absent in PML-ablated cells. HCV core expression abrogated both p53 serine 15 phosphorylation and lysine 382 acetylation, two p53-activating posttranslational modifications which were previously linked to an increased PML-NB formation. Taken together, our results suggest a potential mechanism for HCV-associated development of hepatocellular carcinoma through HCV core-mediated inactivation of the PML tumor suppressor pathway."
23487458,Modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 3 by hepatitis C virus core protein.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly dependent on cellular proteins for its own propagation. In order to identify the cellular factors involved in HCV propagation, we performed protein microarray assays using the HCV core protein as a probe. Of ~9,000 host proteins immobilized in a microarray, approximately 100 cellular proteins were identified as HCV core-interacting partners. Of these candidates, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPKAPK3) was selected for further characterization. MAPKAPK3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated by stress and growth inducers. Binding of HCV core to MAPKAPK3 was confirmed by in vitro pulldown assay and further verified by coimmunoprecipitation assay. HCV core protein interacted with MAPKAPK3 through amino acid residues 41 to 75 of core and the N-terminal half of kinase domain of MAPKAPK3. In addition, both RNA and protein levels of MAPKAPK3 were elevated in both HCV subgenomic replicon cells and cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc)-infected cells. Silencing of MAPKAPK3 expression resulted in decreases in both protein and HCV infectivity levels but not in the intracellular HCV RNA level. We showed that MAPKAPK3 increased HCV IRES-mediated translation and MAPKAPK3-dependent HCV IRES activity was further increased by core protein. These data suggest that HCV core may modulate MAPKAPK3 to facilitate its own propagation."
16690937,NS3 protein of Hepatitis C virus associates with the tumour suppressor p53 and inhibits its function in an NS3 sequence-dependent manner.,"The N-terminal 198 residues of NS3 (NS3-N) of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) subtype 1b obtained from 29 patients, as well as full-length NS3 (NS3-Full), were analysed for their subcellular localization, interaction with the tumour suppressor p53 and serine protease activity in the presence and absence of the viral cofactor NS4A. Based on the subcellular-localization patterns in the absence of NS4A, NS3-N sequences were classified into three groups, with each group exhibiting either dot-like, diffuse or a mixed type of localization. Chimeric NS3-Full sequences, each consisting of an individual NS3-N and a shared C-terminal sequence, showed the same localization patterns as those of the respective NS3-N. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that a single or a few amino acid substitutions at a particular position(s) of NS3-N altered the localization pattern. Interestingly, NS3 of the dot-like type, either NS3-N or NS3-Full, interacted with p53 more strongly than that of the diffuse type, in both the presence and the absence of NS4A. Moreover, NS3-N of the dot-like type suppressed trans-activating activity of p53 more strongly than that of the diffuse type. Serine protease activity did not differ significantly between the two types of NS3. In HCV RNA replicon-harbouring cells, physical interaction between NS3 and p53 was observed consistently and p53-mediated transcriptional activation was suppressed significantly compared with HCV RNA-negative control cells. Our results collectively suggest the possibility that NS3 plays an important role in the hepatocarcinogenesis of HCV by interacting differentially with p53 in an NS3 sequence-dependent manner."
21914078,Association of filamin A and vimentin with hepatitis C virus proteins in infected human hepatocytes.,"Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease and remains a major therapeutic challenge. A variety of host proteins interact with HCV proteins. The definitive role of cytoskeletal (CS) proteins in HCV infection remains to be determined. In this study, our aim was to determine the expression profile of differentially regulated and expressed selected CS proteins and their association with HCV proteins in infected hepatocytes as possible therapeutic targets. Using proteomics, qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence techniques, we revealed that filamin A (fila) and vimentin (vim) were prominently increased proteins in HCV-expressing human hepatoma cells compared with parental cells and in liver biopsies from patients with CHC vs controls. HCV nonstructural (NS) 3 and NS5A proteins were associated with fila, while core protein partially with fila and vim. Immunoprecipitation showed interactions among fila and NS3 and NS5A proteins. Cells treated with interferon-α showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in CS and HCV proteins. NS proteins clustered at the perinuclear region following cytochalasin b treatment, whereas disperse cytoplasmic and perinuclear distribution was observed in the no-treatment group. This study demonstrates and signifies that changes occur in the expression of CS proteins in HCV-infected hepatocytes and, for the first time, shows the up-regulation and interaction of fila with HCV proteins. Association between CS and HCV proteins may have implications in future design of CS protein-targeted therapy for the treatment for HCV infection."
18562541,Association of hepatitis C virus replication complexes with microtubules and actin filaments is dependent on the interaction of NS3 and NS5A.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication complex (RC), which is composed of viral nonstructural (NS) proteins and host cellular proteins, replicates the viral RNA genome in association with intracellular membranes. Two viral NS proteins, NS3 and NS5A, are essential elements of the RC. Here, by using immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays, we demonstrated that NS3 and NS5A interact with tubulin and actin. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy revealed that HCV RCs were aligned along microtubules and actin filaments in both HCV replicon cells and HCV-infected cells. In addition, the movement of RCs was inhibited when microtubules or actin filaments were depolymerized by colchicine and cytochalasin B, respectively. Based on our observations, we propose that microtubules and actin filaments provide the tracks for the movement of HCV RCs to other regions in the cell, and the molecular interactions between RCs and microtubules, or RCs and actin filaments, are mediated by NS3 and NS5A."
16380082,Single-point mutations of hepatitis C virus NS3 that impair p53 interaction and anti-apoptotic activity of NS3.,"The N-terminal domain of NS3 of hepatitis C virus (HCV) possesses serine protease activity, which is essential for virus replication. This portion is also implicated in malignant transformation of hepatocytes. We previously demonstrated that an N-terminal portion of NS3 formed a complex with the tumor suppressor p53 and suppressed actinomycin D-induced apoptosis. We report here that single-point mutations of NS3 at position 106 from Leu to Ala (L106A), and position 43 from Phe to Ala (F43A) to a lesser extent, significantly impaired complex formation with p53. Moreover, the L106A mutation impaired an otherwise more distinct anti-apoptotic activity of NS3. F43A and L106A mutations also inhibited serine protease activity of NS3. These results collectively suggest the possibility that Leu106 and Phe43 are involved in p53 interaction and serine protease activity, and therefore, can be a good target for certain low-molecular-weight compound(s) to inhibit both oncogenic and replicative abilities of HCV."
11773402,Detection of a novel unglycosylated form of hepatitis C virus E2 envelope protein that is located in the cytosol and interacts with PKR.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope protein E2 has been shown to accumulate in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a properly folded glycoprotein as well as large aggregates of misfolded proteins. In the present study, we have identified an additional unglycosylated species, with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa (E2-p38). In contrast to the glycosylated E2, E2-p38 is significantly less stable and is degraded through the proteasome pathway. Correspondingly, E2-p38 is found to be ubiquitinated. E2-p38 is localized mostly in the cytosol, in contrast to the glycosylated form, which is exclusively membrane associated. Alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) treatment or overexpression of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) significantly increased the stability of E2-p38, consistent with a previous report (D. R. Taylor, S. T. Shi, P. R. Romano, G. N. Barber, and M. M. Lai, Science 285:107-110, 1999) that E2 interacts with PKR and inhibits its kinase activity. Direct interaction between PKR and E2-p38, but not the glycosylated form of E2, was also observed. These results show that E2-p38 is the form of E2 that interacts with PKR in the cytosol and may contribute to the resistance of HCV to IFN-alpha. Thus, an ER protein can exist in the cytosol as an unglycosylated species and impair cellular functions."
21849455,Y-box-binding protein 1 interacts with hepatitis C virus NS3/4A and influences the equilibrium between viral RNA replication and infectious particle production.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protein has several essential roles in the virus life cycle, most probably through dynamic interactions with host factors. To discover cellular cofactors that are co-opted by HCV for its replication, we elucidated the NS3/4A interactome using mass spectrometry and identified Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1) as an interacting partner of NS3/4A protein and HCV genomic RNA. Importantly, silencing YB-1 expression decreased viral RNA replication and severely impaired the propagation of the infectious HCV molecular clone JFH-1. Immunofluorescence studies further revealed a drastic HCV-dependent redistribution of YB-1 to the surface of the lipid droplets, an important organelle for HCV assembly. Core and NS3 protein-dependent polyprotein maturation were shown to be required for YB-1 relocalization. Unexpectedly, YB-1 knockdown cells showed the increased production of viral infectious particles while HCV RNA replication was impaired. Our data support that HCV hijacks YB-1-containing ribonucleoparticles and that YB-1-NS3/4A-HCV RNA complexes regulate the equilibrium between HCV RNA replication and viral particle production."
21297162,Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type IIIalpha and regulates viral propagation.,"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) nonstructural 5A (NS5A) is a pleiotropic protein involved in viral RNA replication and modulation of the cellular physiology in HCV-infected cells. To elucidate the mechanisms of the HCV life cycle, we identified cellular factors interacting with the NS5A protein in HCV-infected cells. Huh7.5 cells were electroporated with HCV Jc1 RNA. Cellular factors associated with HCV NS5A were identified by immunoprecipitation with Dynabead-conjugated NS5A antibody and LC-MS/MS. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type IIIα (PI4KIIIα) was identified as a binding partner for the NS5A protein. NS5A derived from both genotypes 1b and 2a interacted with PI4KIIIα. NS5A interacted with PI4KIIIα through amino acids 401-600 of PI4KIIIα and domain I of NS5A. Interference of the protein interaction between NS5A and PI4KIIIα decreased HCV propagation. Knockdown of PI4KIIIα significantly reduced HCV replication in Huh7 cells harboring the subgenomic replicon and in Huh7.5 cells infected with cell culture grown virus (HCVcc). Silencing of PI4KIIIα further inhibited HCV release into the tissue culture medium. NS5A may recruit PI4KIIIα to the HCV RNA replication complex. These data suggest that PI4KIIIα is an essential host factor that supports HCV proliferation and therefore PI4KIIIα may be a legitimate target for anti-HCV therapy."
23427160,Hepatitis C virus replication is modulated by the interaction of nonstructural protein NS5B and fatty acid synthase.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that acts as a key player in the HCV replication complex. Understanding the interplay between the viral and cellular components of the HCV replication complex could provide new insight for prevention of the progression of HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, the NS5B protein was used as the bait in a pulldown assay to screen for NS5B-interacting proteins that are present in Huh7 hepatoma cell lysates. After mass spectrophotometric analysis, fatty acid synthase (FASN) was found to interact with NS5B. Coimmunoprecipitation and double staining assays further confirmed the direct binding between NS5B and FASN. The domain of NS5B that interacts with FASN was also determined. Moreover, FASN was associated with detergent-resistant lipid rafts and colocalized with NS5B in active HCV replication complexes. In addition, overexpression of FASN enhanced HCV expression in Huh7/Rep-Feo cells, while transfection of FASN small interfering RNA (siRNA) or treatment with FASN-specific inhibitors decreased HCV replication and viral production. Notably, FASN directly increased HCV NS5B RdRp activity in vitro. These results together indicate that FASN interacts with NS5B and modulates HCV replication through a direct increase of NS5B RdRp activity. FASN may thereby serve as a target for the treatment of HCV infection and the prevention of HCV-associated HCC progression."
23593007,Lipid droplet-binding protein TIP47 regulates hepatitis C Virus RNA replication through interaction with the viral NS5A protein.,"The nonstructural protein NS5A has emerged as a new drug target in antiviral therapies for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection. NS5A is critically involved in viral RNA replication that takes place at newly formed membranes within the endoplasmic reticulum (membranous web) and assists viral assembly in the close vicinity of lipid droplets (LDs). To identify host proteins that interact with NS5A, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the N-terminus of NS5A (amino acids 1-31), a well-studied α-helical domain important for the membrane tethering of NS5A. Our studies identified the LD-associated host protein, Tail-Interacting Protein 47 (TIP47) as a novel NS5A interaction partner. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in Huh7 hepatoma cells confirmed the interaction of TIP47 with full-length NS5A. shRNA-mediated knockdown of TIP47 caused a more than 10-fold decrease in the propagation of full-length infectious HCV in Huh7.5 hepatoma cells. A similar reduction was observed when TIP47 was knocked down in cells harboring an autonomously replicating HCV RNA (subgenomic replicon), indicating that TIP47 is required for efficient HCV RNA replication. A single point mutation (W9A) in NS5A that disrupts the interaction with TIP47 but preserves proper subcellular localization severely decreased HCV RNA replication. In biochemical membrane flotation assays, TIP47 cofractionated with HCV NS3, NS5A, NS5B proteins, and viral RNA, and together with nonstructural viral proteins was uniquely distributed to lower-density LD-rich membrane fractions in cells actively replicating HCV RNA. Collectively, our data support a model where TIP47--via its interaction with NS5A--serves as a novel cofactor for HCV infection possibly by integrating LD membranes into the membranous web."
23675303,The lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase III alpha regulates the phosphorylation status of hepatitis C virus NS5A.,"The lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4KIIIα) is an essential host factor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. PI4KIIIα catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) accumulating in HCV replicating cells due to enzyme activation resulting from its interaction with nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A). This study describes the interaction between PI4KIIIα and NS5A and its mechanistic role in viral RNA replication. We mapped the NS5A sequence involved in PI4KIIIα interaction to the carboxyterminal end of domain 1 and identified a highly conserved PI4KIIIα functional interaction site (PFIS) encompassing seven amino acids, which are essential for viral RNA replication. Mutations within this region were also impaired in NS5A-PI4KIIIα binding, reduced PI4P levels and altered the morphology of viral replication sites, reminiscent to the phenotype observed by silencing of PI4KIIIα. Interestingly, abrogation of RNA replication caused by mutations in the PFIS correlated with increased levels of hyperphosphorylated NS5A (p58), indicating that PI4KIIIα affects the phosphorylation status of NS5A. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PI4KIIIα or pharmacological ablation of kinase activity led to a relative increase of p58. In contrast, overexpression of enzymatically active PI4KIIIα increased relative abundance of basally phosphorylated NS5A (p56). PI4KIIIα therefore regulates the phosphorylation status of NS5A and viral RNA replication by favoring p56 or repressing p58 synthesis. Replication deficiencies of PFIS mutants in NS5A could not be rescued by increasing PI4P levels, but by supplying functional NS5A, supporting an essential role of PI4KIIIα in HCV replication regulating NS5A phosphorylation, thereby modulating the morphology of viral replication sites. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PI4KIIIα activity affects the NS5A phosphorylation status. Our results highlight the importance of PI4KIIIα in the morphogenesis of viral replication sites and its regulation by facilitating p56 synthesis."
23552417,Human La protein interaction with GCAC near the initiator AUG enhances hepatitis C Virus RNA replication by promoting linkage between 5' and 3' untranslated regions.,"Human La protein has been implicated in facilitating the internal initiation of translation as well as replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA. Previously, we demonstrated that La interacts with the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) around the GCAC motif near the initiator AUG within stem-loop IV by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) (residues 112 to 184) and influences HCV translation. In this study, we have deciphered the role of this interaction in HCV replication in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell culture system. We incorporated mutation of the GCAC motif in an HCV monocistronic subgenomic replicon and a pJFH1 construct which altered the binding of La and checked HCV RNA replication by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The mutation drastically affected HCV replication. Furthermore, to address whether the decrease in replication is a consequence of translation inhibition or not, we incorporated the same mutation into a bicistronic replicon and observed a substantial decrease in HCV RNA levels. Interestingly, La overexpression rescued this inhibition of replication. More importantly, we observed that the mutation reduced the association between La and NS5B. The effect of the GCAC mutation on the translation-to-replication switch, which is regulated by the interplay between NS3 and La, was further investigated. Additionally, our analyses of point mutations in the GCAC motif revealed distinct roles of each nucleotide in HCV replication and translation. Finally, we showed that a specific interaction of the GCAC motif with human La protein is crucial for linking 5' and 3' ends of the HCV genome. Taken together, our results demonstrate the mechanism of regulation of HCV replication by interaction of the cis-acting element GCAC within the HCV IRES with human La protein."
9827557,Complex formation of the nonstructural protein 3 of hepatitis C virus with the p53 tumor suppressor.,"By co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we demonstrated that wt-p53 formed a complex with non-structural protein (NS) 3 of hepatitis C virus, both in the absence and the presence of NS4A, a viral cofactor that strongly associates with NS3. Deletional analysis revealed that a portion near the N-terminus of NS3 (amino acids (aa) 1055 and 1200), which is different from the NS4A binding site, was necessary for the complex formation with wt-p53. On the other hand, a portion near the C-terminus of wt-p53 (aa 301-360), which has been reported to contain the oligomerization domain, was important for the complex formation with NS3."
17301141,"Participation of rab5, an early endosome protein, in hepatitis C virus RNA replication machinery.","Like most positive-strand RNA viruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is believed to replicate its genome on the surface of rearranged membranes. We have shown previously that HCV NS4AB, but not the product NS4B, inhibits endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi protein traffic (K. V. Konan, T. H. Giddings, Jr., M. Ikeda, K. Li, S. M. Lemon, and K. Kirkegaard, J. Virol. 77:7843-7855). However, both NS4AB and NS4B can induce ""membranous web"" formation, first reported by Egger et al. (D. B Egger, R. Gosert, L. Bianchi, H. E. Blum, D. Moradpour, and K. Bienz, J. Virol. 76:5974-5984), which is also observed in HCV-infected cells (Y. Rouille, F. Helle, D. Delgrange, P. Roingeard, C. Voisset, E. Blanchard, S. Belouzard, J. McKeating, A. H. Patel, G. Maertens, T. Wakita, C. Wychowski, and J. Dubuisson, J. Virol. 80:2832-2841) and cells that bear a subgenomic NS5A-green fluorescent protein (GFP) replicon (D. Moradpour, M. J. Evans, R. Gosert, Z. Yuan, H. E. Blum, S. P. Goff, B. D. Lindenbach, and C. M. Rice, J. Virol. 78:7400-7409). To determine the intracellular origin of the web, we examined NS4B colocalization with endogenous cellular markers in the context of the full-length or subgenomic replicon. We found that, in addition to ER markers, early endosome (EE) proteins, including Rab5, were associated with web-inducing protein NS4B. Furthermore, an immunoisolated fraction containing NS4B was found to contain both ER and EE proteins. Using fluorescence microscopy, we showed that wild-type and constitutively active Rab5 proteins were associated with NS4B. Interestingly, expression of dominant-negative Rab5 resulted in significant loss of GFP fluorescence in NS5A-GFP replicon cells. We also found that a small reduction in Rab5 protein expression decreased HCV RNA synthesis significantly. Furthermore, transfection of labeled Rab5 small interfering RNAs into NS5A-GFP replicon cells resulted in a significant decrease in GFP fluorescence. Finally, Rab5 protein was found to coimmunoprecipitate with HCV NS4B. These studies suggest that EE proteins, including Rab5, may play a role in HCV genome replication or web formation."
18160438,Human butyrate-induced transcript 1 interacts with hepatitis C virus NS5A and regulates viral replication.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is required for the replication of the viral genome and is involved in several host signaling pathways. To gain further insight into the functional role of NS5A in HCV replication, we screened human cDNA libraries by a yeast two-hybrid system using NS5A as the bait and identified human butyrate-induced transcript 1 (hB-ind1) as a novel NS5A-binding protein. Endogenously and exogenously expressed hB-ind1 was coimmunoprecipitated with NS5A of various genotypes through the coiled-coil domain of hB-ind1. The small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of hB-ind1 in human hepatoma cell lines suppressed the replication of HCV RNA replicons and the production of infectious particles of HCV genotype 2a strain JFH1. Furthermore, these reductions were canceled by the expression of an siRNA-resistant hB-ind1 mutant. Among the NS5A-binding host proteins involved in HCV replication, hB-ind1 exhibited binding with FKBP8, and hB-ind1 interacted with Hsp90 through the FxxW motif in its N-terminal p23 homology domain. The impairment of the replication of HCV RNA replicons and of the production of infectious particles of JFH1 virus in the hB-ind1 knockdown cell lines was not reversed by the expression of an siRNA-resistant hB-ind1 mutant in which the FxxW motif was replaced by AxxA. These results suggest that hB-ind1 plays a crucial role in HCV RNA replication and the propagation of JFH1 virus through interaction with viral and host proteins."
23542348,Hepatitis C virus NS4B blocks the interaction of STING and TBK1 to evade host innate immunity.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major human viral pathogen that causes chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In most cases, acute HCV infection becomes persistent, at least in part due to viral evasion of host innate immune response. Although HCV genomic RNA contains pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that is able to induce host interferon responses, HCV can shut down the responses by using the viral NS3/4A protease to cleave MAVS/VISA and TRIF, two key adaptor molecules essential for the interferon signaling activation. The aim of this study was to explore a novel NS3/4A-independent mechanism HCV utilizes to evade host innate immune responses."
20162731,Hepatitis C virus core protein interacts with fibrinogen-beta and attenuates cytokine stimulated acute-phase response.,"Fibrinogen-beta (FBG-beta), an important acute-phase protein (APP), is generated by the liver as a target for inflammatory mediators. Here we identified FBG-beta as a hepatitis C virus (HCV) core interacting protein by screening a human liver complementary DNA (cDNA) library using mammalian two-hybrid analysis. An association between FBG-beta and HCV core protein was verified by confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation from the transfected human hepatocyte (Huh-7) cell line. HCV core or genomic RNA transfected Huh-7 cells modestly increased FBG-beta protein expression when compared to the basal level in control hepatocytes. Transfection of HCV core or full-length (FL) gene into Huh-7 cells up-regulated basal FBG-beta promoter activity. Exogenous addition of IL-6 stimulates FBG-beta promoter activity in hepatocytes. However, ectopic expression of HCV core or FL in hepatocytes inhibited IL-6-stimulated FBG-beta promoter activation. Inhibition of endogenous FBG-beta expression following introduction of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells displayed a gain of function of promoter regulation by HCV core protein. Further studies suggested that HCV core gene expression in stable transfectants of Huh-7 cells resulted in a basal up-regulation of FBG-beta and other APPs. However, treatment with cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), or tumor necrosis factor-alpha repressed FBG-beta and other acute-phase response (APR) genes."
12610133,Protein synthesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress can be modulated by the hepatitis C virus envelope protein E2 through the eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha kinase PERK.,"The hepatitis C virus envelope protein, E2, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound protein that contains a region of sequence homology with the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR and its substrate, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2). We previously reported that E2 modulates global translation through inhibition of the interferon-induced antiviral protein PKR through its PKR-eIF2alpha phosphorylation site homology domain (PePHD). Here we show that the PKR-like ER-resident kinase (PERK) binds to and is also inhibited by E2. At low expression levels, E2 induced ER stress, but at high expression levels, and in vitro, E2 inhibited PERK kinase activity. Mammalian cells that stably express E2 were refractory to the translation-inhibitory effects of ER stress inducers, and E2 relieved general translation inhibition induced by PERK. The PePHD of E2 was required for the rescue of translation that was inhibited by activated PERK, similar to our previous findings with PKR. Here we report the inhibition of a second eIF2alpha kinase by E2, and these results are consistent with a pseudosubstrate mechanism of inhibition of eIF2alpha kinases. These findings may also explain how the virus promotes persistent infection by overcoming the cellular ER stress response."
16227268,Human VAP-B is involved in hepatitis C virus replication through interaction with NS5A and NS5B.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein (NS) 5A is a phosphoprotein that associates with various cellular proteins and participates in the replication of the HCV genome. Human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP) subtype A (VAP-A) is known to be a host factor essential for HCV replication by binding to both NS5A and NS5B. To obtain more information on the NS5A protein in HCV replication, we screened human brain and liver libraries by a yeast two-hybrid system using NS5A as bait and identified VAP-B as an NS5A-binding protein. Immunoprecipitation and mutation analyses revealed that VAP-B binds to both NS5A and NS5B in mammalian cells and forms homo- and heterodimers with VAP-A. VAP-A interacts with VAP-B through the transmembrane domain. NS5A interacts with the coiled-coil domain of VAP-B via 70 residues in the N-terminal and 341 to 344 amino acids in the C-terminal polyproline cluster region. NS5A was colocalized with VAP-B in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The specific antibody to VAP-B suppressed HCV RNA replication in a cell-free assay. Overexpression of VAP-B, but not of a mutant lacking its transmembrane domain, enhanced the expression of NS5A and NS5B and the replication of HCV RNA in Huh-7 cells harboring a subgenomic replicon. In the HCV replicon cells, the knockdown of endogenous VAP-B by small interfering RNA decreased expression of NS5B, but not of NS5A. These results suggest that VAP-B, in addition to VAP-A, plays an important role in the replication of the HCV genome."
22640416,The variable N-terminal region of DDX5 contains structural elements and auto-inhibits its interaction with NS5B of hepatitis C virus.,"RNA helicases of the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box family of proteins are involved in many aspects of RNA metabolism from transcription to RNA decay, but most of them have also been shown to be multifunctional. The DEAD-box helicase DDX5 of host cells has been shown to interact with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) of HCV (hepatitis C virus). In the present study, we report the presence of two independent NS5B-binding sites in DDX5, one located at the N-terminus and another at the C-terminus. The N-terminal fragment of DDX5, which consists of the first 305 amino acids and shall be referred as DDX5-N, was expressed and crystallized. The crystal structure shows that domain 1 (residues 79-303) of DDX5 contains the typical features found in the structures of other DEAD-box helicases. DDX5-N also contains the highly variable NTR (N-terminal region) of unknown function and the crystal structure reveals structural elements in part of the NTR, namely residues 52-78. This region forms an extensive loop and an α-helix. From co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the NTR of DDX5-N was observed to auto-inhibit its interaction with NS5B. Interestingly, the α-helix in NTR is essential for this auto-inhibition and seems to mediate the interaction between the highly flexible 1-51 residues in NTR and the NS5B-binding site in DDX5-N. Furthermore, NMR investigations reveal that there is a direct interaction between DDX5 and NS5B in vitro."
20534861,Polo-like kinase 1 is involved in hepatitis C virus replication by hyperphosphorylating NS5A.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication involves many viral and host factors. Here, we employed a lentivirus-based RNA interference (RNAi) screening approach to search for possible cellular factors. By using a kinase-phosphatase RNAi library and an HCV replicon reporter system, we identified a serine-threonine kinase, Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), as a potential host factor regulating HCV replication. Knockdown of Plk1 reduced both HCV RNA replication and nonstructural (NS) protein production in both HCV replicon cells and HCV-infected cells while it did not significantly affect host cellular growth or cell cycle. Overexpression of Plk1 in the knockdown cells rescued HCV replication. Interestingly, the ratio between the hyperphosphorylated form (p58) and the basal phosphorylated form (p56) of NS5A was lower in the Plk1 knockdown cells and Plk1 kinase inhibitor-treated cells than in the control groups. Further studies showed that Plk1 could be immunoprecipitated together with NS5A. Both proteins partially colocalized in the perinuclear region. Furthermore, Plk1 could phosphorylate NS5A to both the p58 and p56 forms in an in vitro assay system; the phosphorylation efficiency was comparable to that of the reported casein kinase. Taken together, this study shows that Plk1 is an NS5A phosphokinase and thereby indirectly regulates HCV RNA replication. Because of the differential effects of Plk1 on HCV replication and host cell growth, Plk1 could potentially serve as a target for anti-HCV therapy."
24009510,Signal peptidase complex subunit 1 participates in the assembly of hepatitis C virus through an interaction with E2 and NS2.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) is a hydrophobic, transmembrane protein that is required not only for NS2-NS3 cleavage, but also for infectious virus production. To identify cellular factors that interact with NS2 and are important for HCV propagation, we screened a human liver cDNA library by split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid assay using full-length NS2 as a bait, and identified signal peptidase complex subunit 1 (SPCS1), which is a component of the microsomal signal peptidase complex. Silencing of endogenous SPCS1 resulted in markedly reduced production of infectious HCV, whereas neither processing of structural proteins, cell entry, RNA replication, nor release of virus from the cells was impaired. Propagation of Japanese encephalitis virus was not affected by knockdown of SPCS1, suggesting that SPCS1 does not widely modulate the viral lifecycles of the Flaviviridae family. SPCS1 was found to interact with both NS2 and E2. A complex of NS2, E2, and SPCS1 was formed in cells as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Knockdown of SPCS1 impaired interaction of NS2 with E2. Our findings suggest that SPCS1 plays a key role in the formation of the membrane-associated NS2-E2 complex via its interaction with NS2 and E2, which leads to a coordinating interaction between the structural and non-structural proteins and facilitates the early step of assembly of infectious particles."
19264780,Involvement of creatine kinase B in hepatitis C virus genome replication through interaction with the viral NS4A protein.,"Persistent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver diseases. The aim of this study was to identify host cell factor(s) participating in the HCV replication complex (RC) and to clarify the regulatory mechanisms of viral genome replication dependent on the host-derived factor(s) identified. By comparative proteome analysis of RC-rich membrane fractions and subsequent gene silencing mediated by RNA interference, we identified several candidates for RC components involved in HCV replication. We found that one of these candidates, creatine kinase B (CKB), a key ATP-generating enzyme that regulates ATP in subcellular compartments of nonmuscle cells, is important for efficient replication of the HCV genome and propagation of infectious virus. CKB interacts with HCV NS4A protein and forms a complex with NS3-4A, which possesses multiple enzyme activities. CKB upregulates both NS3-4A-mediated unwinding of RNA and DNA in vitro and replicase activity in permeabilized HCV replicating cells. Our results support a model in which recruitment of CKB to the HCV RC compartment, which has high and fluctuating energy demands, through its interaction with NS4A is important for efficient replication of the viral genome. The CKB-NS4A association is a potential target for the development of a new type of antiviral therapeutic strategy."
12595532,The hepatitis C virus NS2 protein is an inhibitor of CIDE-B-induced apoptosis.,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection frequently leads to liver cancer. To determine the viral factor(s) potentially involved in viral persistence, we focused our work on NS2, a viral protein of unknown function. To assign a role for NS2, we searched for cellular proteins that interact with NS2. Performing a two-hybrid screen on a human liver cDNA library, we found that NS2 interacted with the liver-specific pro-apoptotic CIDE-B protein. Binding specificity of NS2 for CIDE-B was confirmed by cell-free assays associated with colocalization studies and coprecipitation experiments on human endogenous CIDE-B. CIDE-B, a member of the novel CIDE family of apoptosis-inducing factors, has been reported to show strong cell death-inducing activity in its C-terminal domain. We show that this CIDE-B killing domain is involved in the NS2 interaction. NS2 binding was sufficient to inhibit CIDE-B-induced apoptosis because an NS2 deletion mutant unable to interact with CIDE-B in vitro lost its capacity to interfere with CIDE-B cell death activity. Although it has been reported that CIDE-B-induced apoptosis is characterized by mitochondrial localization, the precise apoptotic mechanism remained unknown. Here, we show that CIDE-B induced cell death in a caspase-dependent manner through cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that NS2 counteracted the cytochrome c release induced by CIDE-B. In vivo, the CIDE-B protein level was extremely low in adenovirus-infected transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein compared with that in wild-type mice. We suggest that NS2 interferes with the CIDE-B-induced death pathway and participates in HCV strategies to subvert host cell defense."
20953506,Network based analysis of hepatitis C virus core and NS4B protein interactions.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Here we attempt to further our understanding of the biological context of protein interactions in HCV pathogenesis, by investigating interactions between HCV proteins Core and NS4B and human host proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) membrane protein system, eleven human host proteins interacting with Core and 45 interacting with NS4B were identified, most of which are novel. These interactions were used to infer overall protein interaction maps linking the viral proteins with components of the host cellular networks. Core and NS4B proteins contribute to highly compact interaction networks that may enable the virus to respond rapidly to host physiological responses to HCV infection. Analysis of the interaction networks highlighted enriched biological pathways likely influenced in HCV infection. Inspection of individual interactions offered further insights into the possible mechanisms that permit HCV to evade the host immune response and appropriate host metabolic machinery. Follow-up cellular assays with cell lines infected with HCV genotype 1b and 2a strains validated Core interacting proteins ENO1 and SLC25A5 and host protein PXN as novel regulators of HCV replication and viral production. ENO1 siRNA knockdown was found to inhibit HCV replication in both the HCV genotypes and viral RNA release in genotype 2a. PXN siRNA inhibition was observed to inhibit replication specifically in genotype 1b but not in genotype 2a, while SLC25A5 siRNA facilitated a minor increase in the viral RNA release in genotype 2a. Thus, our analysis can provide potential targets for more effective anti-HCV therapeutic intervention."
10400713,"Characterization of hepatitis C virus E2 glycoprotein interaction with a putative cellular receptor, CD81.","A truncated soluble form of the hepatitis C virus E2 glycoprotein, E2661, binds specifically to the surface of cells expressing human CD81 (hCD81) but not other members of the tetraspanin family (CD9, CD63, and CD151). No differences were noted between the level of E2661 binding to hCD81 expressed on the surface of rat RBL or KM3 cells compared to Daudi and Molt-4 cells, suggesting that additional human-cell-specific factors are not required for the primary interaction of E2 with the cell surface. E2 did not interact with African green monkey (AGM) CD81 on the surface of COS cells, which differs from the hCD81 sequence at four residues within the second extracellular region (EC2) (amino acids [aa] 163, 186, 188, and 196), suggesting that one or more of these residues defines the site of interaction with E2. Various recombinant forms of CD81 EC2 show differences in the ability to bind E2, suggesting that CD81 conformation is important for E2 recognition. Regions of E2 involved in the CD81 interaction were analyzed, and our data suggest that the binding site is of a conformational nature involving aa 480 to 493 and 544 to 551 within the E2 glycoprotein. Finally, we demonstrate that ligation of CD81 by E2661 induced aggregation of lymphoid cells and inhibited B-cell proliferation, demonstrating that E2 interaction with CD81 can modulate cell function."
19088272,CD81 is dispensable for hepatitis C virus cell-to-cell transmission in hepatoma cells.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects cells by the direct uptake of cell-free virus following virus engagement with specific cell receptors such as CD81. Recent data have shown that HCV is also capable of direct cell-to-cell transmission, although the role of CD81 in this process is disputed. Here, we generated cell culture infectious strain JFH1 HCV (HCVcc) genomes carrying an alanine substitution of E2 residues W529 or D535 that are critical for binding to CD81 and infectivity. Co-cultivation of these cells with naïve cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) resulted in a small number of cells co-expressing both EGFP and HCV NS5A, showing that the HCVcc mutants are capable of cell-to-cell spread. In contrast, no cell-to-cell transmission from JFH1(DeltaE1E2)-transfected cells occurred, indicating that the HCV glycoproteins are essential for this process. The frequency of cell-to-cell transmission of JFH1(W529A) was unaffected by the presence of neutralizing antibodies that inhibit E2-CD81 interactions. By using cell lines that expressed little or no CD81 and that were refractive to infection with cell-free virus, we showed that the occurrence of viral cell-to-cell transmission is not influenced by the levels of CD81 on either donor or recipient cells. Thus, our results show that CD81 plays no role in the cell-to-cell spread of HCVcc and that this mode of transmission is shielded from neutralizing antibodies. These data suggest that therapeutic interventions targeting the entry of cell-free HCV may not be sufficient in controlling an ongoing chronic infection, but need to be complemented by additional strategies aimed at disrupting direct cell-to-cell viral transmission."
23219818,PML tumor suppressor protein is required for HCV production.,"PML tumor suppressor protein, which forms discrete nuclear structures termed PML-nuclear bodies, has been associated with several cellular functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis and antiviral defense. Recently, it was reported that the HCV core protein colocalizes with PML in PML-NBs and abrogates the PML function through interaction with PML. However, role(s) of PML in HCV life cycle is unknown. To test whether or not PML affects HCV life cycle, we examined the level of secreted HCV core and the infectivity of HCV in the culture supernatants as well as the level of HCV RNA in HuH-7-derived RSc cells, in which HCV-JFH1 can infect and efficiently replicate, stably expressing short hairpin RNA targeted to PML. In this context, the level of secreted HCV core and the infectivity in the supernatants from PML knockdown cells was remarkably reduced, whereas the level of HCV RNA in the PML knockdown cells was not significantly affected in spite of very effective knockdown of PML. In fact, we showed that PML is unrelated to HCV RNA replication using the subgenomic HCV-JFH1 replicon RNA, JRN/3-5B. Furthermore, the infectivity of HCV-like particle in the culture supernatants was significantly reduced in PML knockdown JRN/3-5B cells expressing core to NS2 coding region of HCV-JFH1 genome using the trans-packaging system. Finally, we also demonstrated that INI1 and DDX5, the PML-related proteins, are involved in HCV production. Taken together, these findings suggest that PML is required for HCV production."
15521019,Hepatitis C core and nonstructural 3 proteins trigger toll-like receptor 2-mediated pathways and inflammatory activation.,Recent evidence suggests that toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize certain viruses. We reported that hepatitis C virus (HCV) core and nonstructural 3 (NS3) proteins activate inflammatory pathways in monocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TLRs in innate immune cell activation by core and NS3 proteins.
16996479,Subproteomic study of hepatitis C virus replicon reveals Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 as potential HCV RC component.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA synthesis takes place on a detergent resistant membrane (DRM) structure. To identify potential cellular proteins related to HCV replication complexes (RC), we purified DRMs from HCV subgenomic replicon cells and its parental Huh7 cells. The proteins of DRM fractions were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry. Comparing with parental Huh7 cells, 60 proteins were up-regulated while 14 proteins were down-regulated in HCV replicon cells. Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1), one of the elevated proteins, was found to be associated with HCV NS5B and knockdown of G3BP1 by siRNA in HCV replicon cells significantly reduced HCV replication, which may indicate it a potential component of HCV RC. These results suggest that HCV viral gene and proteins may regulate the presence of host cellular proteins in DRM, ensure appropriate concentrations of replication components, and hence control the rates or efficiencies of HCV replication."
17855521,DDX3 DEAD-box RNA helicase is required for hepatitis C virus RNA replication.,"DDX3, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, binds to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein. However, the role(s) of DDX3 in HCV replication is still not understood. Here we demonstrate that the accumulation of both genome-length HCV RNA (HCV-O, genotype 1b) and its replicon RNA were significantly suppressed in HuH-7-derived cells expressing short hairpin RNA targeted to DDX3 by lentivirus vector transduction. As well, RNA replication of JFH1 (genotype 2a) and release of the core into the culture supernatants were suppressed in DDX3 knockdown cells after inoculation of the cell culture-generated HCVcc. Thus, DDX3 is required for HCV RNA replication."
21559518,Cyclosporin A associated helicase-like protein facilitates the association of hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase with its cellular cyclophilin B.,"Cyclosporin A (CsA) is well known as an immunosuppressive drug useful for allogeneic transplantation. It has been reported that CsA inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome replication, which indicates that cellular targets of CsA regulate the viral replication. However, the regulation mechanisms of HCV replication governed by CsA target proteins have not been fully understood."
18667510,The DNA damage sensors ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase and checkpoint kinase 2 are required for hepatitis C virus RNA replication.,"Cellular responses to DNA damage are crucial for maintaining genome integrity, virus infection, and preventing the development of cancer. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and the expression of the HCV nonstructural protein NS3 and core protein have been proposed as factors involved in the induction of double-stranded DNA breaks and enhancement of the mutation frequency of cellular genes. Since DNA damage sensors, such as the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), ATM- and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), and checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), play central roles in the response to genotoxic stress, we hypothesized that these sensors might affect HCV replication. To test this hypothesis, we examined the level of HCV RNA in HuH-7-derived cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA targeted to ATM, ATR, PARP-1, or Chk2. Consequently, we found that replication of both genome-length HCV RNA (HCV-O, genotype 1b) and the subgenomic replicon RNA were notably suppressed in ATM- or Chk2-knockdown cells. In addition, the RNA replication of HCV-JFH1 (genotype 2a) and the release of core protein into the culture supernatants were suppressed in these knockdown cells after inoculation of the cell culture-generated HCV. Consistent with these observations, ATM kinase inhibitor could suppress the HCV RNA replication. Furthermore, we observed that HCV NS3-NS4A interacted with ATM and that HCV NS5B interacted with both ATM and Chk2. Taken together, these results suggest that the ATM signaling pathway is critical for HCV RNA replication and may represent a novel target for the clinical treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C."
16203724,Hepatitis C virus nonstructural proteins inhibit apolipoprotein B100 secretion.,"Host genes involved in lipid metabolism are differentially regulated during the early stages of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The majority of lipids synthesized in the liver are exported to other tissues in the form of lipoproteins. The formation of these lipoproteins is dependent upon the association of triglycerides with apolipoprotein B100. Using the HCV subgenomic replicon expression system, we show that secretion of apoB100 is significantly reduced. Inhibition of apoB100 degradation by ALLN did not improve secretion. Triglyceride levels as well as microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mRNA and activity levels were reduced in replicon-expressing cells, indicating potential reasons for the observed decrease. Further evidence is presented for the interaction between the HCV nonstructural protein 5A and apoB100. These results provide further insight into the alteration of lipid metabolism by HCV."
15825084,Hepatitis C virus expression suppresses interferon signaling by degrading STAT1.,"The molecular mechanisms by which hepatitis C virus (HCV) antagonizes the antiviral actions of interferon (IFN) have not been fully characterized. Specifically, how HCV proteins impact on IFN signaling components has yet to be elucidated. We used an HCV cell-based expression model to examine the interaction between HCV protein expression and host type I IFN signaling components in the Jak-STAT kinase pathway."
17229681,"An RNA-binding protein, hnRNP A1, and a scaffold protein, septin 6, facilitate hepatitis C virus replication.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. NS5b is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that polymerizes the newly synthesized RNA. HCV likely uses host proteins for its replication, similar to other RNA viruses. To identify the cellular factors involved in HCV replication, we searched for cellular proteins that interact with the NS5b protein. HnRNP A1 and septin 6 proteins were identified by coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid screening, respectively. Interestingly, septin 6 protein also interacts with hnRNP A1. Moreover, hnRNP A1 interacts with the 5'-nontranslated region (5' NTR) and the 3' NTR of HCV RNA containing the cis-acting elements required for replication. Knockdown of hnRNP A1 and overexpression of C-terminally truncated hnRNP A1 reduced HCV replication. In addition, knockdown of septin 6 and overexpression of N-terminally truncated septin 6 inhibited HCV replication. These results indicate that the host proteins hnRNP A1 and septin 6 play important roles in the replication of HCV through RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions."
23857585,Hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibits mixed lineage kinase 3 to block apoptosis.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection results in the activation of numerous stress responses including oxidative stress, with the potential to induce an apoptotic state. Previously we have shown that HCV attenuates the stress-induced, p38MAPK-mediated up-regulation of the K(+) channel Kv2.1, to maintain the survival of infected cells in the face of cellular stress. We demonstrated that this effect was mediated by HCV non-structural 5A (NS5A) protein, which impaired p38MAPK activity through a polyproline motif-dependent interaction, resulting in reduction of phosphorylation activation of Kv2.1. In this study, we investigated the host cell proteins targeted by NS5A to mediate Kv2.1 inhibition. We screened a phage-display library expressing the entire complement of human SH3 domains for novel NS5A-host cell interactions. This analysis identified mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) as a putative NS5A interacting partner. MLK3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a member of the MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) family and activates p38MAPK. An NS5A-MLK3 interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. We further demonstrate a novel role of MLK3 in the modulation of Kv2.1 activity, whereby MLK3 overexpression leads to the up-regulation of channel activity. Accordingly, coexpression of NS5A suppressed this stimulation. Additionally we demonstrate that overexpression of MLK3 induced apoptosis, which was also counteracted by NS5A. We conclude that NS5A targets MLK3 with multiple downstream consequences for both apoptosis and K(+) homeostasis."
22301157,Annexin A2 is involved in the formation of hepatitis C virus replication complex on the lipid raft.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replicates in hepatic cells by forming a replication complex on the lipid raft (detergent-resistant membrane [DRM]). Replication complex formation requires various viral nonstructural (NS) proteins as well as host cellular proteins. In our previous study (C. K. Lai, K. S. Jeng, K. Machida, and M. M. Lai, J. Virol. 82:8838-8848, 2008), we found that a cellular protein, annexin A2 (Anxa2), interacts with NS3/NS4A. Since NS3/NS4A is a membranous protein and Anxa2 is known as a lipid raft-associated scaffold protein, we postulate that Anxa2 helps in the formation of the HCV replication complex on the lipid raft. Further studies showed that Anxa2 was localized at the HCV-induced membranous web and interacted with NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B and colocalized with them in the perinuclear region. The silencing of Anxa2 decreased the formation of membranous web-like structures and viral RNA replication. Subcellular fractionation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis revealed that Anxa2 was partially associated with HCV at the lipid raft enriched with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) and caveolin-2. Further, the overexpression of Anxa2 in HCV-nonsusceptible HEK293 cells caused the enrichment of HCV NS proteins in the DRM fraction and increased the colony-forming ability of the HCV replicon. Since Anxa2 is known to induce the formation of the lipid raft microdomain, we propose that Anxa2 recruits HCV NS proteins and enriches them on the lipid raft to form the HCV replication complex."
11915042,Interaction of hepatitis C virus core protein with retinoid X receptor alpha modulates its transcriptional activity.,"Hepatic steatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are common and serious features of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and the core protein has been shown to play distinct roles in the pathogenesis. Here we report the direct interaction of HCV core protein with retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), a transcriptional regulator that controls many aspects of cell proliferation, differentiation, and lipid metabolism. The core protein binds to the DNA-binding domain of RXRalpha, leading to increase the DNA binding of RXRalpha to its responsive element. In addition, RXRalpha is activated in cells expressing the core protein as well as in the livers of the core-transgenic mice that would develop hepatic steatosis and HCC later in their lives. Using promoter genes of cellular retinol binding protein II (CRBPII) and acyl-CoA oxidase as reporters, we also show that the expression of the core protein enhances the transcriptional activity regulated by the RXRalpha homodimer as well as by the heterodimer with peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha. Furthermore, expression of the CRBPII gene is also up-regulated in the livers of HCV core-transgenic mice. In conclusion, these results suggest that modulation of RXRalpha-controlled gene expression via interaction with the core protein contributes to the pathogenesis of HCV infection."
23986595,A host YB-1 ribonucleoprotein complex is hijacked by hepatitis C virus for the control of NS3-dependent particle production.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) orchestrates the different stages of its life cycle in time and space through the sequential participation of HCV proteins and cellular machineries; hence, these represent tractable molecular host targets for HCV elimination by combination therapies. We recently identified multifunctional Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1 or YBX1) as an interacting partner of NS3/4A protein and HCV genomic RNA that negatively regulates the equilibrium between viral translation/replication and particle production. To identify novel host factors that regulate the production of infectious particles, we elucidated the YB-1 interactome in human hepatoma cells by a quantitative mass spectrometry approach. We identified 71 YB-1-associated proteins that included previously reported HCV regulators DDX3, heterogeneous nuclear RNP A1, and ILF2. Of the potential YB-1 interactors, 26 proteins significantly modulated HCV replication in a gene-silencing screening. Following extensive interaction and functional validation, we identified three YB-1 partners, C1QBP, LARP-1, and IGF2BP2, that redistribute to the surface of core-containing lipid droplets in HCV JFH-1-expressing cells, similarly to YB-1 and DDX6. Importantly, knockdown of these proteins stimulated the release and/or egress of HCV particles without affecting virus assembly, suggesting a functional YB-1 protein complex that negatively regulates virus production. Furthermore, a JFH-1 strain with the NS3 Q221L mutation, which promotes virus production, was less sensitive to this negative regulation, suggesting that this HCV-specific YB-1 protein complex modulates an NS3-dependent step in virus production. Overall, our data support a model in which HCV hijacks host cell machinery containing numerous RNA-binding proteins to control the equilibrium between viral RNA replication and NS3-dependent late steps in particle production."
21835792,Rab5 and class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase Vps34 are involved in hepatitis C virus NS4B-induced autophagy.,"Autophagy has been shown to facilitate replication or production of hepatitis C virus (HCV); nevertheless, how HCV induces autophagy remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HCV nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) alone can induce autophagy signaling; amino acid residues 1 to 190 of NS4B are sufficient for this induction. Further studies showed that the phosphorylation levels of S6K and 4E-BP1 were not altered, suggesting that the mTOR/S6 kinase pathway and mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway did not contribute to NS4B- or HCV-induced autophagy. Inhibition of Rab5 function by silencing Rab5 or overexpressing dominant-negative Rab5 mutant (S34N) resulted in significant reduction of NS4B- or HCV-induced autophagic vesicle formation. Moreover, the autophagy induction was impaired by inhibition of class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) Vps34 function. Finally, the coimmunoprecipitation assay indicated that NS4B formed a complex with Rab5 and Vps34, supporting the notion that Rab5 and Vps34 are involved in NS4B-induced autophagy. Taken together, these results not only reveal a novel role of NS4B in autophagy but also offer a clue to the mechanism of HCV-induced autophagy."
17567694,Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A modulates the toll-like receptor-MyD88-dependent signaling pathway in macrophage cell lines.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces a wide range of chronic liver injuries; however, the mechanism through which HCV evades the immune surveillance system remains obscure. Blood dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in the recognition of viral infection and the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses. Several reports suggest that HCV infection induces the dysfunction of DCs in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Toll-like receptor (TLR) has been shown to play various roles in many viral infections; however, the involvement of HCV proteins in the TLR signaling pathway has not yet been precisely elucidated. In this study, we established mouse macrophage cell lines stably expressing HCV proteins and determined the effect of HCV proteins on the TLR signaling pathways. Immune cells expressing NS3, NS3/4A, NS4B, or NS5A were found to inhibit the activation of the TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 signaling pathways. Various genotypes of NS5A bound to MyD88, a major adaptor molecule in TLR, inhibited the recruitment of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 to MyD88, and impaired cytokine production in response to TLR ligands. Amino acid residues 240 to 280, previously identified as the interferon sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) in NS5A, interacted with the death domain of MyD88, and the expression of a mutant NS5A lacking the ISDR partially restored cytokine production. These results suggest that the expression of HCV proteins modulates the TLR signaling pathway in immune cells."
19150985,Heat-shock protein 90 is essential for stabilization of the hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein NS3.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease. Here, we report a new and effective strategy for inhibiting HCV replication using 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG), an inhibitor of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone with a key role in stabilizing the conformation of many oncogenic signaling proteins. We examined the inhibitory effects of 17-AAG on HCV replication in an HCV replicon cell culture system. In HCV replicon cells treated with 17-AAG, we found that HCV RNA replication was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner, and interestingly, the only HCV protein degraded in these cells was NS3 (nonstructural protein 3). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that NS3 directly interacted with Hsp90, as did proteins expressed from DeltaNS3 protease expression vectors. These results suggest that the suppression of HCV RNA replication is due to the destabilization of NS3 in disruption of the Hsp90 chaperone complex by 17-AAG."
18325616,HCV core protein interacts with Dicer to antagonize RNA silencing.,"RNA silencing is a form of nucleic acid-based immunity against viruses in plants and invertebrate animals. Successful viral infection requires evasion or suppression of gene silencing. Here, we report that the core protein of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) acts as a potent suppressor of RNA silencing (SRS). We have found that the HCV core protein inhibits RNA silencing induced by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) but not by synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in various mammalian cells. We have further demonstrated that HCV core protein directly interacts with Dicer, an RNase enzyme that generates siRNA in host cells. The HCV core protein has been shown to inhibit the function of Dicer to process double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) into siRNAs. Through deletion analysis, we have found that the N-terminal domain is required for core protein to antagonize RNA silencing activity of Dicer enzyme. Thus, our results suggest that HCV core protein may abrogate host cell RNA silencing defense by suppressing the ability of Dicer to process precursor dsRNAs into siRNAs. This anti-Dicer ability of core protein may contribute to the persistent viral infection and pathogenesis of HCV."
19515777,Human VAP-C negatively regulates hepatitis C virus propagation.,"Human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP) subtype A (VAP-A) and subtype B (VAP-B) are involved in the regulation of membrane trafficking, lipid transport and metabolism, and the unfolded protein response. VAP-A and VAP-B consist of the major sperm protein (MSP) domain, the coiled-coil motif, and the C-terminal transmembrane anchor and form homo- and heterodimers through the transmembrane domain. VAP-A and VAP-B interact with NS5B and NS5A of hepatitis C virus (HCV) through the MSP domain and the coiled-coil motif, respectively, and participate in the replication of HCV. VAP-C is a splicing variant of VAP-B consisting of the N-terminal half of the MSP domain of VAP-B followed by the subtype-specific frameshift sequences, and its biological function has not been well characterized. In this study, we have examined the biological functions of VAP-C in the propagation of HCV. VAP-C interacted with NS5B but not with VAP-A, VAP-B, or NS5A in immunoprecipitation analyses, and the expression of VAP-C inhibited the interaction of NS5B with VAP-A or VAP-B. Overexpression of VAP-C impaired the RNA replication of the HCV replicon and the propagation of the HCV JFH1 strain, whereas overexpression of VAP-A and VAP-B enhanced the replication. Furthermore, the expression of VAP-C was observed in various tissues, whereas it was barely detected in the liver. These results suggest that VAP-C acts as a negative regulator of HCV propagation and that the expression of VAP-C may participate in the determination of tissue tropism of HCV propagation."
17686842,A Rab-GAP TBC domain protein binds hepatitis C virus NS5A and mediates viral replication.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important cause of liver disease worldwide. Current therapies are inadequate for most patients. Using a two-hybrid screen, we isolated a novel cellular binding partner interacting with the N terminus of HCV nonstructural protein NS5A. This partner contains a TBC Rab-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) homology domain found in all known Rab-activating proteins. As the first described interaction between such a Rab-GAP and a viral protein, this finding suggests a new mechanism whereby viruses may subvert host cell machinery for mediating the endocytosis, trafficking, and sorting of their own proteins. Moreover, depleting the expression of this partner severely impairs HCV RNA replication with no obvious effect on cell viability. These results suggest that pharmacologic disruption of this NS5A-interacting partner can be contemplated as a potential new antiviral strategy against a pathogen affecting nearly 3% of the world's population."
24263861,HCV NS3 protease enhances liver fibrosis via binding to and activating TGF-β type I receptor.,"Viruses sometimes mimic host proteins and hijack the host cell machinery. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes liver fibrosis, a process largely mediated by the overexpression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and collagen, although the precise underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we report that HCV non-structural protein 3 (NS3) protease affects the antigenicity and bioactivity of TGF-β2 in (CAGA)9-Luc CCL64 cells and in human hepatic cell lines via binding to TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α facilitates this mechanism by increasing the colocalization of TβRI with NS3 protease on the surface of HCV-infected cells. An anti-NS3 antibody against computationally predicted binding sites for TβRI blocked the TGF-β mimetic activities of NS3 in vitro and attenuated liver fibrosis in HCV-infected chimeric mice. These data suggest that HCV NS3 protease mimics TGF-β2 and functions, at least in part, via directly binding to and activating TβRI, thereby enhancing liver fibrosis."
24069433,Inhibition of HCV replication by oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 4 (ORP4) through interaction with HCV NS5B and alteration of lipid droplet formation.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication involves complex interactions among the 3'x RNA element within the HCV 3' untranslated region, viral and host proteins. However, many of the host proteins remain unknown. In this study, we devised an RNA affinity chromatography /2D/MASS proteomics strategy and identified nine putative 3' X-associated host proteins; among them is oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 4 (ORP4), a cytoplasmic receptor for oxysterols. We determined the relationship between ORP4 expression and HCV replication. A very low level of constitutive ORP4 expression was detected in hepatocytes. Ectopically expressed ORP4 was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum and inhibited luciferase reporter gene expression in HCV subgenomic replicon cells and HCV core expression in JFH-1-infected cells. Expression of ORP4S, an ORP4 variant that lacked the N-terminal pleckstrin-homology domain but contained the C-terminal oxysterol-binding domain also inhibited HCV replication, pointing to an important role of the oxysterol-binding domain in ORP4-mediated inhibition of HCV replication. ORP4 was found to associate with HCV NS5B and its expression led to inhibition of the NS5B activity. ORP4 expression had little effect on intracellular lipid synthesis and secretion, but it induced lipid droplet formation in the context of HCV replication. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ORP4 is a negative regulator of HCV replication, likely via interaction with HCV NS5B in the replication complex and regulation of intracellular lipid homeostasis. This work supports the important role of lipids and their metabolism in HCV replication and pathogenesis."
23096996,Hepatitis C virus NS2 protease inhibits host cell antiviral response by inhibiting IKKε and TBK1 functions.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes for several proteins that can interfere with host cell signaling and antiviral response. Previously, serine protease NS3/4A was shown to block host cell interferon (IFN) production by proteolytic cleavage of MAVS and TRIF, the adaptor molecules of the RIG-I and TLR3 signaling pathways, respectively. This study shows that another HCV protease, NS2 can interfere efficiently with cytokine gene expression. NS2 and its proteolytically inactive mutant forms were able to inhibit type I and type III IFN, CCL5 and CXCL10 gene promoters activated by Sendai virus infection. However, the CXCL8 gene promoter was not inhibited by NS2. In addition, constitutively active RIG-I (ΔRIG-I), MAVS, TRIF, IKKε, and TBK1-induced activation of IFN-β promoter was inhibited by NS2. Cotransfection experiments with IKKε or TBK1 together with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and HCV expression constructs revealed that NS2 in a dose-dependent manner inhibited IKKε and especially TBK1-induced IRF3 phosphorylation. GST pull-down experiments with GST-NS2 and in vitro-translated and cell-expressed IKKε and TBK1 demonstrated direct physical interactions of the kinases with NS2. Further evidence that the IKKε/TBK1 kinase complex is the target for NS2 was obtained from the observation that the constitutively active form of IRF3 (IRF3-5D) activated readily IFN-β promoter in the presence of NS2. The present study identified HCV NS2 as a potent interferon antagonist, and describes an explanation of how NS2 downregulates the major signaling pathways involved in the development of host innate antiviral responses."
22911572,Hepatitis C virus NS4B protein targets STING and abrogates RIG-I-mediated type I interferon-dependent innate immunity.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection blocks cellular interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral signaling through cleavage of Cardif by HCV-NS3/4A serine protease. Like NS3/4A, NS4B protein strongly blocks IFN-β production signaling mediated by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Recently, the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) was identified as an activator of RIG-I signaling. STING possesses a structural homology domain with flaviviral NS4B, which suggests a direct protein-protein interaction. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which NS4B targets RIG-I-induced and STING-mediated IFN-β production signaling. IFN-β promoter reporter assay showed that IFN-β promoter activation induced by RIG-I or Cardif was significantly suppressed by both NS4B and NS3/4A, whereas STING-induced IFN-β activation was suppressed by NS4B but not by NS3/4A, suggesting that NS4B had a distinct point of interaction. Immunostaining showed that STING colocalized with NS4B in the endoplasmic reticulum. Immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays demonstrated that NS4B specifically bound STING. Intriguingly, NS4B expression blocked the protein interaction between STING and Cardif, which is required for robust IFN-β activation. NS4B truncation assays showed that its N terminus, containing the STING homology domain, was necessary for the suppression of IFN-β promoter activation. NS4B suppressed residual IFN-β activation by an NS3/4A-cleaved Cardif (Cardif1-508), suggesting that NS3/4A and NS4B may cooperate in the blockade of IFN-β production."
22939626,Structurally distinct bacterial TBC-like GAPs link Arf GTPase to Rab1 inactivation to counteract host defenses.,"Rab GTPases are frequent targets of vacuole-living bacterial pathogens for appropriate trafficking of the vacuole. Here we discover that bacterial effectors including VirA from nonvacuole Shigella flexneri and EspG from extracellular Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) harbor TBC-like dual-finger motifs and exhibits potent RabGAP activities. Specific inactivation of Rab1 by VirA/EspG disrupts ER-to-Golgi trafficking. S. flexneri intracellular persistence requires VirA TBC-like GAP activity that mediates bacterial escape from autophagy-mediated host defense. Rab1 inactivation by EspG severely blocks host secretory pathway, resulting in inhibited interleukin-8 secretion from infected cells. Crystal structures of VirA/EspG-Rab1-GDP-aluminum fluoride complexes highlight TBC-like catalytic role for the arginine and glutamine finger residues and reveal a 3D architecture distinct from that of the TBC domain. Structure of Arf6-EspG-Rab1 ternary complex illustrates a pathogenic signaling complex that rewires host Arf signaling to Rab1 inactivation. Structural distinctions of VirA/EspG further predict a possible extensive presence of TBC-like RabGAP effectors in counteracting various host defenses."
24136289,Identification and comparative analysis of hepatitis C virus-host cell protein interactions.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) alters the global behavior of the host cell to create an environment conducive to its own replication, but much remains unknown about how HCV proteins elicit these changes. Thus, a better understanding of the interface between the virus and host cell is required. Here we report the results of a large-scale yeast two-hybrid screen to identify protein-protein interactions between HCV genotype 2a (strain JFH1) and cellular factors. Our study identified 112 unique interactions between 7 HCV and 94 human proteins, over 40% of which have been linked to HCV infection by other studies. These interactions develop a more complete picture of HCV infection, providing insight into HCV manipulation of pathways, such as lipid and cholesterol metabolism, that were previously linked to HCV infection and implicating novel targets within microtubule-organizing centers, the complement system and cell cycle regulatory machinery. In an effort to understand the relationship between HCV and related viruses, we compared the HCV 2a interactome to those of other HCV genotypes and to the related dengue virus. Greater overlap was observed between HCV and dengue virus targets than between HCV genotypes, demonstrating the value of parallel screening approaches when comparing virus-host cell interactomes. Using siRNAs to inhibit expression of cellular proteins, we found that five of the ten shared targets tested (CUL7, PCM1, RILPL2, RNASET2, and TCF7L2) were required for replication of both HCV and dengue virus. These shared interactions provide insight into common features of the viral life cycles of the family Flaviviridae."
12356718,The human scavenger receptor class B type I is a novel candidate receptor for the hepatitis C virus.,"We discovered that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope glycoprotein E2 binds to human hepatoma cell lines independently of the previously proposed HCV receptor CD81. Comparative binding studies using recombinant E2 from the most prevalent 1a and 1b genotypes revealed that E2 recognition by hepatoma cells is independent from the viral isolate, while E2-CD81 interaction is isolate specific. Binding of soluble E2 to human hepatoma cells was impaired by deletion of the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1), but the wild-type phenotype was recovered by introducing a compensatory mutation reported previously to rescue infectivity of an HVR1-deleted HCV infectious clone. We have identified the receptor responsible for E2 binding to human hepatic cells as the human scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). E2-SR-BI interaction is very selective since neither mouse SR-BI nor the closely related human scavenger receptor CD36, were able to bind E2. Finally, E2 recognition by SR-BI was competed out in an isolate-specific manner both on the hepatoma cell line and on the human SR-BI-transfected cell line by an anti-HVR1 monoclonal antibody."
9794763,Binding of hepatitis C virus to CD81.,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection occurs in about 3 percent of the world's population and is a major cause of liver disease. HCV infection is also associated with cryoglobulinemia, a B lymphocyte proliferative disorder. Virus tropism is controversial, and the mechanisms of cell entry remain unknown. The HCV envelope protein E2 binds human CD81, a tetraspanin expressed on various cell types including hepatocytes and B lymphocytes. Binding of E2 was mapped to the major extracellular loop of CD81. Recombinant molecules containing this loop bound HCV and antibodies that neutralize HCV infection in vivo inhibited virus binding to CD81 in vitro."
12609975,DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are high affinity binding receptors for hepatitis C virus glycoprotein E2.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome codes for highly mannosylated envelope proteins, which are naturally retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. We found that the HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 binds the dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and the related liver endothelial cell lectin L-SIGN through high-mannose N-glycans. Competing ligands such as mannan and an antibody directed against the carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) abrogated binding. While no E2 interaction with distant monomeric CRDs on biosensor chips could be detected, binding is observed if CRDs are closely seeded (Kd = 48 nm) and if the CRD is part of the oligomeric-soluble extracellular domain of DC-SIGN (Kd = 30 nm). The highest affinity is seen for plasma membrane-expressed DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (Kd = 3 and 6 nm, respectively). These results indicate that several high-mannose N-glycans in a structurally defined cluster on E2 bind to several subunits of the oligomeric lectin CRD. High affinity interaction of viral glycoproteins with oligomeric lectins might represent a strategy by which HCV targets to and concentrates in the liver and infects dendritic cells."
23152499,Hepatitis C virus NS5B and host cyclophilin A share a common binding site on NS5A.,"Nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) is essential for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication as it carries the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymatic activity. HCV replication occurs in a membrane-associated multiprotein complex in which HCV NS5A and host cyclophilin A (CypA) have been shown to be present together with the viral polymerase. We used NMR spectroscopy to perform a per residue level characterization of the molecular interactions between the unfolded domains 2 and 3 of NS5A (NS5A-D2 and NS5A-D3), CypA, and NS5B(Δ21). We show that three regions of NS5A-D2 (residues 250-262 (region A), 274-287 (region B), and 306-333 (region C)) interact with NS5B(Δ21), whereas NS5A-D3 does not. We show that both NS5B(Δ21) and CypA share a common binding site on NS5A that contains residues Pro-306 to Glu-323. No direct molecular interaction has been detected by NMR spectroscopy between HCV NS5B(Δ21) and host CypA. We show that cyclosporine A added to a sample containing NS5B(Δ21), NS5A-D2, and CypA specifically inhibits the interaction between CypA and NS5A-D2 without altering the one between NS5A-D2 and NS5B(Δ21). A high quality heteronuclear NMR spectrum of HCV NS5B(Δ21) has been obtained and was used to characterize the binding site on the polymerase of NS5A-D2. Moreover these data highlight the potential of using NMR of NS5B(Δ21) as a powerful tool to characterize in solution the interactions of the HCV polymerase with all kinds of molecules (proteins, inhibitors, RNA). This work brings new insights into the comprehension of the molecular interplay between NS5B, NS5A, and CypA, three essentials proteins for HCV replication."
10488152,Identification of the major phosphorylation site of the hepatitis C virus H strain NS5A protein as serine 2321.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein is phosphorylated by a cellular, serine/threonine kinase. To identify the major site(s) of NS5A phosphorylation, radiolabeled HCV-H NS5A phosphopeptides were purified and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis and Edman degradation. These data identified the major intracellular phosphorylation site in the HCV-H NS5A protein as Ser(2321), a result verified by two additional, independent methods: (i) substitution of Ala for Ser(2321) and the concomitant disappearance of the major in vivo phosphorylated peptides and corresponding in vitro phosphorylated peptides; and (ii) comigration of the digestion products of a synthetic peptide phosphorylated on Ser(2321) with the major in vivo phosphorylated NS5A peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis of Ser(2321) suggested that phosphorylation of NS5A is dispensable for previously described interactions with NS4A and PKR, a cellular, antiviral kinase that does not appear to catalyze NS5A phosphorylation. The proline-rich nature of the amino acid sequence flanking Ser(2321) (PLPPPRS(2321) PPVPPPR) suggests that a proline-directed kinase is responsible for the majority of HCV NS5A phosphorylation, consistent with previous kinase inhibitor studies."
12604806,Analysis of the subcellular localization of hepatitis C virus E2 glycoprotein in live cells using EGFP fusion proteins.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) E1 and E2 glycoproteins assemble intracellularly to form a non-covalently linked heterodimer, which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To study the subcellular localization of E2 in live cells, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was fused to the N terminus of E2. Using fluorescence and confocal microscopy, we have confirmed that E2 is located in the ER, where budding of HCV virions is thought to occur. Immunoprecipitation experiments using a conformation-sensitive antibody and a GST pull-down assay showed that fusion of EGFP to E2 interferes neither with its heterodimeric assembly with E1, nor with proper folding of the ectodomain, nor with the capacity of E2 to interact with human CD81, indicating that the EGFP-E2 fusion protein is functional. As a tool to study binding of E2 to target cells, we also described the expression of an EGFP-E2 fusion protein at the cell surface."
23907398,"A host cell RNA-binding protein, Staufen1, has a role in hepatitis C virus replication before virus assembly.","Staufen1 is a dsRNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of translation and the trafficking and degradation of cellular RNAs. Staufen1 has also been shown to stimulate translation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA, regulate HIV-1 and influenza A virus assembly, and there is also indication that it can interact with hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA. To investigate the role of Staufen1 in the HCV replication cycle, the effects of small interfering RNA knockout of Staufen1 on HCV strain JFH-1 replication and the intracellular distribution of the Staufen1 protein during HCV infection were examined. Silencing Staufen1 in HCV-infected Huh7 cells reduced virus secretion by around 70 %, intracellular HCV RNA levels by around 40 %, and core and NS3 proteins by around 95 and 45 %, respectively. Staufen1 appeared to be predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum at the nuclear periphery in both uninfected and HCV-infected Huh7 cells. However, Staufen1 showed significant co-localization with NS3 and dsRNA, indicating that it may bind to replicating HCV RNA that is associated with the non-structural proteins. Staufen1 and HCV core protein localized very closely to one another during infection, but did not appear to overlap, indicating that Staufen1 may not bind to core protein or localize to the core-coated lipid droplets, suggesting that it may not be directly involved in HCV virus assembly. These findings indicate that Staufen1 is an important factor in HCV replication and that it might play a role early in the HCV replication cycle, e.g. in translation, replication or trafficking of the HCV genome, rather than in virion morphogenesis."
22491470,Role for TBC1D20 and Rab1 in hepatitis C virus replication via interaction with lipid droplet-bound nonstructural protein 5A.,"Replication and assembly of hepatitis C virus (HCV) depend on the host's secretory and lipid-biosynthetic machinery. Viral replication occurs on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived modified membranes, while viral assembly is thought to occur on lipid droplets (LDs). A physical association and coordination between the viral replication and assembly complexes are prerequisites for efficient viral production. Nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A), which localizes both to the ER and LDs, is an ideal candidate for this function. Here, the interaction of NS5A with host cell membranes and binding partners was characterized in living cells. The binding of NS5A to LDs is apparently irreversible, both in HCV-infected cells and when ectopically expressed. In HCV-infected cells, NS5A fluorescence was observed around the LDs and in perinuclear structures that were incorporated into a highly immobile platform superimposed over the ER membrane. Moreover, TBC1D20 and its cognate GTPase Rab1 are recruited by NS5A to LDs. The NS5A-TBC1D20 interaction was shown to be essential for the viral life cycle. In cells, expression of the Rab1 dominant negative (Rab1DN) GTPase mutant abolished steady-state LDs. In infected cells, Rab1DN induced the elimination of NS5A from viral replication sites. Our results demonstrate the significance of the localization of NS5A to LDs and support a model whereby its interaction with TBC1D20 and Rab1 affects lipid droplet metabolism to promote the viral life cycle."
16945160,Hepatitis C virus NS2 and NS3/4A proteins are potent inhibitors of host cell cytokine/chemokine gene expression.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes several proteins that interfere with the host cell antiviral response. Previously, the serine protease NS3/4A was shown to inhibit IFN-beta gene expression by blocking dsRNA-activated retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated signaling pathways."
15221897,Expression of hepatitis C virus core protein inhibits interferon-induced nuclear import of STATs.,"IFN-alpha combined with ribavirin is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. However, HCV has mechanisms to resist the antiviral actions of IFN-alpha. In order to study the molecular mechanisms of this resistance, the effect of HCV gene expression on IFN-induced nuclear import of STAT transcription factors and the expression of antiviral MxA protein were studied. In transiently transfected hepatoma cells, HCV core and NS5A proteins clearly inhibited the nuclear import of STAT1 and MxA protein expression (core only), whereas other viral proteins had only a marginal effect. To confirm these observations, human osteosarcoma-derived cell lines, which inducibly express HCV core protein, the entire structural region (core-E1-E2-p7), the NS3-4A complex, NS4B, NS5A, or NS5B proteins were also used. IFN-induced nuclear accumulation of STAT1 was almost completely and STAT2 was partially blocked in cell lines expressing high levels of HCV core protein. Subsequently, in these cells, IFN-alpha-induced MxB protein expression was decreased. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced nuclear import of NF-kappaB was only weakly or not at all inhibited, suggesting that the nuclear import machinery in general was not impaired. The results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which HCV gene expression may interfere with IFN-mediated host defence systems."
23063122,A structural basis for the assembly and functions of a viral polymer that inactivates multiple tumor suppressors.,"Evolution of minimal DNA tumor virus' genomes has selected for small viral oncoproteins that hijack critical cellular protein interaction networks. The structural basis for the multiple and dominant functions of adenovirus oncoproteins has remained elusive. E4-ORF3 forms a nuclear polymer and simultaneously inactivates p53, PML, TRIM24, and MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) tumor suppressors. We identify oligomerization mutants and solve the crystal structure of E4-ORF3. E4-ORF3 forms a dimer with a central β core, and its structure is unrelated to known polymers or oncogenes. E4-ORF3 dimer units coassemble through reciprocal and nonreciprocal exchanges of their C-terminal tails. This results in linear and branched oligomer chains that further assemble in variable arrangements to form a polymer network that partitions the nuclear volume. E4-ORF3 assembly creates avidity-driven interactions with PML and an emergent MRN binding interface. This reveals an elegant structural solution whereby a small protein forms a multivalent matrix that traps disparate tumor suppressors."
23861867,Nonstructural 5A protein of hepatitis C virus interacts with pyruvate carboxylase and modulates viral propagation.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly dependent on cellular factors for its own propagation. By employing tandem affinity purification method, we identified pyruvate carboxylase (PC) as a cellular partner for NS5A protein. NS5A interacted with PC through the N-terminal region of NS5A and the biotin carboxylase domain of PC. PC expression was decreased in cells expressing NS5A and HCV-infected cells. Promoter activity of PC was also decreased by NS5A protein. However, FAS expression was increased in cells expressing NS5A and cell culture grown HCV (HCVcc)-infected cells. Silencing of PC promoted fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression level. These data suggest HCV may modulate PC via NS5A protein for its own propagation."
24067962,Herpes simplex virus 1 E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP0 protein inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced NF-κB activation by interacting with p65/RelA and p50/NF-κB1.,"NF-κB plays central roles in regulation of diverse biological processes, including innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. HSV-1 is the archetypal member of the alphaherpesviruses, with a large genome encoding over 80 viral proteins, many of which are involved in virus-host interactions and show immune modulatory capabilities. In this study, we demonstrated that the HSV-1 ICP0 protein, a viral E3 ubiquitin ligase, was shown to significantly suppress tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-mediated NF-κB activation. ICP0 was demonstrated to bind to the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 by coimmunoprecipitation analysis. ICP0 bound to the Rel homology domain (RHD) of p65. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that ICP0 abolished nuclear translocation of p65 upon TNF-α stimulation. Also, ICP0 degraded p50 via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The RING finger (RF) domain mutant ICP0 (ICP0-RF) lost its ability to inhibit TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation and p65 nuclear translocation and degrade p50. Notably, the RF domain of ICP0 was sufficient to interact with p50 and abolish NF-κB reporter gene activity. Here, it is for the first time shown that HSV-1 ICP0 interacts with p65 and p50, degrades p50 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and prevents NF-κB-dependent gene expression, which may contribute to immune evasion and pathogenesis of HSV-1."
24130483,Caspase-1 promotes Epstein-Barr virus replication by targeting the large tegument protein deneddylase to the nucleus of productively infected cells.,"The large tegument proteins of herpesviruses contain N-terminal cysteine proteases with potent ubiquitin and NEDD8-specific deconjugase activities, but the function of the enzymes during virus replication remains largely unknown. Using as model BPLF1, the homologue encoded by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), we found that induction of the productive virus cycle does not affect the total level of ubiquitin-conjugation but is accompanied by a BPLF1-dependent decrease of NEDD8-adducts and accumulation of free NEDD8. Expression of BPLF1 promotes cullin degradation and the stabilization of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) substrates in the nucleus, while cytoplasmic CRLs and their substrates are not affected. The inactivation of nuclear CRLs is reversed by the N-terminus of CAND1, which inhibits the binding of BPLF1 to cullins and prevents efficient viral DNA replication. Targeting of the deneddylase activity to the nucleus is dependent on processing of the catalytic N-terminus by caspase-1. Inhibition of caspase-1 severely impairs viral DNA synthesis and the release of infectious virus, pointing a previously unrecognized role of the cellular response to danger signals triggered by EBV reactivation in promoting virus replication."
22474075,Herpes virus deneddylases interrupt the cullin-RING ligase neddylation cycle by inhibiting the binding of CAND1.,"The conserved N-terminal domains of the major tegument proteins of herpes viridae encode cysteine proteases with potent ubiquitin and NEDD8-specific deconjugase activity. Here we show that the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded member of this enzyme family, BPLF1, is targeted to cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) via the interaction of the conserved helix-2 with helix-23 of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of cullins, at a site involved in electrostatic interaction with helix-8 of the CRL regulator CAND1. Mutation of the solvent-exposed Asp86 and Asp90 of helix-2 to Arg does not affect the enzymatic activity of BPLF1 but abolishes cullin binding and prevents CRL inactivation. The binding of the catalytically active BPLF1 to cullins inhibits the recruitment of CAND1 to the deneddylated CRLs and promotes the selective degradation of cullins by the proteasome. Cullin proteolysis is rescued by the overexpression of CAND1 or its CTD-binding N-terminal domain. These findings illustrate a new strategy for viral modulation of CRL activity where the combined effects of cullin deneddylation and their targeting for proteasomal degradation drive stable inactivation of the ligases."
16352731,Epstein-Barr virus latent antigen 3C can mediate the degradation of the retinoblastoma protein through an SCF cellular ubiquitin ligase.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) stimulates the proliferation of latently infected B cells and promotes lymphoid malignancies in humans. To address the role of EBV latency protein Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) in regulation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), we transfected EBNA3C into 293, BJAB, and SAOS-2 cells. In this context, a dominant effect of EBNA3C is to decrease Rb protein levels. EBNA3C also rescues an Rb-induced flat cell phenotype and targets Rb for proteasome- and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Further, EBNA3C forms a stable complex with Rb in cells when the proteasome machinery is inhibited and interacts with Rb in vitro, mapping to a conserved domain at the terminus of EBNA3C. Deletion analysis of EBNA3C identified a motif within amino acids 140-149 important for both the binding and regulation of Rb. This motif is of particular interest, because it has also been linked to regulation of the Skp1/Cul1/F-box complex, SCF(Skp2). Indeed, inhibition of Skp2 function with a dominant-negative molecule reduces the ability of EBNA3C to degrade Rb. Skp2 has no detectable effect on Rb levels in the absence of EBNA3C, suggesting that SCF(Skp2) is specifically usurped by EBNA3C for the enhancement of Rb degradation. That EBNA3C has exploited this association suggests that other human malignancies might use a similar strategy to regulate the Rb protein."
16314315,Activation of Sp1-mediated transcription by Rta of Epstein-Barr virus via an interaction with MCAF1.,"Rta is a transcription factor encoded by BRLF1 of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This factor is expressed during the immediate-early stage of the lytic cycle to activate the genes required for EBV lytic development. Although transcription activation by Rta is frequently associated with the binding of Rta to the Rta-response element (RRE) in promoters, Rta sometimes activates promoters without an RRE. Here we show that Rta interacts with an Sp1-interacting protein, MBD1-containing chromatin-associated factor 1 (MCAF1). This interaction is critical to the formation of an Sp1-MCAF1-Rta complex at Sp1 sites. Therefore, following lytic induction and the expression of Rta, Rta increases Sp1-mediated transcription. The genes that are thus activated include p16, p21, SNRPN and BRLF1. However, the binding of Rta to RRE prevents the interaction between Rta and MCAF1; therefore, transcription activation by RRE depends only on Rta, and not on MCAF1 or Sp1. Furthermore, this study finds that MCAF1 promotes the expression of Rta and Zta from EBV, indicating that MCAF1 participates EBV lytic activation. Our study documents the critical role of Rta in regulating the transcription of the genes that are mediated by Sp1."
23504328,Role of RNF4 in the ubiquitination of Rta of Epstein-Barr virus.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes a transcription factor, Rta, which is required to activate the transcription of EBV lytic genes. This study demonstrates that treating P3HR1 cells with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, causes the accumulation of SUMO-Rta and promotes the expression of EA-D. GST pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation studies reveal that RNF4, a RING-domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, interacts with Rta. RNF4 also targets SUMO-2-conjugated Rta and promotes its ubiquitination in vitro. Additionally, SUMO interaction motifs in RNF4 are important to the ubiquitination of Rta because the RNF4 mutant with a mutation at the motifs eliminates ubiquitination. The mutation of four lysine residues on Rta that abrogated SUMO-3 conjugation to Rta also decreases the enhancement of the ubiquitination of Rta by RNF4. This finding demonstrates that RNF4 is a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase of Rta. Finally, knockdown of RNF4 enhances the expression of Rta and EA-D, subsequently promoting EBV lytic replication and virions production. Results of this study significantly contribute to efforts to elucidate a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates Rta ubiquitination to influence the lytic development of EBV."
19748364,Recruitment of fanconi anemia and breast cancer proteins to DNA damage sites is differentially governed by replication.,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, but how the Fanconi pathway protects cells from DNA crosslinks and whether FA proteins act directly on crosslinks remain unclear. We developed a chromatin-IP-based strategy termed eChIP and detected association of multiple FA proteins with DNA crosslinks in vivo. Interdependence analyses revealed that crosslink-specific enrichment of various FA proteins is controlled by distinct mechanisms. BRCA-related FA proteins (BRCA2, FANCJ/BACH1, and FANCN/PALB2), but not FA core and I/D2 complexes, require replication for their crosslink association. FANCD2, but not FANCJ and FANCN, requires the FA core complex for its recruitment. FA core complex requires nucleotide excision repair proteins XPA and XPC for its association. Consistent with the distinct recruitment mechanism, recombination-independent crosslink repair was inversely affected in cells deficient of FANC-core versus BRCA-related FA proteins. Thus, FA proteins participate in distinct DNA damage response mechanisms governed by DNA replication status."
18833293,Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 contributes to nasopharyngeal carcinoma through disruption of PML nuclear bodies.,"Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is strongly associated with several cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a tumor that is endemic in several parts of the world. We have investigated the molecular basis for how EBV latent infection promotes the development of NPC. We show that the viral EBNA1 protein, previously known to be required to maintain the EBV episomes, also causes the disruption of the cellular PML (promyelocytic leukemia) nuclear bodies (or ND10s). This disruption occurs both in the context of a native latent infection and when exogenously expressed in EBV-negative NPC cells and involves loss of the PML proteins. We also show that EBNA1 is partially localized to PML nuclear bodies in NPC cells and interacts with a specific PML isoform. PML disruption by EBNA1 requires binding to the cellular ubiquitin specific protease, USP7 or HAUSP, but is independent of p53. We further observed that p53 activation, DNA repair and apoptosis, all of which depend on PML nuclear bodies, were impaired by EBNA1 expression and that cells expressing EBNA1 were more likely to survive after induction of DNA damage. The results point to an important role for EBNA1 in the development of NPC, in which EBNA1-mediated disruption of PML nuclear bodies promotes the survival of cells with DNA damage."
10544141,The A20 protein interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and alters the LMP1/TRAF1/TRADD complex.,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) interacts with the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor (TRAF) molecules, which are important for LMP1-mediated signaling. Two domains of LMP1 can independently activate NF-kB, carboxyl-terminal activating region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2. The activation of NF-kB by CTAR1 occurs through direct interaction of LMP1 with the TRAF molecules, whereas CTAR2 interacts with the TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD) to activate NF-kB and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). A20, which is induced by LMP1 through NF-kB, can block NF-kB activation from both domains of LMP1 and inhibit JNK activation from CTAR2. A20 also has been shown to associate with TRAF1 and TRAF2. In this study, an interaction between LMP1 and A20 was detected that was increased by TRAF2 overexpression. A20 did not affect the association of TRAF1 with TRAF2 but did displace TRAF1 from the LMP1 complex. The interaction of LMP1 and TRADD was decreased in the presence of A20, and the LMP1-A20 association was decreased by TRADD, suggesting that A20 and TRADD both interact with LMP1 and may compete for binding. These data indicate that A20 alters the interactions between LMP1 and the TRAF molecules and TRADD, affecting the activation of NF-kB, JNK, and perhaps other TRAF-mediated signaling events."
20016921,Identification of cellular factors binding to acetylated HIV-1 integrase.,"The viral protein integrase (IN) catalyzes the integration of the HIV-1 cDNA into the host cellular genome. We have recently demonstrated that IN is acetylated by a cellular histone acetyltransferase, p300, which modifies three lysines located in the C-terminus of the viral factor (Cereseto et al. in EMBO J 24:3070-3081, 2005). This modification enhances IN catalytic activity, as demonstrated by in vitro assays. Consistently, mutations introduced in the targeted lysines greatly decrease the efficiency of HIV-1 integration. Acetylation was proven to regulate protein functions by modulating protein-protein interactions. HIV-1 to efficiently complete its replication steps, including the integration reaction, requires interacting with numerous cellular factors. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether acetylation might modulate the interaction between IN and the cellular factors. To this aim we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening that differs from the screenings so far performed (Rain et al. in Methods 47:291-297, 2009; Studamire and Goff in Retrovirology 5:48, 2008) for using as bait IN constitutively acetylated. From this analysis we have identified thirteen cellular factors involved in transcription, chromatin remodeling, nuclear transport, RNA binding, protein synthesis regulation and microtubule organization. To validate these interactions, binding assays were performed showing that acetylation increases the affinity of IN with specific factors. Nevertheless, few two-hybrid hits bind with the same affinity the acetylated and the unmodified IN. These results further underlie the relevance of IN post-translational modification by acetylation in HIV-1 replication cycle."
10776788,HIV-2 transmembrane protein gp36 binds to the putative cellular receptor proteins P45 and P62.,"Based on the findings that two cellular proteins of 45 kDa (P45) and 62 kDa (P62) serve as the putative receptor molecules for binding of HIV-1 transmembrane protein gp41 to human T, B lymphocytes and monocytes, we examined whether HIV-2 gp36 and HIV-1 gp41 share the putative receptor proteins P45 and P62. In SPR-assay (SPR: surface plasmon resonance), the recombinant soluble gp36 (rsgp36: Env aa518-678 from clone ROD) like the recombinant soluble gp41 (rsgp41: Env aa539-684 from clone BH10) was binding to P45 and P62. By affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE)-analysis, formation of stable rsgp36-P45 and rsgp36-P62 complexes were confirmed, and the interactions of rsgp36 with P45 and P62 is quite strong with a fast association rate and a slow dissociation rate. These results indicate that HIV-2 gp36 and HIV-1 gp41 have the common putative cellular receptor proteins P45 and P62, and the binding of gp36 to human lymphocytes and monocytes could be based on the interaction between gp36 and P45 and P62."
12388682,"Tsg101, an inactive homologue of ubiquitin ligase e2, interacts specifically with human immunodeficiency virus type 2 gag polyprotein and results in increased levels of ubiquitinated gag.","The final stages of budding and release of a retroviral particle from the cell require the late (L) domain of Gag. Recently, ubiquitin and ubiquitin ligases have been implicated in the late stages of retroviral budding. In a yeast two-hybrid screen of a T-cell cDNA library to identify cellular proteins that interact with human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) Gag polyprotein, we identified Tsg101, an inactive homologue of ubiquitin ligase E2. Tsg101 and HIV-2 Gag interact specifically in vitro and in vivo. The interaction requires the L domain PTAPP motif in the p6 domain of HIV-2 Gag and the N-terminal Ubc-conjugation homology domain of Tsg101. Tsg101 is incorporated into HIV-2 virions. Expression of the N-terminal Ubc-conjugation homology domain of Tsg101 inhibits the release of HIV-2 virus particles. Overexpression of Tsg101 results in an increase in the level of ubiquitination of HIV-2 Gag. Our results provide evidence for recruitment of the ubiquitination machinery of the cell during late stages of the viral life cycle, mediated by the viral Gag protein."
22341466,The cytoplasmic domain of the HIV-1 glycoprotein gp41 induces NF-κB activation through TGF-β-activated kinase 1.,"The human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV) primarily infect lymphocytes, which must be activated for efficient viral replication. We show that the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 (gp41CD) of both HIV-1 and SIV induces activation of NF-κB, a cellular factor important for proviral genome transcription and lymphocyte activation. This NF-κB activating property localized to a region 12-25 (SIV) or 59-70 (HIV-1) residues from the gp41 membrane-spanning domain. An siRNA-based screen of 42 key NF-κB regulators revealed that gp41CD-mediated activation occurs through the canonical NF-κB pathway via TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). TAK1 activity was required for gp41CD-mediated NF-κB activation, and HIV-1-derived gp41CD physically interacted with TAK1 through the same region required for NF-κB activation. Importantly, an NF-κB activation-deficient HIV-1 mutant exhibited increased dependence on cellular activation for replication. These findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved role for gp41CD in activating NF-κB to promote infection."
24034250,"EGFR-mediated Beclin 1 phosphorylation in autophagy suppression, tumor progression, and tumor chemoresistance.","Cell surface growth factor receptors couple environmental cues to the regulation of cytoplasmic homeostatic processes, including autophagy, and aberrant activation of such receptors is a common feature of human malignancies. Here, we defined the molecular basis by which the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase regulates autophagy. Active EGFR binds the autophagy protein Beclin 1, leading to its multisite tyrosine phosphorylation, enhanced binding to inhibitors, and decreased Beclin 1-associated VPS34 kinase activity. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy disrupts Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation and binding to its inhibitors and restores autophagy in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells with a TKI-sensitive EGFR mutation. In NSCLC tumor xenografts, the expression of a tyrosine phosphomimetic Beclin 1 mutant leads to reduced autophagy, enhanced tumor growth, tumor dedifferentiation, and resistance to TKI therapy. Thus, oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases directly regulate the core autophagy machinery, which may contribute to tumor progression and chemoresistance."
23890821,Deubiquitinases sharpen substrate discrimination during membrane protein degradation from the ER.,"Newly synthesized membrane proteins are queried by ubiquitin ligase complexes and triaged between degradative and nondegradative fates. The mechanisms that convert modest differences in substrate-ligase interactions into decisive outcomes of ubiquitination are not well understood. Here, we reconstitute membrane protein recognition and ubiquitination in liposomes using purified components from a viral-mediated degradation pathway. We find that substrate-ligase interactions in the membrane directly influence processivity of ubiquitin attachment to modulate polyubiquitination. Unexpectedly, differential processivity alone could not explain the differential fates in cultured cells of degraded and nondegraded clients. Both computational and experimental analyses identified continuous deubiquitination as a prerequisite for maximal substrate discrimination. Deubiquitinases reduce polyubiquitin dwell times preferentially on clients that dissociate more rapidly from the ligase. This explains how small differences in substrate-ligase interaction can be amplified into larger differences in net degradation. These results provide a conceptual framework for substrate discrimination during membrane protein quality control."
24269682,An anti-interferon activity shared by paramyxovirus C proteins: inhibition of Toll-like receptor 7/9-dependent alpha interferon induction.,"Paramyxovirus C protein targets the host interferon (IFN) system for virus immune evasion. To identify its unknown anti-IFN activity, we examined the effect of Sendai virus C protein on activation of the IFN-α promoter via various signaling pathways. This study uncovers a novel ability of C protein to block Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7- and TLR9-dependent IFN-α induction, which is specific to plasmacytoid dendritic cells. C protein interacts with a serine/threonine kinase IKKα and inhibits phosphorylation of IRF7. This anti-IFN activity of C protein is shared across genera of the Paramyxovirinae, and thus appears to play an important role in paramyxovirus immune evasion."
21911577,A physical interaction network of dengue virus and human proteins.,"Dengue virus (DENV), an emerging mosquito-transmitted pathogen capable of causing severe disease in humans, interacts with host cell factors to create a more favorable environment for replication. However, few interactions between DENV and human proteins have been reported to date. To identify DENV-human protein interactions, we used high-throughput yeast two-hybrid assays to screen the 10 DENV proteins against a human liver activation domain library. From 45 DNA-binding domain clones containing either full-length viral genes or partially overlapping gene fragments, we identified 139 interactions between DENV and human proteins, the vast majority of which are novel. These interactions involved 105 human proteins, including six previously implicated in DENV infection and 45 linked to the replication of other viruses. Human proteins with functions related to the complement and coagulation cascade, the centrosome, and the cytoskeleton were enriched among the DENV interaction partners. To determine if the cellular proteins were required for DENV infection, we used small interfering RNAs to inhibit their expression. Six of 12 proteins targeted (CALR, DDX3X, ERC1, GOLGA2, TRIP11, and UBE2I) caused a significant decrease in the replication of a DENV replicon. We further showed that calreticulin colocalized with viral dsRNA and with the viral NS3 and NS5 proteins in DENV-infected cells, consistent with a direct role for calreticulin in DENV replication. Human proteins that interacted with DENV had significantly higher average degree and betweenness than expected by chance, which provides additional support for the hypothesis that viruses preferentially target cellular proteins that occupy central position in the human protein interaction network. This study provides a valuable starting point for additional investigations into the roles of human proteins in DENV infection."
17005699,Functional interaction between human herpesvirus 6 immediate-early 2 protein and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 in the absence of sumoylation.,"The immediate-early 2 (IE2) protein of human herpesvirus 6 is a potent transactivator of cellular and viral promoters. To better understand the biology of IE2, we generated a LexA-IE2 fusion protein and screened, using the yeast two-hybrid system, a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library for proteins that could interact with IE2. The most frequently isolated IE2-interacting protein was the human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), a protein involved in the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation pathway. Using deletion mutants of IE2, we mapped the IE2-Ubc9-interacting region to residues 989 to 1037 of IE2. The interaction was found to be of functional significance to IE2, as Ubc9 overexpression significantly repressed promoter activation by IE2. The C93S Ubc9 mutant exhibited a similar effect on IE2, indicating that the E2 SUMO-conjugating function of Ubc9 is not required for its repressive action on IE2. No consensus sumoylation sites or evidence of IE2 conjugation to SUMO could be demonstrated under in vivo or in vitro conditions. Moreover, expression levels and nuclear localization of IE2 were not altered by Ubc9 overexpression, suggesting that Ubc9's repressive function likely occurs at the transcriptional complex level. Overall, our results indicate that Ubc9 influences IE2's function and provide new information on the complex interactions that occur between herpesviruses and the sumoylation pathway."
12753906,Interaction of Sp1 transcription factor with HIV-1 Tat protein: looking for cellular partners.,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) trans-activates HIV-1 transcription by functionally interacting with a number of cellular proteins, among which the Sp1 transcription factor. We recently demonstrated that Tat does not directly interact with Sp1 either in vitro or in vivo, and we suggested that other protein(s) could indirectly mediate Tat-Sp1 interaction. In keeping, here we showed that addition of HeLa cell nuclear extracts to purified Tat and Sp1 proteins allows the formation of a Tat/Sp1 complex in in vitro binding assays. In an attempt to identify the partner(s) that bridge Tat and Sp1, we developed a yeast multi-protein system, in which cellular proteins recently shown to play a relevant role in Tat function, namely TATA box-binding protein, cyclin T1, CDK9, and cyclin T1/CDK9 complex, were coexpressed, individually or in pair-wise combination, with Tat and Sp1 hybrids. We demonstrated that none of these candidate partners bridges Tat and Sp1. However, our yeast multi-protein system, which allows simple and rapid detection of interactions among up to four proteins, will be most helpful to further dissect the interaction of Tat and Sp1 with other candidate partners that participate in the assembly of transcriptionally active complexes at the HIV-1 LTR."
24008843,Structure homology and interaction redundancy for discovering virus-host protein interactions.,"Virus-host interactomes are instrumental to understand global perturbations of cellular functions induced by infection and discover new therapies. The construction of such interactomes is, however, technically challenging and time consuming. Here we describe an original method for the prediction of high-confidence interactions between viral and human proteins through a combination of structure and high-quality interactome data. Validation was performed for the NS1 protein of the influenza virus, which led to the identification of new host factors that control viral replication."
24412650,Premature activation of the SLX4 complex by Vpr promotes G2/M arrest and escape from innate immune sensing.,"The HIV auxiliary protein Vpr potently blocks the cell cycle at the G2/M transition. Here, we show that G2/M arrest results from untimely activation of the structure-specific endonuclease (SSE) regulator SLX4 complex (SLX4com) by Vpr, a process that requires VPRBP-DDB1-CUL4 E3-ligase complex. Direct interaction of Vpr with SLX4 induced the recruitment of VPRBP and kinase-active PLK1, enhancing the cleavage of DNA by SLX4-associated MUS81-EME1 endonucleases. G2/M arrest-deficient Vpr alleles failed to interact with SLX4 or to induce recruitment of MUS81 and PLK1. Furthermore, knockdown of SLX4, MUS81, or EME1 inhibited Vpr-induced G2/M arrest. In addition, we show that the SLX4com is involved in suppressing spontaneous and HIV-1-mediated induction of type 1 interferon and establishment of antiviral responses. Thus, our work not only reveals the identity of the cellular factors required for Vpr-mediated G2/M arrest but also identifies the SLX4com as a regulator of innate immunity."
22379092,"A protein array screen for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus LANA interactors links LANA to TIP60, PP2A activity, and telomere shortening.","The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) LANA protein functions in latently infected cells as an essential participant in KSHV genome replication and as a driver of dysregulated cell growth. To identify novel LANA protein-cell protein interactions that could contribute to these activities, we performed a proteomic screen in which purified, adenovirus-expressed Flag-LANA protein was incubated with an array displaying 4,192 nonredundant human proteins. Sixty-one interacting cell proteins were consistently detected. LANA interactions with high-mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1), HMGB1, telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1), xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XPA), pygopus homolog 2 (PYGO2), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)B subunit, Tat-interactive protein 60 (TIP60), replication protein A1 (RPA1), and RPA2 proteins were confirmed in coimmunoprecipitation assays. LANA-associated TIP60 retained acetyltransferase activity and, unlike human papillomavirus E6 and HIV-1 TAT proteins, LANA did not reduce TIP60 stability. The LANA-bound PP2A B subunit was associated with the PP2A A subunit but not the catalytic C subunit, suggesting a disruption of PP2A phosphatase activity. This is reminiscent of the role of simian virus 40 (SV40) small t antigen. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed binding of RPA1 and RPA2 to the KSHV terminal repeats. Interestingly, LANA expression ablated RPA1 and RPA2 binding to the cell telomeric repeats. In U2OS cells that rely on the alternative mechanism for telomere maintenance, LANA expression had minimal effect on telomere length. However, LANA expression in telomerase immortalized endothelial cells resulted in telomere shortening. In KSHV-infected cells, telomere shortening may be one more mechanism by which LANA contributes to the development of malignancy."
19454010,In vitro nuclear interactome of the HIV-1 Tat protein.,"One facet of the complexity underlying the biology of HIV-1 resides not only in its limited number of viral proteins, but in the extensive repertoire of cellular proteins they interact with and their higher-order assembly. HIV-1 encodes the regulatory protein Tat (86-101aa), which is essential for HIV-1 replication and primarily orchestrates HIV-1 provirus transcriptional regulation. Previous studies have demonstrated that Tat function is highly dependent on specific interactions with a range of cellular proteins. However they can only partially account for the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamics of proviral gene expression. To obtain a comprehensive nuclear interaction map of Tat in T-cells, we have designed a proteomic strategy based on affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry."
8173552,Interaction of human plasma fibronectin with viral proteins of human immunodeficiency virus.,"Fibronectin (FN) is present in soluble and matrix forms in various body fluids and tissues, and has been shown to bind to several pathogens, including viruses. The interaction of FN with viral proteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) was investigated by immunofluorescence technique using a cell line chronically infected with HIV-1 (H9-V). The results of this study showed that FN binds to HIV-1 infected cells, especially at FN concentration of 5 micrograms/ml. In addition, FN-pentapeptide has shown the ability to bind to HIV-1 infected cells. On the other hand, preincubation with antibodies against FN abolished the binding of FN to HIV-1 infected cells. Finally, FN has shown to bind to HIV-1 glycoproteins, including gp41 and gp120. In contrast, no binding to HIV-1 core proteins, including p15 and p24, was noted. We suggest that FN, in binding HIV-1 particles, may reduce viremia and thus may be involved in the clearance of viral proteins from the cells."
20190741,A deneddylase encoded by Epstein-Barr virus promotes viral DNA replication by regulating the activity of cullin-RING ligases.,"The large tegument proteins of herpesviruses encode conserved cysteine proteases of unknown function. Here we show that BPLF1, the Epstein-Barr-virus-encoded member of this protease family, is a deneddylase that regulates virus production by modulating the activity of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs). BPLF1 hydrolyses NEDD8 conjugates in vitro, acts as a deneddylase in vivo, binds to cullins and stabilizes CRL substrates. Expression of BPLF1 alone or in the context of the productive virus cycle induces accumulation of the licensing factor CDT1 and deregulates S-phase DNA synthesis. Inhibition of BPLF1 during the productive virus cycle prevents cellular DNA re-replication and inhibits virus replication. Viral DNA synthesis is restored by overexpression of CDT1. Homologues encoded by other herpesviruses share the deneddylase activity. Thus, these enzymes are likely to have a key function in the virus life cycle by inducing a replication-permissive S-phase-like cellular environment."
21325409,"The Epstein-Barr virus BRRF1 protein, Na, induces lytic infection in a TRAF2- and p53-dependent manner.","The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BRRF1 lytic gene product (Na) is encoded within the same immediate-early region as the BZLF1 (Z) and BRLF1(R) gene products, but its role during EBV infection has not been well defined. We previously showed that Na cooperates with the R protein to induce lytic gene expression in latently infected EBV-positive 293 cells, and in some EBV-negative cell lines it can activate the Z promoter in reporter gene assays. Here we show that overexpression of Na alone is sufficient to induce lytic gene expression in several different latently infected epithelial cell lines (Hone-Akata, CNE2-Akata, and AGS-Akata), while knockdown of endogenous Na expression reduces lytic gene expression. Consistent with its ability to interact with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) in a yeast two-hybrid assay, we demonstrate that Na interacts with TRAF2 in cells. Furthermore, we show that TRAF2 is required for Na induction of lytic gene expression, that Na induces Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation in a TRAF2-dependent manner, and that a JNK inhibitor abolishes the ability of Na to disrupt viral latency. Additionally, we show that Na and the tumor suppressor protein p53 cooperate to induce lytic gene expression in epithelial cells (including the C666-1 nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line), although Na does not appear to affect p53 function. Together these data suggest that Na plays an important role in regulating the switch between latent and lytic infection in epithelial cells and that this effect requires both the TRAF2 and p53 cellular proteins."
22909819,A new class of carriers that transport selective cargo from the trans Golgi network to the cell surface.,"We have isolated a membrane fraction enriched in a class of transport carriers that form at the trans Golgi network (TGN) and are destined for the cell surface in HeLa cells. Protein kinase D (PKD) is required for the biogenesis of these carriers that contain myosin II, Rab6a, Rab8a, and synaptotagmin II, as well as a number of secretory and plasma membrane-specific cargoes. Our findings reveal a requirement for myosin II in the migration of these transport carriers but not in their biogenesis per se. Based on the cargo secreted by these carriers we have named them CARTS for CARriers of the TGN to the cell Surface. Surprisingly, CARTS are distinct from the carriers that transport vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G protein and collagen I from the TGN to the cell surface. Altogether, the identification of CARTS provides a valuable means to understand TGN to cell surface traffic."
22623778,Human respiratory syncytial virus nucleoprotein and inclusion bodies antagonize the innate immune response mediated by MDA5 and MAVS.,"Currently, the spatial distribution of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) proteins and RNAs in infected cells is still under investigation, with many unanswered questions regarding the interaction of virus-induced structures and the innate immune system. Very few studies of hRSV have used subcellular imaging as a means to explore the changes in localization of retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors or the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, in response to the infection and formation of viral structures. In this investigation, we found that both RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) colocalized with viral genomic RNA and the nucleoprotein (N) as early as 6 h postinfection (hpi). By 12 hpi, MDA5 and MAVS were observed within large viral inclusion bodies (IB). We used a proximity ligation assay (PLA) and determined that the N protein was in close proximity to MDA5 and MAVS in IBs throughout the course of the infection. Similar results were found with the transient coexpression of N and the phosphoprotein (P). Additionally, we demonstrated that the localization of MDA5 and MAVS in IBs inhibited the expression of interferon β mRNA 27-fold following Newcastle disease virus infection. From these data, we concluded that the N likely interacts with MDA5, is in close proximity to MAVS, and localizes these molecules within IBs in order to attenuate the interferon response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a specific function for hRSV IBs and of the hRSV N protein as a modulator of the innate immune response."
20601427,Heat shock protein 72 is associated with the hepatitis C virus replicase complex and enhances viral RNA replication.,"The NS5A protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an integral component of the viral replicase. It also modulates cellular signaling and perturbs host interferon responses. The multifunctional characteristics of NS5A are mostly attributed to its ability to interact with various cellular proteins. This study aimed to identify the novel cellular factors that interact with NS5A and decipher the significance of this interaction in viral replication. The NS5A-interacting proteins were purified by the tandem affinity purification (TAP) procedure from cells expressing NS5A and identified by mass spectrometry. The chaperone protein Hsp72 was identified herein. In vivo protein-protein interaction was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and an in situ proximity ligation assay. In addition to NS5A, Hsp72 was also associated with other members of the replicase complex, NS3 and NS5B, suggesting that it might be directly involved in the HCV replication complex. Hsp72 plays a positive regulatory role in HCV RNA replication by increasing levels of the replicase complex, which was attributed either to the increased stability of the viral proteins in the replicase complex or to the enhanced translational activity of the internal ribosome entry site of HCV. The fact that the host chaperone protein Hsp72 is involved in HCV RNA replication may represent a therapeutic target for controlling virus production."
21454548,Impairment of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 integrase SUMOylation correlates with an early replication defect.,"HIV-1 integrase (IN) orchestrates the integration of the reverse transcribed viral cDNA into the host cell genome and participates also in other steps of HIV-1 replication. Cellular and viral factors assist IN in performing its multiple functions, and post-translational modifications contribute to modulate its activities. Here, we show that HIV-1 IN is modified by SUMO proteins and that phylogenetically conserved SUMOylation consensus motifs represent major SUMO acceptor sites. Viruses harboring SUMOylation site IN mutants displayed a replication defect that was mapped during the early stages of infection, before integration but after reverse transcription. Because SUMOylation-defective IN mutants retained WT catalytic activity, we hypothesize that SUMOylation might regulate the affinity of IN for co-factors, contributing to efficient HIV-1 replication."
21454661,Host protein Ku70 binds and protects HIV-1 integrase from proteasomal degradation and is required for HIV replication.,"HIV-1 integrase (IN) is a key viral enzymatic protein acting in several viral replication steps, including integration. IN has been shown to be an unstable protein degraded by the N-end rule pathway through the host ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. However, it is still not fully understood how this viral protein is protected from the host ubiquitin-proteasome system within cells during HIV replication. In the present study, we provide evidence that the host protein Ku70 interacts with HIV-1 IN and protects it from the Lys(48)-linked polyubiquitination proteasomal pathway. Moreover, Ku70 is able to down-regulate the overall protein polyubiquitination level within the host cells and to specifically deubiquitinate IN through their interaction. Mutagenic studies revealed that the C terminus of IN (residues 230-288) is required for IN binding to the N-terminal part of Ku70 (Ku70(1-430)), and their interaction is independent of Ku70/80 heterodimerization. Finally, knockdown of Ku70 expression in both virus-producing and target CD4(+) T cells significantly disrupted HIV-1 replication and rendered two-long terminal repeat circles and integration undetectable, indicating that Ku70 is required for both the early and the late stages of the HIV-1 life cycle. Interestingly, Ku70 was incorporated into the progeny virus in an IN-dependent way. We proposed that Ku70 may interact with IN during viral assembly and accompany HIV-1 IN upon entry into the new target cells, acting to 1) protect IN from the host defense system and 2) assist IN integration activity. Overall, this report provides another example of how HIV-1 hijacks host cellular machinery to protect the virus itself and to facilitate its replication."
17538020,The clathrin adaptor complex AP-1 binds HIV-1 and MLV Gag and facilitates their budding.,"Retroviral assembly is driven by Gag, and nascent viral particles escape cells by recruiting the machinery that forms intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. In this study, we show that the clathrin adaptor complex AP-1 is involved in retroviral release. The absence of AP-1mu obtained by genetic knock-out or by RNA interference reduces budding of murine leukemia virus (MLV) and HIV-1, leading to a delay of viral propagation in cell culture. In contrast, overexpression of AP-1mu enhances release of HIV-1 Gag. We show that the AP-1 complex facilitates retroviral budding through a direct interaction between the matrix and AP-1mu. Less MLV Gag is found associated with late endosomes in cells lacking AP-1, and our results suggest that AP-1 and AP-3 could function on the same pathway that leads to Gag release. In addition, we find that AP-1 interacts with Tsg101 and Nedd4.1, two cellular proteins known to be involved in HIV-1 and MLV budding. We propose that AP-1 promotes Gag release by transporting it to intracellular sites of active budding, and/or by facilitating its interactions with other cellular partners."
18006034,"TULA proteins bind to ABCE-1, a host factor of HIV-1 assembly, and inhibit HIV-1 biogenesis in a UBA-dependent fashion.","TULA, a recently identified UBA- and SH3-containing protein, has previously been shown to regulate cell signaling through protein tyrosine kinases. In order to search for novel functions of TULA, we identified, using mass spectrometry, proteins associated with TULA. ABCE-1 also known as RLI and HP68, a host factor of HIV-1 assembly, was found among TULA-associated proteins in these experiments. Considering an important role of ABCE-1 in HIV-1 assembly, we were compelled to analyze the effect of TULA on HIV-1 biogenesis. Our study provides evidence that TULA proteins substantially inhibit production of both sub-genomic and full-length HIV-1 viral particles and that the effect of TULA is dependent on UBA domain-mediated interactions. The primary role of ABCE-1 in the effect of TULA appears to be the recruitment of TULA to the sites of HIV-1 assembly where TULA interferes with the late steps of the HIV-1 life cycle, most likely by disrupting essential ubiquitylation-dependent events that remain to be identified."
19249802,Fragile X mental retardation protein restricts replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"Gag protein is the major structural component of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles and drives virus assembly on cellular membranes. This function of Gag is attributed to its intrinsic self-multimerization ability as well as its interaction with cellular factors such as TSG101 that binds to the PTAP sequence in the p6 region of Gag and promotes HIV-1 budding through recruiting the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport). As a result of its essential role in virus assembly, Gag also becomes the target of cellular restriction factors such as APOBEC3G and Trim5alpha. In this study, we report that the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) interacts with HIV-1 Gag and is packaged into virus particles. Although knockdown of FMRP does not markedly affect production of virus particles, infectivity of HIV-1 virions was significantly decreased. Consistent with this observation, overexpression of the wild type FMRP, but not the FMRP mutants that lack the KH1 or the KH2 domains, led to 2- to 3-fold reduction of virus infectivity. Together, these results suggest that FMRP diminishes HIV-1 infectivity through association with viral Gag protein and virus particles."
16527808,Association of RNA helicase a with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 particles.,"RNA helicase A (RHA) belongs to the DEAH family of proteins that are capable of unwinding double-stranded RNA structure. In addition to its involvement in the metabolism of cellular RNA, RHA has been shown to stimulate RNA transcription from the long terminal repeat promoter of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) as well as to enhance Rev/Rev response element-mediated gene expression. In this study, we provide evidence that RHA associates with HIV-1 Gag in an RNA-dependent manner. This interaction results in specific incorporation of RHA into HIV-1 particles. Knockdown of endogenous RHA in virus producer cells leads to generation of HIV-1 particles that are less infectious in part as a result of restricted reverse transcription. Therefore, RHA represents the first example of cellular RNA helicases that participate in HIV-1 particle production and promote viral reverse transcription."
23895345,Ubiquitin conjugation to Gag is essential for ESCRT-mediated HIV-1 budding.,"HIV-1 relies on the host ESCRTs for release from cells. HIV-1 Gag engages ESCRTs by directly binding TSG101 or Alix. ESCRTs also sort ubiquitinated membrane proteins through endosomes to facilitate their lysosomal degradation. The ability of ESCRTs to recognize and process ubiquitinated proteins suggests that ESCRT-dependent viral release may also be controlled by ubiquitination. Although both Gag and ESCRTs undergo some level of ubiquitination, definitive demonstration that ubiquitin is required for viral release is lacking. Here we suppress ubiquitination at viral budding sites by fusing the catalytic domain of the Herpes Simplex UL36 deubiquitinating enzyme (DUb) onto TSG101, Alix, or Gag."
18385235,"Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA binding protein 1 associates with Gag protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and its overexpression affects virus assembly.","The assembly of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles is driven by viral Gag protein. This function of Gag not only benefits from its self-multimerization property but also depends on its interaction with a number of cellular factors such as TSG101 and ALIX/AIP1 that promote virus budding and release from cell surfaces. However, interaction with Gag also allows some cellular factors such as APOBEC3G and Trim5alpha to access viral replication machinery and block viral replication. In this study, we report a new HIV-1 Gag-binding factor named insulin-like growth factor II mRNA binding protein 1 (IMP1). Gag-IMP1 interaction requires the second zinc finger of the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Gag and the KH3 and KH4 domains of IMP1. A fourfold reduction of HIV-1 infectivity was seen with overexpression of the wild-type IMP1 and its mutant that is able to interact with Gag but not with overexpression of IMP1 mutants exhibiting Gag-binding deficiency. The decreased viral infectivity was further shown as a result of diminished viral RNA packaging, abrogated Gag processing on the cellular membranes, and impeded maturation of virus particles. Together, these results demonstrate that IMP1 interacts with HIV-1 Gag protein and is able to block the formation of infectious HIV-1 particles."
22093708,Human HERC5 restricts an early stage of HIV-1 assembly by a mechanism correlating with the ISGylation of Gag.,"The identification and characterization of several interferon (IFN)-induced cellular HIV-1 restriction factors, defined as host cellular proteins or factors that restrict or inhibit the HIV-1 life cycle, have provided insight into the IFN response towards HIV-1 infection and identified new therapeutic targets for HIV-1 infection. To further characterize the mechanism underlying restriction of the late stages of HIV-1 replication, we assessed the ability of IFNbeta-induced genes to restrict HIV-1 Gag particle production and have identified a potentially novel host factor called HECT domain and RCC1-like domain-containing protein 5 (HERC5) that blocks a unique late stage of the HIV-1 life cycle."
22190037,Vif hijacks CBF-β to degrade APOBEC3G and promote HIV-1 infection.,"Restriction factors, such as the retroviral complementary DNA deaminase APOBEC3G, are cellular proteins that dominantly block virus replication. The AIDS virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), produces the accessory factor Vif, which counteracts the host's antiviral defence by hijacking a ubiquitin ligase complex, containing CUL5, ELOC, ELOB and a RING-box protein, and targeting APOBEC3G for degradation. Here we reveal, using an affinity tag/purification mass spectrometry approach, that Vif additionally recruits the transcription cofactor CBF-β to this ubiquitin ligase complex. CBF-β, which normally functions in concert with RUNX DNA binding proteins, allows the reconstitution of a recombinant six-protein assembly that elicits specific polyubiquitination activity with APOBEC3G, but not the related deaminase APOBEC3A. Using RNA knockdown and genetic complementation studies, we also demonstrate that CBF-β is required for Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3G and therefore for preserving HIV-1 infectivity. Finally, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Vif also binds to and requires CBF-β to degrade rhesus macaque APOBEC3G, indicating functional conservation. Methods of disrupting the CBF-β-Vif interaction might enable HIV-1 restriction and provide a supplement to current antiviral therapies that primarily target viral proteins."
14550573,Human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein interacts with distinct proteasomal alpha and beta subunits.,"The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat protein was previously reported to compete the association of PA28 regulator with the alpha rings of the 20S proteasome and to inhibit its peptidase activity. However, the distinct interaction sites within the proteasome complex remained to be determined. Here we show that HIV-1 Tat binds to alpha4 and alpha7, six beta subunits of the constitutive 20S proteasome and the interferon-gamma-inducible subunits beta2i and beta5i. A Tat-proteasome interaction can also be demonstrated in vivo and leads to inhibition of proteasomal activity. This indicates that Tat can modulate or interfere with cellular proteasome function by specific interaction with distinct proteasomal subunits."
18498648,Lysine methylation of HIV-1 Tat regulates transcriptional activity of the viral LTR.,"The rate of transcription of the HIV-1 viral genome is mediated by the interaction of the viral protein Tat with the LTR and other transcriptional machinery. These specific interactions can be affected by the state of post-translational modifications on Tat. Previously, we have shown that Tat can be phosphorylated and acetylated in vivo resulting in an increase in the rate of transcription. In the present study, we investigated whether Tat could be methylated on lysine residues, specifically on lysine 50 and 51, and whether this modification resulted in a decrease of viral transcription from the LTR."
11907272,FBI-1 can stimulate HIV-1 Tat activity and is targeted to a novel subnuclear domain that includes the Tat-P-TEFb-containing nuclear speckles.,"FBI-1 is a cellular POZ-domain-containing protein that binds to the HIV-1 LTR and associates with the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat. Here we show that elevated levels of FBI-1 specifically stimulate Tat activity and that this effect is dependent on the same domain of FBI-1 that mediates Tat-FBI-1 association in vivo. FBI-1 also partially colocalizes with Tat and Tat's cellular cofactor, P-TEFb (Cdk9 and cyclin T1), at the splicing-factor-rich nuclear speckle domain. Further, a less-soluble population of FBI-1 distributes in a novel peripheral-speckle pattern of localization as well as in other nuclear regions. This distribution pattern is dependent on the FBI-1 DNA binding domain, on the presence of cellular DNA, and on active transcription. Taken together, these results suggest that FBI-1 is a cellular factor that preferentially associates with active chromatin and that can specifically stimulate Tat-activated HIV-1 transcription."
8934526,Enhanced processivity of RNA polymerase II triggered by Tat-induced phosphorylation of its carboxy-terminal domain.,"The protein Tat is encoded by the HIV-1 genome and is essential for viral replication because of its activation of viral transcription. Tat enhances the ability of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to move long distances down the DNA through a poorly understood mechanism that involves its binding the to the 5' end of the nascent HIV-1 transcript. It has been suggested that the stimulation of transcript elongation by conventional DNA-binding activators may involve phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II by the transcription factor TFIIH through the associated CAK kinase. Here we show that Tat-enhanced HIV-1 transcription in vitro requires both TFIIH and the CTD of Pol II. In addition, Tat, through its activation domain, both interacts with a functional TFIIH-containing complex and stimulates phosphorylation of a CTD-containing substrate by the TFIIH kinase. Under conditions that jointly restrict transcriptional elongation and TFIIH-mediated CTD phosphorylation, Tat stimulates both these activities. Furthermore, RNA synthesis is required for Tat to stimulate phosphorylation of the CTD when it is part of an initiation complex, as expected from Tat's interaction with viral transcripts. Thus, stimulation of Pol II elongation by Tat may involve direct effects on TFIIH-mediated CTD phosphorylation."
9334327,The HIV transactivator TAT binds to the CDK-activating kinase and activates the phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.,"The human immunodeficiency virus encodes the transcriptional transactivator Tat, which binds to the transactivation response (TAR) RNA stem-loop in the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) and increases rates of elongation rather than initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In this study, we demonstrate that Tat binds directly to the cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), which leads to productive interactions between Tat and the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex and between Tat and TFIIH. Tat activates the phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II by CAK in vitro. The ability of CAK to phosphorylate the CTD can be inhibited specifically by a CDK7 pseudosubstrate peptide that also inhibits transcriptional activation by Tat in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that the phosphorylation of the CTD by CAK is essential for Tat transactivation. Our data identify a cellular protein that interacts with the activation domain of Tat, demonstrate that this interaction is critical for the function of Tat, and provide a mechanism by which Tat increases the processivity of Pol II."
16687403,The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex is a cofactor for Tat transactivation of the HIV promoter.,"Tat is a critical viral transactivator essential for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene expression. Activation involves binding to an RNA stem-loop structure and recruitment of the positive transcription elongation factor b. Tat also induces the remodeling of a single nucleosome in the HIV promoter. However, the mechanism of this remodeling has remained unclear. Knockdown of INI-1 and BRG-1, two components of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, suppressed Tat-mediated transactivation. Cells lacking INI-1 (G401 and MON) or BRG-1 (C33A) exhibited defective transactivation by Tat that was restored upon INI-1 and BRG-1 expression, respectively. Tat was co-immunoprecipitated with several SWI/SNF subunits, including INI-1, BRG-1, and beta-actin. The SWI/SNF complex interacted with the integrated HIV promoter in a Tat-dependent manner. We also found that INI-1 and BRG-1 synergized with the p300 acetyltransferase to activate the HIV promoter. This synergism depended on the acetyltransferase activity of p300 and on Tat Lys(50) and Lys(51). In conclusion, Tat-mediated activation of the HIV promoter requires the SWI/SNF complex in synergy with the coactivator p300."
9184228,Purification of a Tat-associated kinase reveals a TFIIH complex that modulates HIV-1 transcription.,"The Tat protein is a transcriptional activator which is required for efficient human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) gene expression Tat stimulates HIV-1 transcriptional elongation by increasing the processivity of RNA polymerase II. To address whether Tat-mediated effects on HIV-1 gene expression are due to modulation in the phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD), we developed a purification protocol to identify cellular kinases that are capable of binding to Tat and hyperphosphorylating the RNA polymerase II CTD. A 600 kDa protein complex with these properties was isolated, and specific components were identified using peptide microsequence analysis. This analysis indicated that proteins comprising the multi-subunit TFIIH complex, in addition to several novel factors, were associated with Tat using both in vitro and in vivo analysis. The Tat-associated kinase bound to the activation domain of Tat, and its ability to hyperphosphorylate RNA polymerase II was markedly stimulated by Tat. Furthermore, the addition of the Tat-associated kinase to in vitro transcription assays stimulated the ability of Tat to activate HIV-1 transcription. These results define a cellular kinase complex whose activity is modulated by Tat to result in activation of HIV-1 trancription."
21556766,The 156KELK159 tetrapeptide of HIV-1 integrase is critical for lentiviral gene integration.,"HIV-1 integrase (HIV-1 IN), a key element of HIV-1-derived lentiviral vectors, is crucial for the stable maintenance of the vector gene by inserting them into host genome. HIV-1 IN has been found to have functions other than integration, such as involving in virion morphology, viral DNA synthesis and viral DNA nuclear import. In our study, the yeast two-hybrid assay identified a tetrapeptide 156KELK159 in HIV-1 IN that was crucial for HIV-1 IN and Daxx interaction. To investigate the functions of the tetrapeptide 156KELK159 of the HIV-1 IN, both the wild type HIV-1 IN and a mutant without 156KELK159 were used to package the EGFP reporter gene contained lentivirus. p24 based titer assay revealed that deleting the tetrapeptide did not affect virus packaging. The result was verified by quantitative real time PCR with viral specific primers. But the 156KELK159 was crucial for lentiviral gene integration. Deleting the tetrapeptide made the percentage of cells expressing the reporter gene significantly decreased and did not affect the level of DNA entered into the cells or nucleus. Real time reverse transcription PCR and FACS were used to detect the lentiviral report gene expression in infection maintaining cells and revealed 156KELK159 did not affect lentiviral vector gene expression. Our results may shed light on the regulatory mechanism of gene integration of lentivirus."
23284715,Brain transcriptome-wide screen for HIV-1 Nef protein interaction partners reveals various membrane-associated proteins.,"HIV-1 Nef protein contributes essentially to the pathology of AIDS by a variety of protein-protein-interactions within the host cell. The versatile functionality of Nef is partially attributed to different conformational states and posttranslational modifications, such as myristoylation. Up to now, many interaction partners of Nef have been identified using classical yeast two-hybrid screens. Such screens rely on transcriptional activation of reporter genes in the nucleus to detect interactions. Thus, the identification of Nef interaction partners that are integral membrane proteins, membrane-associated proteins or other proteins that do not translocate into the nucleus is hampered. In the present study, a split-ubiquitin based yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify novel membrane-localized interaction partners of Nef. More than 80% of the hereby identified interaction partners of Nef are transmembrane proteins. The identified hits are GPM6B, GPM6A, BAP31, TSPAN7, CYB5B, CD320/TCblR, VSIG4, PMEPA1, OCIAD1, ITGB1, CHN1, PH4, CLDN10, HSPA9, APR-3, PEBP1 and B3GNT, which are involved in diverse cellular processes like signaling, apoptosis, neurogenesis, cell adhesion and protein trafficking or quality control. For a subfraction of the hereby identified proteins we present data supporting their direct interaction with HIV-1 Nef. We discuss the results with respect to many phenotypes observed in HIV infected cells and patients. The identified Nef interaction partners may help to further elucidate the molecular basis of HIV-related diseases."
21455494,Rhesus TRIM5α disrupts the HIV-1 capsid at the inter-hexamer interfaces.,"TRIM proteins play important roles in the innate immune defense against retroviral infection, including human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Rhesus macaque TRIM5α (TRIM5α(rh)) targets the HIV-1 capsid and blocks infection at an early post-entry stage, prior to reverse transcription. Studies have shown that binding of TRIM5α to the assembled capsid is essential for restriction and requires the coiled-coil and B30.2/SPRY domains, but the molecular mechanism of restriction is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated, by cryoEM combined with mutagenesis and chemical cross-linking, the direct interactions between HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) assemblies and purified TRIM5α(rh) containing coiled-coil and SPRY domains (CC-SPRY(rh)). Concentration-dependent binding of CC-SPRY(rh) to CA assemblies was observed, while under equivalent conditions the human protein did not bind. Importantly, CC-SPRY(rh), but not its human counterpart, disrupted CA tubes in a non-random fashion, releasing fragments of protofilaments consisting of CA hexamers without dissociation into monomers. Furthermore, such structural destruction was prevented by inter-hexamer crosslinking using P207C/T216C mutant CA with disulfide bonds at the CTD-CTD trimer interface of capsid assemblies, but not by intra-hexamer crosslinking via A14C/E45C at the NTD-NTD interface. The same disruption effect by TRIM5α(rh) on the inter-hexamer interfaces also occurred with purified intact HIV-1 cores. These results provide insights concerning how TRIM5α disrupts the virion core and demonstrate that structural damage of the viral capsid by TRIM5α is likely one of the important components of the mechanism of TRIM5α-mediated HIV-1 restriction."
17543365,Functional interplay between the B-box 2 and the B30.2(SPRY) domains of TRIM5alpha.,"The retroviral restriction factors, TRIM5alpha and TRIMCyp, consist of RING and B-box 2 domains separated by a coiled coil from carboxy-terminal domains. These carboxy-terminal domains (the B30.2(SPRY) domain in TRIM5alpha and the cyclophilin A domain in TRIMCyp) recognize the retroviral capsid. Here we show that some B-box 2 changes in TRIM5alpha, but not in TRIMCyp, resulted in decreased human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) capsid binding. The phenotypic effects of these B-box 2 changes on the restriction of retroviral infection depended on the potency of restriction and the affinity of the TRIM5alpha interaction with the viral capsid, two properties specified by the B30.2(SPRY) domain. Thus, some alterations in the TRIM5alpha B-box 2 domain apparently affect the orientation or conformation of the B30.2(SPRY) domain, influencing capsid recognition."
16808955,Characterization of TRIM5alpha trimerization and its contribution to human immunodeficiency virus capsid binding.,"The coiled-coil domain of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family protein TRIM5alpha is required for trimerization and function as an antiretroviral restriction factor. Unlike the coiled-coil regions of other related TRIM proteins, the coiled coil of TRIM5alpha is not sufficient for multimerization. The linker region between the coiled-coil and B30.2 domains is necessary for efficient TRIM5alpha trimerization. Most of the hydrophilic residues predicted to be located on the surface-exposed face of the coiled coil can be altered without compromising TRIM5alpha antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). However, changes that disrupt TRIM5alpha trimerization proportionately affect the ability of TRIM5alpha to bind HIV-1 capsid complexes. Therefore, TRIM5alpha trimerization makes a major contribution to its avidity for the retroviral capsid, and to the ability to restrict virus infection."
21886773,HIV-1 Nef induces proinflammatory state in macrophages through its acidic cluster domain: involvement of TNF alpha receptor associated factor 2.,"HIV-1 Nef is a virulence factor that plays multiple roles during HIV replication. Recently, it has been described that Nef intersects the CD40 signalling in macrophages, leading to modification in the pattern of secreted factors that appear able to recruit, activate and render T lymphocytes susceptible to HIV infection. The engagement of CD40 by CD40L induces the activation of different signalling cascades that require the recruitment of specific tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (i.e. TRAFs). We hypothesized that TRAFs might be involved in the rapid activation of NF-κB, MAPKs and IRF-3 that were previously described in Nef-treated macrophages to induce the synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and IFNβ to activate STAT1, -2 and -3."
7609079,Interactions of thyroid hormone receptor with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat and the HIV-1 Tat transactivator.,"Thyroid hormone (T3) receptor (T3R) regulates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) by binding to and activating thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) embedded within the viral NF-kappa B and Sp1 motifs. The TREs within the NF-kappa B sites are necessary for activation by T3 in the absence of Tat, while those in the Sp1 motifs function as TREs only when Tat is expressed, suggesting that Tat and T3R interact in the cell. Transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR by T3R alpha and several receptor mutants revealed that the 50-amino-acid N-terminal A/B region of T3R alpha, known to interact with the basal transcription factor TFIIB, is critical for activation of both Tat-dependent and Tat-independent responsive sequences of the LTR. A single amino acid change in the highly conserved tau 1 region in the ligand-binding domain of T3R alpha eliminates Tat-independent but not Tat-dependent activation of the HIV-1 LTR by T3. Ro 5-3335 [7-chloro-5-(2-pyrryl)-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2(H)-one], which inhibits Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV-1, also inhibits the functional interaction between Tat and T3R alpha. Binding studies with glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins and Western (immunoblot) analysis indicate that T3R alpha interacts with Tat through amino acids within the DNA-binding domain of T3R alpha. Mutational analysis revealed that amino acid residues in the basic and C-terminal regions of Tat are required for the binding of Tat to T3R alpha, while the N terminus of Tat is not required. These studies provide functional and physical evidence that stimulation of the HIV-1 LTR by T3 involves an interaction between T3R alpha and Tat. Our results also suggest a model in which multiple domains of T3R alpha interact with Tat and other factors to form transcriptionally important complexes."
8681387,Crystal structure of the conserved core of HIV-1 Nef complexed with a Src family SH3 domain.,"The crystal structure of the conserved core of HIV-1 Nef has been determined in complex with the SH3 domain of a mutant Fyn tyrosine kinase (a single amino acid substitution, Arg-96 to isoleucine), to which Nef binds tightly. The conserved PxxP sequence motif of Nef, known to be important for optimal viral replication, is part of a polyproline type II helix that engages the SH3 domain in a manner resembling closely the interaction of isolated peptides with SH3 domains. The Nef-SH3 structure also reveals how high affinity and specificity in the SH3 interaction is achieved by the presentation of the PxxP motif within the context of the folded structure of Nef."
9351809,The crystal structure of HIV-1 Nef protein bound to the Fyn kinase SH3 domain suggests a role for this complex in altered T cell receptor signaling.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Nef protein accelerates virulent progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) by its interaction with specific cellular proteins involved in signal transduction and host cell activation. Nef has been shown to bind specifically to a subset of the Src family of kinases. The structures of free Nef and Nef bound to Src homology region 3 (SH3) domain are important for the elucidation of how the affinity and specificity for the Src kinase family SH3 domains are achieved, and also for the development of potential drugs and vaccines against AIDS."
22944692,A catalogue of putative HIV-1 protease host cell substrates.,"Processing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proteins by the HIV-1 protease is essential for HIV infectivity. In addition, several studies have revealed cleavage of human proteins by this viral protease during infection; however, no large-scale HIV-1 protease degradomics study has yet been performed. To identify putative host substrates in an unbiased manner and on a proteome-wide scale, we used positional proteomics to identify peptides reporting protein processing by the HIV-1 protease, and a catalogue of over 120 cellular HIV-1 protease substrates processed in vitro was generated. This catalogue includes previously reported substrates as well as recently described interaction partners of HIV-1 proteins. Cleavage site alignments revealed a specificity profile in good correlation with previous studies, even though the ELLE consensus motif was not cleaved efficiently when incorporated into peptide substrates due to subsite cooperativity. Our results are further discussed in the context of HIV-1 infection and the complex substrate recognition by the viral protease."
8790371,Apoptosis mediated by HIV protease is preceded by cleavage of Bcl-2.,"Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) protease in cultured cells leads to apoptosis, preceded by cleavage of bcl-2, a key negative regulator of cell death. In contrast, a high level of bcl-2 protects cells in vitro and in vivo from the viral protease and prevents cell death following HIV infection of human lymphocytes, while reducing the yields of viral structural proteins, infectivity, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. We present a model for HIV replication in which the viral protease depletes the infected cells of bcl-2, leading to oxidative stress-dependent activation of NF kappa B, a cellular factor required for HIV transcription, and ultimately to cell death. Purified bcl-2 is cleaved by HIV protease between phenylalanine 112 and alanine 113. The results suggest a new option for HIV gene therapy; bcl-2 muteins that have noncleavable alterations surrounding the HIV protease cleavage site."
2017258,Processing of the precursor of NF-kappa B by the HIV-1 protease during acute infection.,"Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) genome is regulated in part by cellular factors and is stimulated by activation of latently infected T cells. T-cell activation also correlates with the induction of the factor NF-kappa B which binds to two adjacent sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. This factor consists of two DNA-binding subunits of relative molecular mass 50,000 (50K) associated with two 65K subunits. It is located in the nucleus in mature B cells, but is present in other cell types as an inactive cytoplasmic complex. External stimuli, including those that activate T cells, result in nuclear translocation of active NF-kappa B. The cloning of the complementary DNA for the 50K subunit helped to identify an exclusively cytoplasmic 105K precursor (p105) (V.B., P.K. and A.I., manuscript submitted). The expression of active NF-kappa B might therefore also be regulated by the extent of processing of p105. Because HIV-1 requires active NF-kappa B for efficient transcription, we tested the effect of HIV-1 infection on the processing of the human 105K precursor. We show here that the HIV-1 protease can process p105 and increases levels of active nuclear NF-kappa B complex."
15719057,SIRT1 regulates HIV transcription via Tat deacetylation.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Tat protein is acetylated by the transcriptional coactivator p300, a necessary step in Tat-mediated transactivation. We report here that Tat is deacetylated by human sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent class III protein deacetylase in vitro and in vivo. Tat and SIRT1 coimmunoprecipitate and synergistically activate the HIV promoter. Conversely, knockdown of SIRT1 via small interfering RNAs or treatment with a novel small molecule inhibitor of the SIRT1 deacetylase activity inhibit Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV long terminal repeat. Tat transactivation is defective in SIRT1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and can be rescued by expression of SIRT1. These results support a model in which cycles of Tat acetylation and deacetylation regulate HIV transcription. SIRT1 recycles Tat to its unacetylated form and acts as a transcriptional coactivator during Tat transactivation."
22174317,Host cell interactome of HIV-1 Rev includes RNA helicases involved in multiple facets of virus production.,"The HIV-1 Rev protein plays a key role in the late phase of virus replication. It binds to the Rev Response Element found in underspliced HIV mRNAs, and drives their nuclear export by the CRM1 receptor pathway. Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that Rev has additional functions in viral replication. Here we employed proteomics and statistical analysis to identify candidate host cell factors that interact with Rev. For this we studied Rev complexes assembled in vitro with nuclear or cytosolic extracts under conditions emulating various intracellular environments of Rev. We ranked the protein-protein interactions by combining several statistical features derived from pairwise comparison of conditions in which the abundance of the binding partners changed. As a validation set, we selected the eight DEAD/H box proteins of the RNA helicase family from the top-ranking 5% of the proteins. These proteins all associate with ectopically expressed Rev in immunoprecipitates of cultured cells. From gene knockdown approaches, our work in combination with previous studies indicates that six of the eight DEAD/H proteins are linked to HIV production in our cell model. In a more detailed analysis of infected cells where either DDX3X, DDX5, DDX17, or DDX21 was silenced, we observed distinctive phenotypes for multiple replication features, variously involving virus particle release, the levels of unspliced and spliced HIV mRNAs, and the nuclear and cytoplasmic concentrations of these transcripts. Altogether the work indicates that our top-scoring data set is enriched in Rev-interacting proteins relevant to HIV replication. Our more detailed analysis of several Rev-interacting DEAD proteins suggests a complex set of functions for the helicases in regulation of HIV mRNAs. The strategy used here for identifying Rev interaction partners should prove effective for analyzing other viral and cellular proteins."
20133788,Transcriptional coactivator HCF-1 couples the histone chaperone Asf1b to HSV-1 DNA replication components.,"The cellular transcriptional coactivator HCF-1 interacts with numerous transcription factors as well as other coactivators and is a component of multiple chromatin modulation complexes. The protein is essential for the expression of the immediate early genes of both herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus and functions, in part, by coupling chromatin modification components including the Set1 or MLL1 histone methyltransferases and the histone demethylase LSD1 to promote the installation of positive chromatin marks and the activation of viral immediately early gene transcription. Although studies have investigated the role of HCF-1 in both cellular and viral transcription, little is known about other processes that the protein may be involved in. Here we demonstrate that HCF-1 localizes to sites of HSV replication late in infection. HCF-1 interacts directly and simultaneously with both HSV DNA replication proteins and the cellular histone chaperone Asf1b, a protein that regulates the progression of cellular DNA replication forks via chromatin reorganization. Asf1b localizes with HCF-1 in viral replication foci and depletion of Asf1b results in significantly reduced viral DNA accumulation. The results support a model in which the transcriptional coactivator HCF-1 is a component of the HSV DNA replication assembly and promotes viral DNA replication by coupling Asf1b to DNA replication components. This coupling provides a novel function for HCF-1 and insights into the mechanisms of modulating chromatin during DNA replication."
16537602,State and role of SRC family kinases in replication of herpes simplex virus 1.,"An earlier report showed that infected cell protein no. 0 (ICP0) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) interacts with the SH3 domains of a recently discovered adaptor protein, CIN85. Here, we report the following. (i) ICP0 also interacts with other SH3 domain-containing proteins and, in particular, with nonneuronal members of the Src kinase family. (ii) HSV-1 infection enhanced the activating phosphorylation of Tyr416 of the members of the Src kinase family, modestly enhanced the kinase activity of Src, and posttranslationally modified at least one additional member of the Src kinase family by phosphorylation in a manner dependent on the viral gene products ICP0, unique short 3 (U(S)3), and unique long 13 (U(L)13). (iii) To define the roles of Src kinase family members, we examined the accumulation of viral proteins, DNA, and mRNA and virus yields from wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts and sibling cells lacking Src, Fyn, and Yes (SYF-); a mutant cell line, +Src, in which Src was restored to SYF- cells; and the mutant cell line (CSK-) lacking the negative regulator Csk gene of the Src kinase family. Representative alpha, beta, and gamma2 proteins accumulated in the largest amounts in SYF- cells and the smallest amounts in +Src compared to wild-type cells. The CSK- cells yielded smaller amounts of the gamma2 protein and at least 10-fold less virus than wild-type cells. We conclude that HSV-1 proteins regulate the activities of Src family kinases to achieve optimal viral yields in the course of viral replication."
10353252,Mammalian Srb/Mediator complex is targeted by adenovirus E1A protein.,"Adenovirus E1A proteins prepare the host cell for viral replication, stimulating cell cycling and viral transcription through interactions with critical cellular regulatory proteins such as RB and CBP. Here we show that the E1A zinc-finger domain that is required to activate transcription of viral early genes binds to a host-cell multiprotein complex containing homologues of yeast Srb/Mediator proteins. This occurs through a stable interaction with the human homologue of Caenorhabditis elegans SUR-2, a protein required for many developmental processes in the nematode. This human Srb/Mediator complex stimulates transcription in vitro in response to both the E1A zinc-finger and the herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domains. Interaction with human Sur-2 is also required for transcription to be activated by the activation domain of a transcription factor of the ETS-family in response to activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase."
21248039,The herpes simplex virus immediate-early ubiquitin ligase ICP0 induces degradation of the ICP0 repressor protein E2FBP1.,"E2FBP1/hDRIL1, a DNA-binding A/T-rich interaction domain (ARID) family transcription factor, is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues and plays an essential role in maintaining the proliferation potential of passage-limited human fibroblasts by dissociating promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). This effect on PML-NBs is similar to that of viral immediate-early gene products, such as infected cellular protein 0 (ICP0) from human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), which also disrupts PML-NBs to override the intrinsic cellular defense. Here we report that E2FBP1 inhibits accumulation of ICP0 RNA and, at the same time, is degraded via ICP0's herpes ubiquitin ligase 2 (HUL-2) activity upon HSV-1 infection. These reciprocal regulatory roles of ICP0 and E2FBP1 are linked in an ARID-dependent fashion. Our results suggest that E2FBP1 functions as an intrinsic cellular defense factor in spite of its PML-NB dissociation function."
21228271,Heat shock protein 70 inhibits HIV-1 Vif-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of APOBEC3G.,"The cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G, which is incorporated into nascent virus particles, possesses potent antiviral activity and restricts Vif-deficient HIV-1 replication at the reverse transcription step through deamination-dependent and -independent effects. HIV-1 Vif counteracts the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G by inducing APOBEC3G polyubiquitination and its subsequent proteasomal degradation. In this study, we show that overexpression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) blocked the degradation of APOBEC3G in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by HIV-1 Vif, rendering the viral particles non-infectious. In addition, siRNA targeted knock-down of HSP70 expression enhanced the Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3G. A co-immunoprecipitation study revealed that overexpression of HSP70 inhibited APOBEC3G binding to HIV-1 Vif. Thus, we provide evidence for a host protein-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication in an APOBEC3G-dependent manner."
18418067,p14ARF is capable of promoting HIV-1 tat degradation.,"The p14(ARF) tumor suppressor functions as 'oncogenic checkpoint' that prevents unrestricted cellular proliferation in response to oncogenic signaling. Albeit, the major pathway through which ARF operates is the ARF-Mdm2-p53 axis, ARF directly binds to and inactivates transcription function of a number of DNA-bound activators. In the present study we show that p14(ARF) inhibits transcription activation of HIV-1 LTR promoter activity by Tat protein. Tat protein is a RNA-bound transcriptional activator whose function is strictly required for HIV-1 replication. We determined that p14(ARF) inhibits Tat transactivation of HIV-1 LTR by promoting Tat degradation via an ubiquitin-independent pathway."
21098020,"Expression of a protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor, cdNIPP1, increases CDK9 threonine 186 phosphorylation and inhibits HIV-1 transcription.","CDK9/cyclin T1, a key enzyme in HIV-1 transcription, is negatively regulated by 7SK RNA and the HEXIM1 protein. Dephosphorylation of CDK9 on Thr(186) by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in stress-induced cells or by protein phosphatase M1A in normally growing cells activates CDK9. Our previous studies showed that HIV-1 Tat protein binds to PP1 through the Tat Q(35)VCF(38) sequence, which is similar to the PP1-binding RVXF motif and that this interaction facilitates HIV-1 transcription. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of expression of the central domain of nuclear inhibitor of PP1 (cdNIPP1) in an engineered cell line and also when cdNIPP1 was expressed as part of HIV-1 pNL4-3 in place of nef. Stable expression of cdNIPP1 increased CDK9 phosphorylation on Thr(186) and the association of CDK9 with 7SK RNA. The stable expression of cdNIPP1 disrupted the interaction of Tat and PP1 and inhibited HIV-1 transcription. Expression of cdNIPP1 as a part of the HIV-1 genome inhibited HIV-1 replication. Our study provides a proof-of-concept for the future development of PP1-targeting compounds as inhibitors of HIV-1 replication."
22863293,Mapping the interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of HIV-1 viral protein U and human CD4 with NMR spectroscopy.,"Viral protein U (VpU) of HIV-1 plays an important role in downregulation of the main HIV-1 receptor CD4 from the surface of infected cells. Physical binding of VpU to newly synthesized CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum is an early step in a pathway leading to proteasomal degradation of CD4. In this study, regions in the cytoplasmic domain of VpU involved in CD4 binding were identified by NMR spectroscopy. Amino acids in both helices found in the cytoplasmic region of VpU in membrane-mimicking detergent micelles experience chemical shift perturbations upon binding to CD4, whereas amino acids between the two helices and at the C-terminus of VpU show no or only small changes, respectively. The topology of the complex was further studied with paramagnetic relaxation enhancement. Paramagnetic spin labels were attached at three sequence positions of a CD4 peptide comprising the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the receptor. VpU binds to a membrane-proximal region in the cytoplasmic domain of CD4."
9557739,"PITALRE, the catalytic subunit of TAK, is required for human immunodeficiency virus Tat transactivation in vivo.","The human cdc2-related kinase PITALRE is the catalytic component of TAK, the Tat-associated kinase. Previously, we have proposed that TAK is a cellular factor that mediates Tat transactivation function. Here we demonstrate that transient overexpression of PITALRE specifically squelches Tat-1 activation of both a transfected and an integrated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR), suggesting that PITALRE mediates Tat function as a multiprotein complex. A catalytic mutant of PITALRE, D167N, was found to be more efficient than wild-type PITALRE in squelching Tat transactivation. Neither wild-type PITALRE nor D167N was able to squelch transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia type 1 LTR by the Tax protein. Additionally, we show that artificial targeting of PITALRE to a nascent RNA element, in the absence of Tat, activated HIV-1 LTR expression. These results indicate that a PITALRE-containing complex mediates transactivation by Tat and suggest that Tat proteins function by localizing such a PITALRE-containing complex to the site of the transcribing provirus."
7809103,Phosphorylation negatively regulates the function of coactivator PC4.,"Human positive cofactor 4 (PC4) mediates activator-dependent transcription by RNA polymerase II, apparently through interactions with transcriptional activators and the basal transcription machinery. We report here that PC4 function is modulated by in vivo phosphorylation. Protein-protein interaction studies and in vitro transcription assays demonstrate that only the nonphosphorylated form of PC4 is functionally active. Although recombinant PC4 can be phosphorylated by casein kinase II and protein kinase C in vitro, mutational and mass spectrometric analyses suggest that the in vivo hyperphosphorylation of PC4 is mediated mainly by casein kinase II and restricted to an N-terminal serine-rich region. These observations provide one example of a transcriptional cofactor that is negatively regulated by casein kinase II phosphorylation."
14744133,NMR mapping of the HIV-1 Tat interaction surface of the KIX domain of the human coactivator CBP.,"Tat is required for the expression of the HIV-1 genome. HIV-1 Tat interacts with the human transcriptional coactivator and acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) via the KIX domain of CBP. Chemical shift perturbation mapping with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to identify the surface of human KIX that interacts with Tat. It was found that Tat binds to the c-Jun/MLL/Tax binding surface of KIX, as opposed to the CREB binding site. The results provide new insight into the molecular basis of the assembly of protein complexes involving p300/CBP and Tat during HIV gene expression."
22179613,Protein arginine methyltransferase 1-directed methylation of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus latency-associated nuclear antigen.,"The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is a multifunctional protein with roles in gene regulation and maintenance of viral latency. Post-translational modification of LANA is important for functional diversification. Here, we report that LANA is subject to arginine methylation by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 in vitro and in vivo. The major arginine methylation site in LANA was mapped to arginine 20. This site was mutated to either phenylalanine (bulky hydrophobic, constitutive methylated mimetic) or lysine (positively charged, non-arginine methylatable) residues. The significance of the methylation in LANA function was examined in both the isolated form and in the context of the viral genome through the generation of recombinant KSHV. In addition, authentic LANA binding sites on the KSHV episome in naturally infected cells were identified using a whole genome KSHV tiling array. Although mutation of the methylation site resulted in no significant difference in KSHV LANA subcellular localization, we found that the methylation mimetic mutation resulted in augmented histone binding in vitro and increased LANA occupancy at identified LANA target promoters in vivo. Moreover, a cell line carrying the methylation mimetic mutant KSHV showed reduced viral gene expression relative to controls both in latency and in the course of reactivation. These results suggest that residue 20 is important for modulation of a subset of LANA functions and properties of this residue, including the hydrophobic character induced by arginine methylation, may contribute to the observed effects."
21779164,SUMO pathway dependent recruitment of cellular repressors to herpes simplex virus type 1 genomes.,"Components of promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies (ND10) are recruited to sites associated with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genomes soon after they enter the nucleus. This cellular response is linked to intrinsic antiviral resistance and is counteracted by viral regulatory protein ICP0. We report that the SUMO interaction motifs of PML, Sp100 and hDaxx are required for recruitment of these repressive proteins to HSV-1 induced foci, which also contain SUMO conjugates and PIAS2β, a SUMO E3 ligase. SUMO modification of PML and elements of its tripartite motif (TRIM) are also required for recruitment in cells lacking endogenous PML. Mutants of PML isoform I and hDaxx that are not recruited to virus induced foci are unable to reproduce the repression of ICP0 null mutant HSV-1 infection mediated by their wild type counterparts. We conclude that recruitment of ND10 components to sites associated with HSV-1 genomes reflects a cellular defence against invading pathogen DNA that is regulated through the SUMO modification pathway."
19494339,Proteome analysis of Plasmodium falciparum extracellular secretory antigens at asexual blood stages reveals a cohort of proteins with possible roles in immune modulation and signaling.,"The highly co-evolved relationship of parasites and their hosts appears to include modulation of host immune signals, although the molecular mechanisms involved in the host-parasite interplay remain poorly understood. Characterization of these key genes and their cognate proteins related to the host-parasite interplay should lead to a better understanding of this intriguing biological phenomenon. The malaria agent Plasmodium falciparum is predicted to export a cohort of several hundred proteins to remodel the host erythrocyte. However, proteins actively exported by the asexual intracellular parasite beyond the host red blood cell membrane (before merozoite egress) have been poorly investigated so far. Here we used two complementary methodologies, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis/MS and LC-MS/MS, to examine the extracellular secreted antigens at asexual blood stages of P. falciparum. We identified 27 novel antigens exported by P. falciparum in the culture medium of which some showed clustering with highly polymorphic genes on chromosomes, suggesting that they may encode putative antigenic determinants of the parasite. Immunolocalization of four novel secreted proteins confirmed their export beyond the infected red blood cell membrane. Of these, preliminary functional characterization of two novel (Sel1 repeat-containing) parasite proteins, PfSEL1 and PfSEL2 revealed that they down-regulate expression of cell surface Notch signaling molecules in host cells. Also a novel protein kinase (PfEK) and a novel protein phosphatase (PfEP) were found to, respectively, phosphorylate/dephosphorylate parasite-specific proteins in the extracellular culture supernatant. Our study thus sheds new light on malaria parasite extracellular secreted antigens of which some may be essential for parasite development and could constitute promising new drug targets."
22115549,Streptomyces erythraeus trypsin inactivates α1-antitrypsin.,"Streptomyces erythraeus trypsin (SET) is a serine protease that is secreted extracellularly by S. erythraeus. We investigated the inhibitory effect of α(1)-antitrypsin on the catalytic activity of SET. Intriguingly, we found that SET is not inhibited by α(1)-antitrypsin. Our investigations into the molecular mechanism underlying this observation revealed that SET hydrolyzes the Met-Ser bond in the reaction center loop of α(1)-antitrypsin. However, SET somehow avoids entrapment by α(1)-antitrypsin. We also confirmed that α(1)-antitrypsin loses its inhibitory activity after incubation with SET. Thus, our study demonstrates that SET is not only resistant to α(1)-antitrypsin but also inactivates α(1)-antitrypsin."
9491887,"A novel CDK9-associated C-type cyclin interacts directly with HIV-1 Tat and mediates its high-affinity, loop-specific binding to TAR RNA.","The HIV-1 Tat protein regulates transcription elongation through binding to the viral TAR RNA stem-loop structure. We have isolated a novel 87 kDa cyclin C-related protein (cyclin T) that interacts specifically with the transactivation domain of Tat. Cyclin T is a partner for CDK9, an RNAPII transcription elongation factor. Remarkably, the interaction of Tat with cyclin T strongly enhances the affinity and specificity of the Tat:TAR RNA interaction, and confers a requirement for sequences in the loop of TAR that are not recognized by Tat alone. Moreover, overexpression of human cyclin T rescues Tat activity in nonpermissive rodent cells. We propose that Tat directs cyclin T-CDK9 to RNAPII through cooperative binding to TAR RNA."
21632771,Herpes simplex virus immediate-early protein ICP0 is targeted by SIAH-1 for proteasomal degradation.,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) immediate-early protein ICP0 is a transcriptional activator with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that induces the degradation of ND10 proteins, including the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and Sp100. Moreover, ICP0 has a role in the derepression of viral genomes and in the modulation of the host interferon response to virus infection. Here, we report that ICP0 interacts with SIAH-1, a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase that is involved in multiple cellular pathways and is itself capable of mediating PML degradation. This novel virus-host interaction profoundly stabilized SIAH-1 and recruited this cellular E3 ligase into ICP0-containing nuclear bodies. Moreover, SIAH-1 mediated the polyubiquitination of HSV ICP0 in vitro and in vivo. After infection of SIAH-1 knockdown cells with HSV, higher levels of ICP0 were produced, ICP0 was less ubiquitinated, and the half-life of this multifunctional viral regulatory protein was increased. These results indicate an inhibitory role of SIAH-1 during lytic infection by targeting ICP0 for proteasomal degradation."
21149631,HIV-1 Vif promotes the G₁- to S-phase cell-cycle transition.,"HIV-1 depends on host-cell resources for replication, access to which may be limited to a particular phase of the cell cycle. The HIV-encoded proteins Vpr (viral protein R) and Vif (viral infectivity factor) arrest cells in the G₂ phase; however, alteration of other cell-cycle phases has not been reported. We show that Vif drives cells out of G₁ and into the S phase. The effect of Vif on the G₁- to-S transition is distinct from its effect on G₂, because G₂ arrest is Cullin5-dependent, whereas the G₁- to-S progression is Cullin5-independent. Using mass spectrometry, we identified 2 novel cellular partners of Vif, Brd4 and Cdk9, both of which are known to regulate cell-cycle progression. We confirmed the interaction of Vif and Cdk9 by immunoprecipitation and Western blot, and showed that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for Cdk9 inhibit the Vif-mediated G₁- to-S transition. These data suggest that Vif regulates early cell-cycle progression, with implications for infection and latency."
21071676,HIV-1 viral infectivity factor interacts with TP53 to induce G2 cell cycle arrest and positively regulate viral replication.,"Viral infectivity factor, an accessory protein encoded in the HIV-1 genome, induces G2 cell cycle arrest; however, the biological significance and mechanism(s) remain totally unclear. Here we demonstrate that the TP53 pathway is involved in Vif-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest. Vif enhances the stability and transcriptional activity of TP53 by blocking the MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and nuclear export of TP53. Furthermore, Vif causes G2 cell cycle arrest in a TP53-dependent manner. HXB2 Vif lacks these activities toward TP53 and cannot induce G2 cell cycle arrest. Using mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the critical residues for this function are located in the N-terminal region of Vif. Finally, we construct a mutant NL4-3 virus with an NL4-3/HXB2 chimeric Vif defective for the ability to induce cell cycle arrest and show that the mutant virus replicates less effectively than the wild-type NL4-3 virus in T cells expressing TP53. These data imply that Vif induces G2 cell cycle arrest through functional interaction with the TP53/MDM2 axis and that the G2 cell cycle arrest induced by Vif has a positive effect on HIV-1 replication. This report demonstrates the molecular mechanisms and the biological significance of Vif-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest for HIV-1 infection."
19923175,Evidence for an activation domain at the amino terminus of simian immunodeficiency virus Vpx.,"Vpx and Vpr are related lentiviral accessory proteins that enhance virus replication in macrophages and dendritic cells. Both proteins are packaged into virions and mediate their effects in the target cell through an interaction with an E3 ubiquitin ligase that contains DCAF1 and DDB1. When introduced into primary macrophages and dendritic cells in viruslike particles, Vpx can enhance the efficiency of a subsequent infection. Here, we confirm the ability of Vpx to enhance simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of macrophages up to 100-fold by using single-cycle reporter viruses and by pretreatment of the cells with Vpx-containing viruslike particles. Vpx was also active in differentiated THP-1 cells but not in other cell lines. Induction of an antiviral state in macrophages with type I interferon significantly magnified the effect of Vpx on HIV-1 infection, suggesting that Vpx helps the virus to overcome an inducible intracellular restriction. Quantitative PCR quantitation of SIV and HIV-1 reverse transcripts in newly infected macrophages showed that the block was at an early step in reverse transcription. In spite of its structural similarity, Vpr was inactive. This difference allowed us to map the functional domains of Vpx with a panel of Vpr/Vpx chimeras. Analysis of the chimeras demonstrated that the amino-terminal domain of Vpx is important for the enhancement of infection. Fine mapping of the region indicated that amino acids at positions 9, 12, and 15 to 17 were required. Although the mutants failed to enhance infection, they retained their ability to interact with DCAF1. These findings suggest that the Vpx amino terminus contains an activation domain that serves as the binding site for a cellular restriction factor."
22525270,A20/TNFAIP3 inhibits NF-κB activation induced by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus vFLIP oncoprotein.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) K13/vFLIP (viral Flice-inhibitory protein) induces transcription of numerous genes through NF-κB activation, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). In this study, we report that KSHV vFLIP induces the expression of the NF-κB regulatory proteins A20, ABIN-1 and ABIN-3 (A20-binding NF-κB inhibitors) in primary human endothelial cells, and that KS spindle cells express A20 in KS tissue. In reporter assays, A20 strongly impaired vFLIP-induced NF-κB activation in 293T cells, but ABIN-1 and ABIN-3 did not. Mutational analysis established that the C-terminal domain (residues 427-790) is critical for A20 modulation of NF-κB, but the ubiquitin-editing OTU (ovarian tumor) domain is not. In functional assays, A20 inhibited vFLIP-induced expression of the chemokine IP-10, reduced vFLIP-induced cell proliferation and increased IKK1 protein levels. Thus, we demonstrate that A20 negatively regulates NF-κB activation directly induced by KSHV vFLIP. By attenuating excessive and prolonged vFLIP-induced NF-κB activation that could be harmful to KSHV-infected cells, A20 likely has an important role in the pathogenesis of KSHV-associated diseases, in which vFLIP is expressed."
17069461,EC5S ubiquitin complex is recruited by KSHV latent antigen LANA for degradation of the VHL and p53 tumor suppressors.,"Cellular protein degradation pathways can be utilized by viruses to establish an environment that favors their propagation. Here we report that the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) directly functions as a component of the EC5S ubiquitin complex targeting the tumor suppressors von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and p53 for degradation. We have characterized a suppressor of cytokine signaling box-like motif within LANA composed of an Elongin B and C box and a Cullin box, which is spatially located at its amino and carboxyl termini. This motif is necessary for LANA interaction with the Cul5-Elongin BC complex, to promote polyubiquitylation of cellular substrates VHL and p53 in vitro via its amino- and carboxyl-terminal binding domain, respectively. In transfected cells as well as KSHV-infected B lymphoma cells, LANA expression stimulates degradation of VHL and p53. Additionally, specific RNA interference-mediated LANA knockdown stabilized VHL and p53 in primary effusion lymphoma cells. Thus, manipulation of tumor suppressors by LANA potentially provides a favorable environment for progression of KSHV-infected tumor cells."
22398289,SUMO binding by the Epstein-Barr virus protein kinase BGLF4 is crucial for BGLF4 function.,"An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein microarray was used to screen for proteins binding noncovalently to the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO2. Among the 11 SUMO binding proteins identified was the conserved protein kinase BGLF4. The mutation of potential SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) in BGLF4 identified N- and C-terminal SIMs. The mutation of both SIMs changed the intracellular localization of BGLF4 from nuclear to cytoplasmic, while BGLF4 mutated in the N-terminal SIM remained predominantly nuclear. The mutation of the C-terminal SIM yielded an intermediate phenotype with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. The transfer of BGLF4 amino acids 342 to 359 to a nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged reporter protein led to the relocalization of the reporter to the cytoplasm. Thus, the C-terminal SIM lies adjacent to a nuclear export signal, and coordinated SUMO binding by the N- and C-terminal SIMs blocks export and allows the nuclear accumulation of BGLF4. The mutation of either SIM prevented SUMO binding in vitro. The ability of BGLF4 to abolish the SUMOylation of the EBV lytic cycle transactivator ZTA was dependent on both BGLF4 SUMO binding and BGLF4 kinase activity. The global profile of SUMOylated cell proteins was also suppressed by BGLF4 but not by the SIM or kinase-dead BGLF4 mutant. The effective BGLF4-mediated dispersion of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies was dependent on SUMO binding. The SUMO binding function of BGLF4 was also required to induce the cellular DNA damage response and to enhance the production of extracellular virus during EBV lytic replication. Thus, SUMO binding by BGLF4 modulates BGLF4 function and affects the efficiency of lytic EBV replication."
21279453,HIV-1 Vif interaction with APOBEC3 deaminases and its characterization by a new sensitive assay.,"The human APOBEC3 (A3) cytidine deaminases, such as APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F), are potent inhibitors of Vif-deficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 Vif (viral infectivity factor) binds A3 proteins and targets these proteins for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. As such, the therapeutic blockage of Vif-A3 interaction is predicted to stimulate natural antiviral activity by rescuing APOBEC expression and virion packaging. In this study, we describe a successful application of the Protein Fragment Complementation Assay (PCA) based on the enzyme TEM-1 β-lactamase to study Vif-A3 interactions. PCA is based on the interaction between two protein binding partners (e.g., Vif and A3G), which are fused to the two halves of a dissected marker protein (β-lactamase). Binding of the two partners reassembles β-lactamase and hence reconstitutes its activity. To validate our assay, we studied the effect of well-described Vif (DRMR, YRHHY) and A3G (D128K) mutations on the interaction between the two proteins. Additionally, we studied the interaction of human Vif with other members of the A3 family: A3F and APOBEC3C (A3C). Our results demonstrate the applicability of PCA as a simple and reliable technique for the assessment of Vif-A3 interactions. Furthermore, when compared with co-immunoprecipitation assays, PCA appeared to be a more sensitive technique for the quantitative assessment of Vif-A3 interactions. Thus, with our results, we conclude that PCA could be used to quantitatively study specific domains that may be involved in the interaction between Vif and APOBEC proteins."
18419775,Conserved and non-conserved features of HIV-1 and SIVagm Vif mediated suppression of APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases.,"Human cytidine deaminase APOBEC3C (A3C) acts as a potent inhibitor of SIVagm and can be regulated by both HIV-1 and SIVagm Vif. The mechanism by which Vif suppresses A3C is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that both HIV-1 and SIVagm Vif can act in a proteasome-dependent manner to overcome A3C. SIVagm Vif requires the Cullin5-ElonginB-ElonginC E3 ubiquitin ligase for the degradation of A3C as well as the suppression of its antiviral activity. Mutation of a residue critical for the species-specific recognition of human or monkey A3G by HIV-1 Vif or SIVagm Vif in A3C had little effect on HIV-1 or SIVagm Vif-mediated degradation of A3C. Although the amino-terminal region of A3G was not important for Vif-mediated degradation, the corresponding region in A3C was critical. A3C mutants that were competent for Vif binding but resistant to Vif-mediated degradation were identified. These data suggest that primate lentiviral Vif molecules have evolved to recognize multiple host APOBEC3 proteins through distinct mechanisms. However, Cul5-E3 ubiquitin ligase appears to be a common pathway hijacked by HIV-1 and SIV Vif to defeat APOBEC3 proteins. Furthermore, Vif and APOBEC3 binding is not sufficient for target protein degradation indicating an important but uncharacterized Vif function."
22875967,Herpes simplex virus 1 ubiquitin ligase ICP0 interacts with PML isoform I and induces its SUMO-independent degradation.,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) immediate-early protein ICP0 localizes to cellular structures known as promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies or ND10 and disrupts their integrity by inducing the degradation of PML. There are six PML isoforms with different C-terminal regions in ND10, of which PML isoform I (PML.I) is the most abundant. Depletion of all PML isoforms increases the plaque formation efficiency of ICP0-null mutant HSV-1, and reconstitution of expression of PML.I and PML.II partially reverses this improved replication. ICP0 also induces widespread degradation of SUMO-conjugated proteins during HSV-1 infection, and this activity is linked to its ability to counteract cellular intrinsic antiviral resistance. All PML isoforms are highly SUMO modified, and all such modified forms are sensitive to ICP0-mediated degradation. However, in contrast to the situation with the other isoforms, ICP0 also targets PML.I that is not modified by SUMO, and PML in general is degraded more rapidly than the bulk of other SUMO-modified proteins. We report here that ICP0 interacts with PML.I in both yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays. This interaction is dependent on PML.I isoform-specific sequences and the N-terminal half of ICP0 and is required for SUMO-modification-independent degradation of PML.I by ICP0. Degradation of the other PML isoforms by ICP0 was less efficient in cells specifically depleted of PML.I. Therefore, ICP0 has two distinct mechanisms of targeting PML: one dependent on SUMO modification and the other via SUMO-independent interaction with PML.I. We conclude that the ICP0-PML.I interaction reflects a countermeasure to PML-related antiviral restriction."
18590780,Identification of a novel higher molecular weight isoform of USP7/HAUSP that interacts with the Herpes simplex virus type-1 immediate early protein ICP0.,"The Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) regulatory protein ICP0, a RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, stimulates the onset of viral lytic replication and the reactivation of quiescent viral genomes from latency. Like many ubiquitin ligases ICP0 induces its own ubiquitination, a process that can lead to its proteasome-dependent degradation. ICP0 counteracts this activity by recruiting the cellular ubiquitin-specific protease USP7/HAUSP. Here we show that ICP0 can also interact with a previously unidentified isoform of USP7 (termed here USP7(beta)). This isoform is not a predominantly ubiquitinated, SUMO-modified, or phosphorylated species of USP7 but is constitutively expressed in a number of different cell types. Like USP7, USP7(beta) binds specifically to an electrophilic ubiquitin probe, indicating that it contains an accessible catalytic core with potential ubiquitin-protease activity. The interaction formed between ICP0 and USP7(beta) requires ICP0 to have an intact USP7-binding domain and results in its susceptibility to ICP0-mediated degradation during HSV-1 infection."
22993145,Overexpression of the ubiquitin-specific protease 7 resulting from transfection or mutations in the ICP0 binding site accelerates rather than depresses herpes simplex virus 1 gene expression.,"Earlier studies reported that ICP0, a key regulatory protein encoded by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), binds ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7). The fundamental conclusion of these studies is that depletion of USP7 destabilized ICP0, that ICP0 mediated the degradation of USP7, and that amino acid substitutions in ICP0 that abolished binding to USP7 significantly impaired the ability of HSV-1 to replicate. We show here that, indeed, depletion of USP7 leads to reduction of ICP0 and that USP7 is degraded in an ICP0-dependent manner. However, overexpression of USP7 or substitution in ICP0 of a single amino acid to abolish binding to USP7 accelerated the accumulation of viral mRNAs and proteins at early times after infection and had no deleterious effect on virus yields. A clue as to why USP7 is degraded emerged from the observation that, notwithstanding the accelerated expression of viral genes, the plaques formed by the mutant virus were very small, implying a defect in virus transmission from cell to cell."
15897453,"Components of the REST/CoREST/histone deacetylase repressor complex are disrupted, modified, and translocated in HSV-1-infected cells.","The infected cell protein (ICP)0 enables gene expression and the replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 in cells infected at low multiplicities and enhances the expression of genes introduced into cells by transfection or infection. We report that a short sequence of ICP0 is similar to a sequence in the amino terminus of CoREST, a corepressor that exists in complexes with the repressor REST and histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 or 2 to repress cellular gene expression. In wild-type-virus-infected cells, HDAC1 dissociates from the CoREST/REST complex, CoREST and HDAC1 are phosphorylated by a process mediated by viral protein kinases, and CoREST and HDAC1 are partially translocated to the cytoplasm. In cells infected with a virus mutant (DeltaICP4), in which ICP0 accumulates, but post-alpha gene expression is blocked, HDAC1 is dissociated from the CoREST/REST complex, but translocation to the cytoplasm does not occur. After infection with a mutant virus from which ICP0 is deleted, the complex remains intact, but, under conditions of productive infection, the complex is partially translocated to the cytoplasm. These results suggest that, at low multiplicities of infection, ICP0 blocks CoREST-mediated silencing of viral genes by dissociation of HDAC1, whereas subsequent modifications and translocation of the components of the complex are the functions of other viral gene products made later in infection."
15141006,CKII site in Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 2 controls binding to hSNF5/Ini1 and is important for growth transformation.,"Substitution mutagenesis of EBNA2 shows that its interaction with hSNF5/Ini1 involves two sites (286IPP and DQQ313), and a mutation at a CKII phosphorylation site (SS469) is essential for the interaction. An alanine substitution (SS469AA) prevents binding to EBNA2 and diminishes the growth-promotion potential of EBNA2 in the transcomplementation assay."
15574592,Phosphorylation of a novel SOCS-box regulates assembly of the HIV-1 Vif-Cul5 complex that promotes APOBEC3G degradation.,"HIV-1 Vif (viral infectivity factor) protein overcomes the antiviral activity of the DNA deaminase APOBEC3G by targeting it for proteasomal degradation. We report here that Vif targets APOBEC3G for degradation by forming an SCF-like E3 ubiquitin ligase containing Cullin 5 and Elongins B and C (Cul5-EloB-EloC) through a novel SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling)-box that binds EloC. Vif binding to EloC is negatively regulated by serine phosphorylation in the BC-box motif of the SOCS-box. Vif ubiquitination is promoted by Cul5 in vitro and in vivo, and requires an intact SOCS-box. Thus, autoubiquitination of Vif occurs within the assembled Vif-Cul5 complex, analogous to F-box proteins that are autoubiquitinated within their SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) complex. These findings suggest mechanisms that regulate the assembly and activity of Cul5 E3 complexes through phosphorylation or autoubiquitination of the SOCS-box protein, and identify interactions between Vif and host cell proteins that may be therapeutic targets."
16014920,Regulation of Apobec3F and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vif by Vif-Cul5-ElonB/C E3 ubiquitin ligase.,"The human cytidine deaminase Apobec3F (h-A3F), a protein related to the previously recognized antiviral factor Apobec3G (h-A3G), has antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that is suppressed by the viral protein Vif. The mechanism of HIV-1 Vif-mediated suppression of h-A3F is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that while h-A3F, like h-A3G, was able to suppress primate lentiviruses other than HIV-1 (simian immunodeficiency virus from African green monkeys [SIVagm] and Rhesus macaques [SIVmac]), the interaction between Vif proteins and h-A3F appeared to differ from that with h-A3G. H-A3F showed no change in its species specificity against HIV-1 or SIVagm Vif when a negatively charged amino acid was replaced with a lysine at position 128, a residue critical for h-A3G recognition by HIV-1 Vif. However, HIV-1 Vif, but not SIVagm Vif, was able to bind h-A3F and induce its polyubiquitination and degradation through the Cul5-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase. Interference with Cul5-E3 ligase function by depletion of Cul5, through RNA interference or overexpression of Cul5 mutants, blocked the ability of HIV-1 Vif to suppress h-A3F. A BC-box mutant of HIV-1 Vif that failed to recruit Cul5-E3 ligase but was still able to interact with h-A3F failed to suppress h-A3F. Interestingly, interference with Cul5-E3 ligase function or overexpression of h-A3F or h-A3G also increased the stability of HIV-1 Vif, suggesting that like the substrate molecules h-A3F and h-A3G, the substrate receptor protein Vif is itself also regulated by Cul5-E3 ligase. Our results indicate that Cul5-E3 ligase appears to be a common pathway hijacked by HIV-1 Vif to defeat both h-A3F and h-A3G. Developing inhibitors to disrupt the interaction between Vif and Cul5-E3 ligase could be therapeutically useful, allowing multiple host antiviral factors to suppress HIV-1."
14672928,Vif overcomes the innate antiviral activity of APOBEC3G by promoting its degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.,"Viruses must overcome diverse intracellular defense mechanisms to establish infection. The Vif (virion infectivity factor) protein of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) acts by overcoming the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G (CEM15), a cytidine deaminase that induces G to A hypermutation in newly synthesized viral DNA. In the absence of Vif, APOBEC3G incorporation into virions renders HIV-1 non-infectious. We report here that Vif counteracts the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G by targeting it for destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Vif forms a complex with APOBEC3G and enhances APOBEC3G ubiquitination, resulting in reduced steady-state APOBEC3G levels and a decrease in protein half-life. Furthermore, Vif-dependent degradation of APOBEC3G is blocked by proteasome inhibitors or ubiquitin mutant K48R. A mutation of highly conserved cysteines or the deletion of a conserved SLQ(Y/F)LA motif in Vif results in mutants that fail to induce APOBEC3G degradation and produce non-infectious HIV-1; however, mutations of conserved phosphorylation sites in Vif that impair viral replication do not affect APOBEC3G degradation, suggesting that Vif is important for other functions in addition to inducing proteasomal degradation of APOBEC3G. Vif is monoubiquitinated in the absence of APOBEC3G but is polyubiquitinated and rapidly degraded when APOBEC3G is coexpressed, suggesting that coexpression accelerates the degradation of both proteins. These results suggest that Vif functions by targeting APOBEC3G for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and implicate the proteasome as a site of dynamic interplay between microbial and cellular defenses."
15013426,The Vif protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is posttranslationally modified by ubiquitin.,"The viral infectivity factor (Vif), one of the six HIV-1 auxiliary genes, is absolutely necessary for productive infection in primary CD4-positive T lymphocytes and macrophages. Vif overcomes the antiviral function of the host factor APOBEC3G. To better understand this mechanism, it is of interest to characterize cellular proteins that interact with Vif and may regulate its function. Here, we show that Vif binds to hNedd4 and AIP4, two HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases. WW domains present in those HECT enzymes contribute to the binding of Vif. Moreover, the region of Vif, which includes amino acids 20-128 and interacts with the hNedd4 WW domains, does not contain proline-rich stretches. Lastly, we show that Vif undergoes post-translational modifications by addition of ubiquitin both in cells overexpressing Vif and in cells expressing HIV-1 provirus. Vif is mainly mono-ubiquitinated, a modification known to address the Gag precursor to the virus budding site."
22386056,HIV-2 viral protein X (Vpx) ubiquitination is dispensable for ubiquitin ligase interaction and effects on macrophage infection.,"HIV-2 Vpx, a virus-associated accessory protein, is critical for infection of non-dividing myeloid cells. To understand the function of Vpx ubiquitination, interaction with an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and ability to overcome an inhibition of reverse transcription, we analyzed Vpx lysine mutants for their function and replication capability in macrophages. Both Wt Vpx and Vpx TA (lysine-less Vpx) localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus in HeLa cells. All HIV-2 Vpx lysine mutants were functional in virion packaging. However, ubiquitination was absent with Vpx TA and Vpx K84A mutants, indicating a lack of ubiquitin on positions K68 and K77. Mutants Vpx K68A and K77A were unable to infect macrophages due to impaired reverse transcription from loss of interaction with the ubiquitin substrate receptor, DCAF1. Even though Vpx K84A lacked ubiquitination, it bound DCAF1, and infected macrophages comparable to Wt Vpx."
21504384,PU.1-dependent regulation of UCH L1 expression in B-lymphoma cells.,"Elevated levels of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH L1) have been detected in a variety of malignancies, and recent studies show the oncogenic capacity of overexpressed UCH L1 in vivo in animal models. Here we demonstrate that expression of endogenous UCH L1 is significantly higher in B-lymphoma cells than in transformed cells of epithelial and fibroblastic origin. The specific hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 induces UCH L1 expression through direct activation of the uch l1 promoter. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and direct mutagenesis we identified PU.1 binding sites on the uch l1 promoter, at least three of which are involved in this activation. We also show that the viral transcriptional co-activator EBNA2 dramatically increases PU.1-dependent up-regulation of endogenous UCH L1 expression. Finally, inhibition of PU.1 expression with specific shRNA resulted in reduction of UCH L1 mRNA and protein levels in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cells. We propose that the ubiquitin-editing enzyme UCH L1 is a multifunctional pro-oncogenic factor involved in development and progression of certain lymphoid malignancies, including EBV-associated lymphomas."
23797873,SET-domain bacterial effectors target heterochromatin protein 1 to activate host rDNA transcription.,"Transcription of rRNA genes (rDNAs) in the nucleolus is regulated by epigenetic chromatin modifications including histone H3 lysine (de)methylation. Here we show that LegAS4, a Legionella pneumophila type IV secretion system (TFSS) effector, is targeted to specific rDNA chromatin regions in the host nucleolus. LegAS4 promotes rDNA transcription, through its SET-domain (named after Drosophila Su(var)3-9, enhancer of zeste [E(z)], and trithorax [trx]) histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMTase) activity. LegAS4's association with rDNA chromatin is mediated by interaction with host HP1α/γ. L. pneumophila infection potently activates rDNA transcription in a TFSS-dependent manner. Other bacteria, including Bordetella bronchiseptica and Burkholderia thailandensis, also harbour nucleolus-localized LegAS4-like HKMTase effectors. The B. thailandensis type III effector BtSET promotes H3K4 methylation of rDNA chromatin, contributing to infection-induced rDNA transcription and bacterial intracellular replication. Thus, activation of host rDNA transcription might be a general bacterial virulence strategy."
23507139,The HBx protein of hepatitis B virus confers resistance against nucleolar stress and anti-cancer drug-induced p53 expression.,"The nucleolus is a stress sensor associated with cell cycle progression and a viral target. However, the role of the nucleolus during hepatitis B virus infection has not been studied. Here we show that under nucleolar stress, the HBx oncoprotein down-regulates p53 and p21(waf1) levels by disrupting the interaction between ribosomal protein L11 and MDM2. Further, HBx inhibited Act D-mediated down-regulation of proliferative factors such as c-Myc and cyclin E and revived RNA pol I-dependent transcription under these conditions. Importantly, HBx also countered the action of anticancer drug Paclitaxel suggesting its possible role in drug resistance. Thus, HBx not only can facilitate cell proliferation under stress conditions but can confer resistance against anticancer drugs."
18682563,Herpesvirus tegument protein activates NF-kappaB signaling through the TRAF6 adaptor protein.,"Viruses remodel the host cell to optimize their replication both by delivery of virion proteins into the cell and by de novo expression of viral proteins. The HSV particle contains several proteins that function to prepare the host cell for viral replication, including the VP16 transcriptional activator protein and virion host shutoff protein. HSV infection activates NF-kappaB pathways through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and non-TLR pathways, and NF-kappaB activity is required for efficient viral replication. In a screen of the HSV proteome, we observed that the HSV U(L)37 tegument protein activates NF-kappaB signaling in a TLR2-independent manner. Expression of U(L)37 in transfected cells leads to IkappaB degradation and activation of both reporter genes and the endogenous IL-8 gene. This activation requires TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and U(L)37 contains a TRAF6-binding domain that is required for interaction with TRAF6 and activation of NF-kappaB. A mutant virus encoding U(L)37 with an altered TRAF6-binding site shows reduced NF-kappaB activation in the early phase of infection. Therefore, the HSV U(L)37 virion structural protein can activate NF-kappaB through TRAF6. Activation of NF-kappaB by a virion tegument protein that is delivered into the host cell cytoplasm during viral entry represents a mechanism for activation of this pathway by a virus."
24036449,Hepatitis B virus core protein interacts with CD59 to promote complement-mediated liver inflammation during chronic hepatitis B virus infection.,"The inflammatory response mediated by the immune system is the major cause of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver injury. Here, we identified CD59, as a novel HBc-interacting protein in hepatocytes by tandem affinity purification (TAP) screening. The expression of CD59 was markedly down-regulated in HBc-transfected HepG2 or HepG2.215 cells, which resulted in an upshift of hepatocyte sensitivity to membrane attack complex (MAC)-induced cell lysis. These results were consistent with the accumulation of MACs in the liver of HBV-infected patients. Additional analyses using laser confocal microscopy, quantitative PCR and flow cytometry revealed that CD59 was specifically translocated to the nucleus upon binding to HBc, which induced the down-regulation of CD59 on both the mRNA and protein levels."
24802111,Influenza A viral nucleoprotein interacts with cytoskeleton scaffolding protein α-actinin-4 for viral replication.,"Influenza A virus (IAV), similar to other viruses, exploits the machinery of human host cells for its survival and replication. We identified α-actinin-4, a host cytoskeletal protein, as an interacting partner of IAV nucleoprotein (NP). We confirmed this interaction using co-immunoprecipitation studies, first in a coupled in vitro transcription-translation assay and then in cells either transiently co-expressing the two proteins or infected with whole IAV. Importantly, the NP-actinin-4 interaction was observed in several IAV subtypes, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies revealed that both NP and actinin-4 co-localized largely around the nucleus and also in the cytoplasmic region of virus-infected A549 cells. Silencing of actinin-4 expression resulted in not only a significant decrease in NP, M2 and NS1 viral protein expression, but also a reduction of both NP mRNA and viral RNA levels, as well as viral titers, 24 h post-infection with IAV, suggesting that actinin-4 was critical for viral replication. Furthermore, actinin-4 depletion reduced the amount of NP localized in the nucleus. Treatment of infected cells with wortmannin, a known inhibitor of actinin-4, led to a decrease in NP mRNA levels and also caused the nuclear retention of NP, further strengthening our previous observations. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that actinin-4, a novel interacting partner of IAV NP, plays a crucial role in viral replication and this interaction may participate in nuclear localization of NP and/or viral ribonucleoproteins."
21450827,The cellular factors Vps18 and Mon2 are required for efficient production of infectious HIV-1 particles.,"Like all viruses, HIV-1 requires cellular host factors for replication. The mechanisms for production of progeny virions involving these host factors, however, are not fully understood. To better understand these mechanisms, we used a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genetic screen to identify mutant strains in which HIV-1 Gag targeting to the plasma membrane was aberrant. Of the 917 mutants identified, we selected 14 mutants whose missing genes had single orthologous counterparts in human and tested them for Gag-induced viruslike particle (VLP) release in yeast cells. We found that the Vps18 and Mon2 proteins were important for HIV-1 Gag-induced VLP release in yeast. In eukaryote cells, these host proteins are highly conserved and function in protein trafficking. Depletion of hVps18 or hMon2 reduced the efficient production of infectious HIV-1 virions in human cells. Our data suggest that these cellular factors play an important role in the efficient production of infectious HIV-1 virion particles."
21949651,A viral ubiquitin ligase has substrate preferential SUMO targeted ubiquitin ligase activity that counteracts intrinsic antiviral defence.,"Intrinsic antiviral resistance represents the first line of intracellular defence against virus infection. During herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection this response can lead to the repression of viral gene expression but is counteracted by the viral ubiquitin ligase ICP0. Here we address the mechanisms by which ICP0 overcomes this antiviral response. We report that ICP0 induces the widespread proteasome-dependent degradation of SUMO-conjugated proteins during infection and has properties related to those of cellular SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs). Mutation of putative SUMO interaction motifs within ICP0 not only affects its ability to degrade SUMO conjugates, but also its capacity to stimulate HSV-1 lytic infection and reactivation from quiescence. We demonstrate that in the absence of this viral countermeasure the SUMO conjugation pathway plays an important role in mediating intrinsic antiviral resistance and the repression of HSV-1 infection. Using PML as a model substrate, we found that whilst ICP0 preferentially targets SUMO-modified isoforms of PML for degradation, it also induces the degradation of PML isoform I in a SUMO modification-independent manner. PML was degraded by ICP0 more rapidly than the bulk of SUMO-modified proteins in general, implying that the identity of a SUMO-modified protein, as well as the presence of SUMO modification, is involved in ICP0 targeting. We conclude that ICP0 has dual targeting mechanisms involving both SUMO- and substrate-dependent targeting specificities in order to counteract intrinsic antiviral resistance to HSV-1 infection."
22438555,Functional characterization of residues required for the herpes simplex virus 1 E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP0 to interact with the cellular E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2D1 (UbcH5a).,"The viral ubiquitin ligase ICP0 is required for efficient initiation of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) lytic infection and productive reactivation of viral genomes from latency. ICP0 has been shown to target a number of specific cellular proteins for proteasome-dependent degradation during lytic infection, including the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and its small ubiquitin-like modified (SUMO) isoforms. We have shown previously that ICP0 can catalyze the formation of unanchored polyubiquitin chains and mediate the ubiquitination of specific substrate proteins in vitro in the presence of two E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, namely, UBE2D1 (UbcH5a) and UBE2E1 (UbcH6), in a RING finger-dependent manner. Using homology modeling in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis, we identify specific residues required for the interaction between the RING finger domain of ICP0 and UBE2D1, and we report that point mutations at these residues compromise the ability of ICP0 to induce the colocalization of conjugated ubiquitin and the degradation of PML and its SUMO-modified isoforms. Furthermore, we show that RING finger mutants that are unable to interact with UBE2D1 fail not only to complement the plaque-forming defect of an ICP0-null mutant virus but also to mediate the derepression of quiescent HSV-1 genomes in cell culture. These data demonstrate that the ability of ICP0 to interact with cellular E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes is fundamentally important for its biological functions during HSV-1 infection."
15781449,Ubiquitination of APOBEC3G by an HIV-1 Vif-Cullin5-Elongin B-Elongin C complex is essential for Vif function.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virion infectivity factor (Vif) overcomes the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G to protect HIV-1 DNA from G-to-A hypermutation. Vif targets APOBEC3G for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by forming an SCF-like E3 ubiquitin ligase complex composed of Cullin5, Elongin B, and Elongin C (Vif-BC-Cul5) through a novel SOCS-box motif. In this paper, we have established an in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assay with purified Vif-BC-Cul5 complex and reported that the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex could function as an E3 ligase for APOBEC3G in vitro. A Vif-BC-Cul5 complex promotes the in vitro ubiquitination of the wild type, APOBEC3G but not that of D128K mutant, which does not interact with Vif. We have also investigated several loss-of-function Vif mutants. One mutant, SLQ144/146AAA, lost its activity on APOBEC3G because it could not form a complex due to mutations in SOCS-box motif. Other mutants, C114S and C133S, also lost their activity because of loss of the E3 ligase activity of a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex, although these mutants retained the ability to bind to APOBEC3G as well as Cul5 complex. These findings suggest that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex is essential for Vif function against APOBEC3G."
19403673,Divergent Bro1 domains share the capacity to bind human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nucleocapsid and to enhance virus-like particle production.,"To promote the release of infectious virions, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exploits the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway by engaging Tsg101 and ALIX through late assembly (L) domains in p6 Gag. An LYPx(n)L motif in p6 serves as docking site for the central V domain of ALIX and is required for its ability to stimulate HIV-1 budding. Additionally, the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Gag binds to the N-terminal Bro1 domain of ALIX, which connects ALIX to the membrane-deforming ESCRT-III complex via its CHMP4 subunits. Since the isolated Bro1 domain of ALIX is sufficient to markedly stimulate virus-like particle (VLP) production in a minimal Gag rescue assay, we examined whether the Bro1 domains of other human proteins possess a similar activity. We now show that the Bro1 domain-only protein Brox and the isolated Bro1 domains of HD-PTP and rhophilin all bind to HIV-1 NC. Furthermore, all shared the capacity to stimulate VLP production by a minimal HIV-1 Gag molecule, and Brox in particular was as potent as the Bro1 domain of ALIX in this assay. Unexpectedly, Brox retained significant activity even if its CHMP4 binding site was disrupted. Thus, the ability to assist in VLP production may be an intrinsic property of the boomerang-shaped Bro1 domain."
23990779,Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus K-Rta exhibits SUMO-targeting ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) like activity and is essential for viral reactivation.,"The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a protein that regulates a wide variety of cellular processes by covalent attachment of SUMO moieties to a diverse array of target proteins. Sumoylation also plays an important role in the replication of many viruses. Previously, we showed that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a SUMO-ligase, K-bZIP, which catalyzes sumoylation of host and viral proteins. We report here that this virus also encodes a gene that functions as a SUMO-targeting ubiquitin-ligase (STUbL) which preferentially targets sumoylated proteins for degradation. K-Rta, the major transcriptional factor which turns on the entire lytic cycle, was recently found to have ubiquitin ligase activity toward a selected set of substrates. We show in this study that K-Rta contains multiple SIMs (SUMO interacting motif) and binds SUMOs with higher affinity toward SUMO-multimers. Like RNF4, the prototypic cellular STUbL, K-Rta degrades SUMO-2/3 and SUMO-2/3 modified proteins, including promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and K-bZIP. PML-NBs (nuclear bodies) or ND-10 are storage warehouses for sumoylated proteins, which negatively regulate herpesvirus infection, as part of the intrinsic immune response. Herpesviruses have evolved different ways to degrade or disperse PML bodies, and KSHV utilizes K-Rta to inhibit PML-NBs formation. This process depends on K-Rta's ability to bind SUMO, as a K-Rta SIM mutant does not effectively degrade PML. Mutations in the K-Rta Ring finger-like domain or SIM significantly inhibited K-Rta transactivation activity in reporter assays and in the course of viral reactivation. Finally, KSHV with a mutation in the Ring finger-like domain or SIM of K-Rta replicates poorly in culture, indicating that reducing SUMO-conjugates in host cells is important for viral replication. To our knowledge, this is the first virus which encodes both a SUMO ligase and a SUMO-targeting ubiquitin ligase that together may generate unique gene regulatory programs."
8194606,Identification of the U-937 membrane-associated proteinase interacting with the V3 loop of HIV-1 gp120 as cathepsin G.,"We have purified a serine proteinase from the membrane of U-937 cells that was inhibited in a tight-binding manner by recombinant gp120 and by peptides mimicking the V3 loop of gp120 [(1993) FEBS Lett. 317, 167-172]. This proteinase has now been characterized, both structurally and functionally. It has a dual trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like specificity, and N-terminal sequence analysis of the first 32 residues indicates complete identity with leukocyte cathepsin G. Cathepsin G-like material was located at the surface of U-937 cells using a monoclonal antibody directed against leukocyte cathepsin G, and polyclonal anti-cathepsin G antibodies precipitated the purified proteinase. However, the U-937 enzyme differs slightly from commercial leukocyte cathepsin G in its apparent M(r) because of different glycosylation. No other protein structurally related to cathepsin G was found upon screening a U-937 cDNA library using several oligonucleotide probes constructed from the membrane proteinase N-terminal amino acid sequence. The possible interaction of a cathepsin G-like proteinase at the surface of U-937 cells with the V3 loop of HIV-1 gp120 is discussed."
17440617,"ElaD, a Deubiquitinating protease expressed by E. coli.","Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) are designed to modify polypeptides in eukaryotes. Covalent binding of ubiquitin or Ubls to substrate proteins can be reversed by specific hydrolases. One particular set of cysteine proteases, the CE clan, which targets ubiquitin and Ubls, has homologs in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses."
11752173,Herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate-early protein ICP0 and is isolated RING finger domain act as ubiquitin E3 ligases in vitro.,"Proteasome-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins plays a key role in many important cellular processes. Ubiquitination requires the E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and frequently a substrate-specific ubiquitin protein ligase (E3). One class of E3 ubiquitin ligases has been shown to contain a common zinc-binding RING finger motif. We have previously shown that herpes simplex virus type 1 ICP0, itself a RING finger protein, induces the proteasome-dependent degradation of several cellular proteins and induces the accumulation of colocalizing conjugated ubiquitin in vivo. We now report that both full-length ICP0 and its isolated RING finger domain induce the accumulation of polyubiquitin chains in vitro in the presence of E1 and the E2 enzymes UbcH5a and UbcH6. Mutations within the RING finger region that abolish the in vitro ubiquitination activity also cause severe reductions in ICP0 activity in other assays. We conclude that ICP0 has the potential to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase during viral infection and to target specific cellular proteins for destruction by the 26S proteasome."
23288104,Mechanism of Rab1b deactivation by the Legionella pneumophila GAP LepB.,"Legionella pneumophila is an intracellularly surviving pathogen that releases about 270 different proteins into the host cell during infection. A set of secreted proteins takes control of the vesicular trafficking regulator Rab1. Legionella LepB inactivates Rab1 by acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). We present the crystal structure of the Rab1b:LepB complex together with a thorough biochemical analysis and show that the GAP domain of LepB consists of an unusual fold. LepB acts by an atypical RabGAP mechanism that is reminiscent of classical GAPs and therefore sets the protein apart from mammalian TBC-like GAPs. Surprisingly, LepB can function as a GAP for Rab3, Rab8, Rab13 and Rab35, too, suggesting that it has a broader cellular role than previously thought."
21450944,DNA-dependent protein kinase interacts functionally with the RNA polymerase II complex recruited at the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat and plays an important role in HIV gene expression.,"DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a nuclear protein kinase that specifically requires association with DNA for its kinase activity, plays important roles in the regulation of different DNA transactions, including transcription, replication and DNA repair, as well as in the maintenance of telomeres. Due to its large size, DNA-PK is also known to facilitate the activities of other factors by providing the docking platform at their site of action. In this study, by running several chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate the parallel distribution of DNA-PK with RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) along the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) provirus before and after activation with tumour necrosis factor alpha. The association between DNA-PK and RNAP II is also long-lasting, at least for up to 4 h (the duration analysed in this study). Knockdown of endogenous DNA-PK using specific small hairpin RNAs expressed from lentiviral vectors resulted in significant reduction in HIV gene expression and replication, demonstrating the importance of DNA-PK for HIV gene expression. Sequence analysis of the HIV-1 Tat protein revealed three potential target sites for phosphorylation by DNA-PK and, by using kinase assays, we confirmed that Tat is an effective substrate of DNA-PK. Through peptide mapping, we found that two of these three potential phosphorylation sites are recognized and phosphorylated by DNA-PK. Mutational studies on the DNA-PK target sites of Tat further demonstrated the functional significance of the Tat-DNA-PK interaction. Thus, overall our results clearly demonstrate the functional interaction between DNA-PK and RNAP II during HIV transcription."
23601700,In vitro reconstitution of complexes between pro-matrix metalloproteinase-9 and the proteoglycans serglycin and versican.,"Previously, we have shown that a proportion of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) synthesized by the macrophage cell line THP-1 binds to a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) core protein to form a reduction-sensitive heteromer. It was also shown that the hemopexin-like (PEX) domain and the fibronectin-like (FnII) module in the enzyme are involved in heteromer formation. In this paper, we show that reduction-sensitive and SDS-stable heteromers may be reconstituted in vitro by mixing proMMP-9 with either serglycin, versican or CSPGs isolated from various monocytic cell lines. In addition, a strong but SDS-soluble proMMP-9·CSPG heteromer was formed. The two macromolecules in the SDS-stable reduction-sensitive heteromers were not linked together by disulfide bonds. As for the heteromer isolated from THP-1 cells, in vitro reconstituted SDS-stable and SDS-soluble heteromers showed weaker binding to gelatin than the proMMP-9 monomer. Furthermore, gelatin inhibited in vitro reconstitution of the heteromers, showing that the FnII module is involved in the complex formation. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 was not be detected in the proMMP-9·CSPG complexes. However, the presence of TIMP-1 inhibited formation of the SDS-soluble heteromer, but not the SDS-stable reduction-sensitive heteromer. This indicates that different regions in the PEX domain are involved formation of these heteromers."
22514345,The ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 modulates the replication of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus latent episomal DNA.,"Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) belongs to the gamma-2 Herpesviridae and is associated with three neoplastic disorders: Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). The viral latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA) is expressed in all latently KSHV-infected cells and is involved in viral latent replication and maintenance of the viral genome. We show that LANA interacts with the ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 through its N-terminal TRAF (tumor necrosis factor [TNF] receptor-associated factor) domain. This interaction involves a short sequence (amino acids [aa] 971 to 986) within the C-terminal domain of LANA with strong similarities to the USP7 binding site of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA-1 protein. A LANA mutant with a deletion of the identified USP7 binding site showed an enhanced ability to replicate a plasmid containing the KSHV latent origin of replication but was comparable to the wild-type LANA (LANA WT) with regard to the regulation of viral and cellular promoters. Furthermore, the LANA homologues of two other gamma-2 herpesviruses, MHV68 and RRV, also recruit USP7. Our findings suggest that recruitment of USP7 to LANA could play a role in the regulation of viral latent replication. The recruitment of USP7, and its role in herpesvirus latent replication, previously described for the latent EBNA-1 protein of the gamma-1 herpesvirus (lymphocryptovirus) EBV (M. N. Holowaty et al., J. Biol. Chem. 278:29987-29994, 2003), may thereby be a conserved feature among gammaherpesvirus latent origin binding proteins."
22416134,Leucine zipper domain is required for Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) K-bZIP protein to interact with histone deacetylase and is important for KSHV replication.,"The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV; or human herpesvirus-8)-encoded protein called K-bZIP (also named K8) was found to be multifunctional. In this study, we discovered that K-bZIP interacts with histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1/2 in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated BCBL-1 lymphocyte cells. K-bZIP appears to repress HDAC activity through this interaction, which we determined to be independent of K-bZIP SUMOylation. We dissected the domains of K-bZIP and found that the leucine zipper (LZ) domain is essential for the interaction of K-bZIP and HDAC. In addition, we constructed a KSHV bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) with LZ domain-deleted K-bZIP (KSHVdLZ) and transfected this mutated KSHV BAC DNA into HEK 293T cells. As a result, it was consistently found that K-bZIP without its LZ domain failed to interact with HDAC2. We also showed that the interaction between K-bZIP and HDAC is necessary for the inhibition of the lytic gene promoters (ORF50 and OriLyt) of KSHV by K-bZIP. Furthermore, we found that the LZ domain is also important for the interaction of K-bZIP with the promoters of ORF50 and OriLyt. Most interestingly, although it was found to have suppressive effects on the promoters of ORF50 and OriLyt, KSHVdLZ replicates at a significantly lower level than its BAC-derived revertant (KSHVdLZRev) or KSHVWT (BAC36) in HEK 293T cells. The defectiveness of KSHVdLZ replication can be partially rescued by siRNA against HDAC2. Our results suggest that the function of K-bZIP interaction with HDAC is two-layered. 1) K-bZIP inhibits HDAC activity generally so that KSHVdLZ replicates at a lower level than does KSHVWT. 2) K-bZIP can recruit HDAC to the promoters of OriLyt and ORF50 through interaction with HDAC for K-bZIP to have a temporary repressive effect on the two promoters."
14668346,Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded vIRF-3 stimulates the transcriptional activity of cellular IRF-3 and IRF-7.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus has been linked to Kaposi's sarcoma, body cavity-based lymphoma, and Castleman's disease. The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus genome contains a cluster of open reading frames encoding proteins (vIRFs) with homology to the cellular transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factor family. vIRF-3, also called LANA2, is a latently expressed nuclear protein. Here we demonstrate that vIRF-3 directly interacts with cellular interferon regulatory factor (IRF) IRF-3, IRF-7, and the transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300. The mapping of the vIRF-3 binding domain revealed that vIRF-3 associates with both IRF-3 and IRF-7 through its C-terminal region. The p300 domain, which interacts with vIRF-3, is distinct from the previously identified IBiD domain, to which both vIRF-1 and IRF-3 bind. Thus, in contrast to vIRF-1, vIRF-3 neither blocks the interaction between IRF-3 and p300 nor inhibits the histone acetylation. Although vIRF-3 is not a DNA-binding protein, it is recruited to the IFNA promoters via its interaction with IRF-3 and IRF-7. The presence of vIRF-3 in the enhanceosome assembled on the IFNA promoters increases binding of IRF-3, IRF-7, and acetylated histone H3 to this promoter region. Consequently, vIRF-3 stimulates the IRF-3- and IRF-7-mediated activation of type I interferon (IFNA and IFNB) genes and the synthesis of biologically active type I interferons in infected B cells. These studies illustrate that vIRF-3 and vIRF-1 have clearly distinct functions. In addition to its co-repressor activity, vIRF-3 can also act as a transcriptional activator on genes controlled by cellular IRF-3 and IRF-7."
15467747,The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus K-bZIP protein represses transforming growth factor beta signaling through interaction with CREB-binding protein.,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is involved in the pathogenesis of KS, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. K-bZIP, the protein encoded by the open reading frame K8 of KSHV, is a member of the basic region-leucine zipper family of transcription factors. We studied the mechanisms that underlie KSHV-induced oncogenesis by investigating whether K-bZIP perturbs signaling through transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which inhibits proliferation of a wide range of cell types. K-bZIP repressed TGF-beta-induced, Smad-mediated transcriptional activity and antagonized the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. Since both K-bZIP and Smad are known to interact with CREB-binding protein (CBP), the effect of CBP on inhibition of Smad-mediated transcriptional activation by K-bZIP was examined. K-bZIP mutants, which lacked the CBP-binding site, could not repress TGF-beta-induced or Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Overexpression of CBP restored K-bZIP-induced inhibition of Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Competitive interaction studies showed that K-bZIP inhibited the interaction of Smad3 with CBP. These results suggest that K-bZIP, through its binding to CBP, disrupts TGF-beta signaling by interfering with the recruitment of CBP into transcription initiation complexes on TGF-beta-responsive elements. We propose a possibility that K-bZIP may contribute to oncogenesis through its ability to promote cell survival by repressing TGF-beta signaling."
21320693,Antiviral inhibition targeting the HCMV kinase pUL97 requires pUL27-dependent degradation of Tip60 acetyltransferase and cell-cycle arrest.,"Infection with the β-herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is lifelong, causing limited disease in healthy adults, but life threatening in immunocompromised individuals. The viral kinase pUL97, a functional ortholog of cellular cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), is critical for HCMV replication and a target for antiviral drug development. Upon kinase inhibition, drug-resistant strains emerge with mutations in UL27, an HCMV gene of unknown function. Using a proteomics approach, we discovered that pUL27 is necessary and sufficient to degrade Tip60, a host acetyltransferase and interacting partner of HIV Tat. Consistent with this, the expression of Tat restored antiviral inhibition of an otherwise resistant HCMV strain. The functional consequence of Tip60 degradation was the induction of the CDK inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1) and cell-cycle arrest, representing changes necessary for the antiviral effects of pUL97 inhibition. Consequently, either increasing p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression or decreasing Tip60 levels improved the antiviral activity of the HCMV kinase inhibitor maribavir."
18974867,Recruitment of the complete hTREX complex is required for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus intronless mRNA nuclear export and virus replication.,"A cellular pre-mRNA undergoes various post-transcriptional processing events, including capping, splicing and polyadenylation prior to nuclear export. Splicing is particularly important for mRNA nuclear export as two distinct multi-protein complexes, known as human TREX (hTREX) and the exon-junction complex (EJC), are recruited to the mRNA in a splicing-dependent manner. In contrast, a number of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic mRNAs lack introns and are exported by the virus-encoded ORF57 protein. Herein we show that ORF57 binds to intronless viral mRNAs and functions to recruit the complete hTREX complex, but not the EJC, in order assemble an export component viral ribonucleoprotein particle (vRNP). The formation of this vRNP is mediated by a direct interaction between ORF57 and the hTREX export adapter protein, Aly. Aly in turn interacts directly with the DEAD-box protein UAP56, which functions as a bridge to recruit the remaining hTREX proteins to the complex. Moreover, we show that a point mutation in ORF57 which disrupts the ORF57-Aly interaction leads to a failure in the ORF57-mediated recruitment of the entire hTREX complex to the intronless viral mRNA and inhibits the mRNAs subsequent nuclear export and virus replication. Furthermore, we have utilised a trans-dominant Aly mutant to prevent the assembly of the complete ORF57-hTREX complex; this results in a vRNP consisting of viral mRNA bound to ORF57, Aly and the nuclear export factor, TAP. Strikingly, although both the export adapter Aly and the export factor TAP were present on the viral mRNP, a dramatic decrease in intronless viral mRNA export and virus replication was observed in the absence of the remaining hTREX components (UAP56 and hTHO-complex). Together, these data provide the first direct evidence that the complete hTREX complex is essential for the export of KSHV intronless mRNAs and infectious virus production."
20682038,Herpes simplex virus UL56 interacts with and regulates the Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligase Itch.,"Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is one of many viruses that exploits and modifies the cellular ubiquitin system. HSV-2 expresses the tegument protein UL56 that has been implicated in cytoplasmic transport and/or release of virions, and is a putative regulatory protein of Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase. In order to elucidate the biological function of UL56, this study examined the interaction of UL56 with the Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligase Itch and its role in the regulation of Itch. Additionally, we assessed the similarity between UL56 and regulatory proteins of Itch and Nedd4, Nedd4-family-interactins proteins (Ndfip)."
23966401,Human cytomegalovirus UL76 elicits novel aggresome formation via interaction with S5a of the ubiquitin proteasome system.,"HCMV UL76 is a member of a conserved Herpesviridae protein family (Herpes_UL24) that is involved in viral production, latency, and reactivation. UL76 presents as globular aggresomes in the nuclei of transiently transfected cells. Bioinformatic analyses predict that UL76 has a propensity for aggregation and targets cellular proteins implicated in protein folding and ubiquitin-proteasome systems (UPS). Furthermore, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments suggests that UL76 reduces protein mobility in the aggresome, which indicates that UL76 elicits the aggregation of misfolded proteins. Moreover, in the absence of other viral proteins, UL76 interacts with S5a, which is a major receptor of polyubiquitinated proteins for UPS proteolysis via its conserved region and the von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain of S5a. We demonstrate that UL76 sequesters polyubiquitinated proteins and S5a to nuclear aggresomes in biological proximity. After knockdown of endogenous S5a by RNA interference techniques, the UL76 level was only minimally affected in transiently expressing cells. However, a significant reduction in the number of cells containing UL76 nuclear aggresomes was observed, which suggests that S5a may play a key role in aggresome formation. Moreover, we show that UL76 interacts with S5a in the late phase of viral infection and that knockdown of S5a hinders the development of both the replication compartment and the aggresome. In this study, we demonstrate that UL76 induces a novel nuclear aggresome, likely by subverting S5a of the UPS. Given that UL76 belongs to a conserved family, this underlying mechanism may be shared by all members of the Herpesviridae."
12036313,A protein phosphatase from human T cells augments tat transactivation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long-terminal repeat.,"HIV-1 Tat protein regulates viral gene expression by modulating the activity and association of cellular transcription factors with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Possible mechanisms include Tat-associated protein kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) that regulate phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNAPII. Hypophosphorylated RNAPII (RNAPIIa) is recruited to promoters during formation of a preinitiation complex, whereas hyperphosphorylated RNAPII (RNAPIIo) is associated with the elongation complex. The role of phosphatases in maintaining the equilibrium between the two phosphorylated states of RNAPII, which is required for sustained transcriptional activation from the HIV-1 LTR, is not clear. In this study, we discuss the properties of a Tat-associated CTD phosphatase fractionated from Jurkat T cells. The Tat-associated protein phosphatase (TAPP) is related to the serine/threonine, type 1, protein phosphatase (PP1) family. TAPP dephosphorylates the hyperphosphorylated form of recombinant CTD specifically on serine 2, and augments Tat-mediated transcriptional transactivation of HIV-1 LTR in an in vitro transcription reaction. TAPP is associated with the transcription complex during the early initiation steps, and its release from the HIV-1 promoter coincides with the Tat-specific activation of CDK9. The results suggest a unique role of the Tat-associated phosphatase which regulates viral transcription by target-specific dephosphorylation of RNAPII during the early stages of elongation."
12419264,The RTP site shared by the HIV-1 Tat protein and the 11S regulator subunit alpha is crucial for their effects on proteasome function including antigen processing.,"The human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein inhibits the peptidase activity of the 20S proteasome and competes with the 11S regulator/PA28 for binding to the 20S proteasome. Structural comparison revealed a common site in the Tat protein and the 11S regulator alpha-subunit (REGalpha) called the REG/Tat-proteasome-binding (RTP) site. Kinetic assays found amino acid residues Lys51, Arg52 and Asp67 forming the RTP site of Tat to be responsible for the effects on proteasomes in vitro. The RTP site identified in REGalpha consists of the residues Glu235, Lys236 and Lys239. Mutation of the REGalpha amino acid residues Glu235 and Lys236 to Ala resulted in an REGalpha mutant that lost the ability to activate the 20S proteasome even though it still forms complexes with REGbeta and binds to the 20S proteasome. The REGalpha RTP site is needed to enhance the presentation of a cytomegalovirus pp89 protein-derived epitope by MHC class I molecules in mouse fibroblasts. Cell experiments demonstrate that the Tat amino acid residues 37-72 are necessary for the interaction of the viral protein with proteasomes in vivo. Full-length Tat and the Tat peptide 37-72 suppressed 11S regulator-mediated presentation of the pp89 epitope. In contrast, the Tat peptide 37-72 with mutations of amino acid residues Lys51, Arg52 and Asp67 to Ala was not able to reduce antigen presentation."
11704662,Nuclear receptor coactivator p160 proteins enhance the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter by bridging promoter-bound factors and the Tat-P-TEFb complex.,"We report that p160 nuclear receptor coactivators potentiate the transactivating activity of Tat, the most potent virally encoded transactivator of HIV-1. One of the p160 proteins (GRIP1) is tethered to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) through kappaB-responsive elements, most likely via NF-kappaB, with which it also associates through its coactivator motifs (LXXLL motifs, ""NR boxes""). Indeed, the Tat-stimulated kappaB-defective HIV-1 LTR had a markedly impaired response to GRIP1, whereas NR box-defective GRIP1 proteins lost part of their Tat coactivator effect on the HIV-1 LTR. Through its N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix and C-terminal domains, GRIP1 binds to the N-terminal region of Tat and to the host cell protein cyclin T1, respectively, which is normally complexed with CDK9 as P-TEFb. Thus, NF-kappaB is crucial for tethering p160 coactivator molecules to the HIV-1 LTR, allowing full activation of this promoter by Tat. Interestingly, cotransfection of Tat, GRIP1, and cyclin T1 enhanced not only the activity of the HIV-1 LTR, but also the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated stimulation of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, suggesting that Tat can also attract the P-TEFb complex to the MMTV LTR through GRIP1. Thus, it appears that the coactivator complexes of the HIV-1 and MMTV LTRs both include p160 coactivators and use similar coactivator and elongation complexes for their transcription. Tat may function as an adaptor molecule, efficiently stimulating the processes of transcription initiation and elongation through potentiation of the coupling of p160 coactivators and the P-TEFb complex."
14592831,Thiol/disulfide exchange is a prerequisite for CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 envelope-mediated T-cell fusion during viral entry.,"Attachment of gp120 to CD4 during HIV-1 entry triggers structural rearrangement in gp120 that enables binding to an appropriate coreceptor. Following coreceptor engagement, additional conformational changes occur in the envelope (Env), resulting in fusion of virion and cell membranes. Catalysts with redox-isomerase activity, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), facilitate Env conversion from its inactive to its fusion-competent conformation. We report here that anti-PDI agents effectively block CXCR4 Env-mediated fusion and spread of virus infection. Exogenously added PDI, in turn, can rescue fusion from this blockade. We further find that PDI facilitates thiol/disulfide rearrangement in gp120 during conformational change, whereas inhibition of this redox shuffling prevents gp41 from assuming the fusogenic 6-helix bundle conformation. At the virus-cell contact site, gp120 induces assembly of PDI, CD4, and CXCR4 into a tetramolecular protein complex serving as a portal for viral entry. Our findings support the hypothesis that Env conformational change depends on a well-coordinated action of a tripartite system in which PDI works in concert with the receptor and the coreceptor to effectively lower the activation energy barrier required for Env conformational rearrangement."
23077308,Tsg101 interacts with herpes simplex virus 1 VP1/2 and is a substrate of VP1/2 ubiquitin-specific protease domain activity.,"Ubiquitination/deubiquitination of key factors represent crucial steps in the biogenesis of multivesicular body (MVB) and sorting of transmembrane proteins. We and others previously demonstrated that MVB is involved in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) envelopment and budding. Here, we report that the HSV-1 large tegument protein, VP1/2, interacts with and regulates the ubiquitination of Tsg101, a cellular protein essential in MVB formation, thus identifying the first cellular substrate of a herpesviral deubiquitinating enzyme."
22973040,The Vpx lentiviral accessory protein targets SAMHD1 for degradation in the nucleus.,"Sterile alpha motif domain- and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a deoxynucleoside triphosphohydrolase that restricts the replication of lentiviruses in myeloid cells by hydrolyzing the cellular deoxynucleotide triphosphates to a level below that which is required for reverse transcription. Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and some simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) encode the accessory protein viral protein X (Vpx) that counteracts SAMHD1. Vpx recruits SAMHD1 to a cullin4A-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4), which targets the enzyme for proteasomal degradation. Vpx and SAMHD1 both localize to the nucleus of the cell. We identified the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of SAMHD1 as a conserved KRPR sequence at amino acid residues 11 to 14. SAMHD1 lacking a functional NLS localized to the cytoplasm but retained its triphosphohydrolase and antiviral activities. However, cytoplasmic SAMHD1 was resistant to Vpx-induced degradation, and its antiviral activity was not counteracted by Vpx. Cytoplasmic SAMHD1 interacted with Vpx and retained it in the cytoplasm. The inhibition of nuclear export with leptomycin B did not impair the ability of Vpx to degrade SAMHD1. These findings suggest that SAMHD1 is targeted by Vpx for ubiquitination and degradation in the nucleus."
22776683,A novel DCAF1-binding motif required for Vpx-mediated degradation of nuclear SAMHD1 and Vpr-induced G2 arrest.,"HIV-2 and closely related SIV Vpx proteins are essential for viral replication in macrophages and dendritic cells. Vpx hijacks DCAF1-DDB1-Cul4 E3 ubiquitin ligase to promote viral replication. DCAF1 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development and is responsible for the polyubiquitination of poorly defined cellular proteins. How substrate receptors recruit the DCAF1-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce protein degradation is still poorly understood. Here we identify a highly conserved motif (Wx4Φx2Φx3AΦxH) that is present in diverse Vpx and Vpr proteins of primate lentiviruses. We demonstrate that the Wx4Φx2Φx3AΦxH motif in SIVmac Vpx is required for both the Vpx-DCAF1 interaction and/or Vpx-mediated degradation of SAMHD1. DCAF1-binding defective Vpx mutants also have impaired ability to promote SIVΔVpx virus infection of myeloid cells. Critical amino acids in the Wx4Φx2Φx3AΦxH motif of SIV Vpx that are important for DCAF1 interaction maintained the ability to bind SAMHD1, indicating that the DCAF1 and SAMHD1 interactions involve distinctive interfaces in Vpx. Surprisingly, VpxW24A mutant proteins that were still capable of binding DCAF1 and SAMHD1 lost the ability to induce SAMHD1 degradation, suggesting that Vpx is not a simple linker between the DCAF1-DDB1-Cul4 E3 ubiquitin ligase and its substrate, SAMHD1.VpxW24A maintained the ability to accumulate in the nucleus despite the fact that nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, mutant forms of SAMHD1 were more sensitive to Vpx-mediated degradation. The Wx4Φx2Φx3AΦxH motif in HIV-1 Vpr is also required for the Vpr-DCAF1 interaction and Vpr-induced G2 cell cycle arrest. Thus, our data reveal previously unrecognized functional interactions involved in the assembly of virally hijacked DCAF1-DDB1-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex."
22479537,The chromatin remodeling factor SMARCB1 forms a complex with human cytomegalovirus proteins UL114 and UL44.,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) uracil DNA glycosylase, UL114, is required for efficient viral DNA replication. Presumably, UL114 functions as a structural partner to other factors of the DNA-replication machinery and not as a DNA repair protein. UL114 binds UL44 (HCMV processivity factor) and UL54 (HCMV-DNA-polymerase). In the present study we have searched for cellular partners of UL114."
15713622,Displacement of SATB1-bound histone deacetylase 1 corepressor by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transactivator induces expression of interleukin-2 and its receptor in T cells.,"One hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the dysregulation of cytokine gene expression in T cells. Transfection of T cells with human T-cell leukemia type 1 or 2 transactivator results in the induction of the T-cell-restricted cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and its receptor (IL-2Ralpha). However, no T-cell-specific factor(s) has been directly linked with the regulation of IL-2 and IL-2Ralpha transcription by influencing the promoter activity. Thymocytes from SATB1 (special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1) knockout mice have been shown to ectopically express IL-2Ralpha, suggesting involvement of SATB1 in its negative regulation. Here we show that SATB1, a T-cell-specific global gene regulator, binds to the promoters of human IL-2 and IL-2Ralpha and recruits histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) in vivo. SATB1 also interacts with Tat in HIV-1-infected T cells. The functional interaction between HIV-1 Tat and SATB1 requires its PDZ-like domain, and the binding of the HDAC1 corepressor occurs through the same. Furthermore, Tat competitively displaces HDAC1 that is bound to SATB1, leading to increased acetylation of the promoters in vivo. Transduction with SATB1 interaction-deficient soluble Tat (Tat 40-72) and reporter assays using a transactivation-negative mutant (C22G) of Tat unequivocally demonstrated that the displacement of HDAC1 itself is sufficient for derepression of these promoters in vivo. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 Tat might overcome SATB1-mediated repression in T cells."
21167302,"Huwe1, a novel cellular interactor of Gag-Pol through integrase binding, negatively influences HIV-1 infectivity.","Integration, an indispensable step for retrovirus replication, is executed by integrase (IN), which is expressed as a part of a Gag-Pol precursor. Although mechanistic detail of the IN-catalyzed integration reaction is well defined, numerous evidence have demonstrated that IN is involved in multiple steps of retrovirus replication other than integration. In this study, Huwe1, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, was identified as a new cellular interactor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN. The interaction was mediated through the catalytic core domain of IN and a wide-range region of Huwe1. Interestingly, although depletion of Huwe1 in target cells did not affect the early phase of HIV-1 infection in a human T cell line, we found that infectivity of HIV-1 released from the Huwe1 knockdown cells was significantly augmented more than that of virus produced from control cells. The increase in infectivity occurred in proviral DNA synthesis. Further analysis revealed that Huwe1 interacted with HIV-1 Gag-Pol precursor protein through an IN domain. Our results suggest that Huwe1 in HIV-1 producer cells has a negative impact on early post-entry events during the next round of virus infection via association with an IN region of Gag-Pol."
15831937,"Epstein-Barr virus EBNA3 proteins bind to the C8/alpha7 subunit of the 20S proteasome and are degraded by 20S proteasomes in vitro, but are very stable in latently infected B cells.","A yeast two-hybrid screen using EBNA3C as bait revealed an interaction between this Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear protein and the C8 (alpha7) subunit of the human 20S proteasome. The interaction was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments and these also revealed that the related proteins EBNA3A and EBNA3B can bind similarly to C8/alpha7. The interaction between these viral proteins and GST-C8/alpha7 was shown to be significantly more robust than the previously reported interaction between C8/alpha7 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1). Co-immunoprecipitation of the EBNA3 proteins with C8/alpha7 was also demonstrated after transfection of expression vectors into B cells. Consistent with this ability to bind directly to an alpha-subunit of the 20S proteasome, EBNAs 3A, 3B and 3C were all degraded in vitro by purified 20S proteasomes. However, surprisingly, no sign of proteasome-mediated turnover of these latent viral proteins in EBV-immortalized B cells could be detected, even in the presence of gamma interferon. In actively proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines, EBNAs 3A, 3B and 3C appear to be remarkably stable, with no evidence of either de novo synthesis or proteasome-mediated degradation."
18256156,Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C interacts with and enhances the stability of the c-Myc oncoprotein.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the first human DNA virus to be associated with cancer. Its oncogenic potential was further demonstrated by its ability to transform primary B lymphocytes in vitro. EBV nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is one of a small subset of latent antigens critical for the transformation of human primary B lymphocytes. Although EBNA3C has been shown to modulate several cellular functions, additional targets involved in cellular transformation remain to be explored. EBNA3C can recruit key components of the SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase complex. In this report, we show that EBNA3C residues 130 to 190, previously shown to bind to the SCF(Skp2) complex, also can strongly associate with the c-Myc oncoprotein. Additionally, the interaction of EBNA3C with c-Myc was mapped to the region of c-Myc that includes the highly conserved Skp2 binding domain. Skp2 has been shown to regulate c-Myc stability and also has been shown to function as a coactivator of transcription for c-Myc target genes. We now show that the EBV latent oncoprotein EBNA3C can stabilize c-Myc and that the recruitment of both c-Myc and its cofactor Skp2 to c-Myc-dependent promoters can enhance c-Myc-dependent transcription. This same region of EBNA3C also recruits and modulates the activity of retinoblastoma and p27, both major regulators of the mammalian cell cycle. The inclusion of c-Myc in the group of cellular targets modulated by this domain further accentuates the importance of these critical residues of EBNA3C in bypassing the cell cycle checkpoints."
20929444,Decoding the intrinsic mechanism that prohibits ALIX interaction with ESCRT and viral proteins.,"The adaptor protein ALIX [ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked-gene-2 product)-interacting protein X] links retroviruses to ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery during retroviral budding. This function of ALIX requires its interaction with the ESCRT-III component CHMP4 (charged multivesicular body protein 4) at the N-terminal Bro1 domain and retroviral Gag proteins at the middle V domain. Since cytoplasmic or recombinant ALIX is unable to interact with CHMP4 or retroviral Gag proteins under non-denaturing conditions, we constructed ALIX truncations and mutations to define the intrinsic mechanism through which ALIX interactions with these partner proteins are prohibited. Our results demonstrate that an intramolecular interaction between Patch 2 in the Bro1 domain and the TSG101 (tumour susceptibility gene 101 protein)-docking site in the proline-rich domain locks ALIX into a closed conformation that renders ALIX unable to interact with CHMP4 and retroviral Gag proteins. Relieving the intramolecular interaction of ALIX, by ectopically expressing a binding partner for one of the intramolecular interaction sites or by deleting one of these sites, promotes ALIX interaction with these partner proteins and facilitates ALIX association with the membrane. Ectopic expression of a GFP (green fluorescent protein)-ALIX mutant with a constitutively open conformation, but not the wild-type protein, increases EIAV (equine infectious anaemia virus) budding from HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells. These findings predict that relieving the autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction of ALIX is a critical step for ALIX to participate in retroviral budding."
19282983,The nucleocapsid region of HIV-1 Gag cooperates with the PTAP and LYPXnL late domains to recruit the cellular machinery necessary for viral budding.,"HIV-1 release is mediated through two motifs in the p6 region of Gag, PTAP and LYPX(n)L, which recruit cellular proteins Tsg101 and Alix, respectively. The Nucleocapsid region of Gag (NC), which binds the Bro1 domain of Alix, also plays an important role in HIV-1 release, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that the first 202 residues of the Bro1 domain (Bro(i)) are sufficient to bind Gag. Bro(i) interferes with HIV-1 release in an NC-dependent manner and arrests viral budding at the plasma membrane. Similar interrupted budding structures are seen following over-expression of a fragment containing Bro1 with the adjacent V domain (Bro1-V). Although only Bro1-V contains binding determinants for CHMP4, both Bro(i) and Bro1-V inhibited release via both the PTAP/Tsg101 and the LYPX(n)L/Alix pathways, suggesting that they interfere with a key step in HIV-1 release. Remarkably, we found that over-expression of Bro1 rescued the release of HIV-1 lacking both L domains. This rescue required the N-terminal region of the NC domain in Gag and the CHMP4 binding site in Bro1. Interestingly, release defects due to mutations in NC that prevented Bro1 mediated rescue of virus egress were rescued by providing a link to the ESCRT machinery via Nedd4.2s over-expression. Our data support a model in which NC cooperates with PTAP in the recruitment of cellular proteins necessary for its L domain activity and binds the Bro1-CHMP4 complex required for LYPX(n)L-mediated budding."
18032513,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag engages the Bro1 domain of ALIX/AIP1 through the nucleocapsid.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other retroviruses harbor short peptide motifs in Gag that promote the release of infectious virions. These motifs, known as late assembly (L) domains, recruit a cellular budding machinery that is required for the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). The primary L domain of HIV-1 maps to a PTAP motif in the p6 region of Gag and engages the MVB pathway by binding to Tsg101. Additionally, HIV-1 p6 harbors an auxiliary L domain that binds to the V domain of ALIX, another component of the MVB pathway. We now show that ALIX also binds to the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of HIV-1 Gag and that ALIX and its isolated Bro1 domain can be specifically packaged into viral particles via NC. The interaction with ALIX depended on the zinc fingers of NC, which mediate the specific packaging of genomic viral RNA, but was not disrupted by nuclease treatment. We also observed that HIV-1 zinc finger mutants were defective for particle production and exhibited a similar defect in Gag processing as a PTAP deletion mutant. The effects of the zinc finger and PTAP mutations were not additive, suggesting a functional relationship between NC and p6. However, in contrast to the PTAP deletion mutant, the double mutants could not be rescued by overexpressing ALIX, further supporting the notion that NC plays a role in virus release."
2461565,Binding region for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and epitopes for HIV-blocking monoclonal antibodies of the CD4 molecule defined by site-directed mutagenesis.,"The binding region for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and epitopes for a panel of HIV-blocking anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies of the CD4 molecule were defined by using in vitro site-directed mutagenesis. Codons for two amino acid residues (Ser-Arg) were inserted at selected positions within the region encoding the first and second immunoglobulin-like domains of CD4. A vaccinia virus-based expression system was used to produce soluble full-length extracellular CD4 fragments containing the insertions. The mutant proteins were tested for direct binding to soluble gp120 (the CD4-binding subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein) and to a series of HIV-blocking anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies. Impaired gp120 binding activity resulted from insertions after amino acid residues 31, 44, 48, 52, 55, and 57 in the first immunoglobulin-like domain. The epitopes for two HIV-blocking monoclonal antibodies, OKT4A and OKT4D, were also mapped in the gp120-binding region in the first domain. Insertions after amino acid residues 21 and 91 in the first domain had no effect on gp120 binding but impaired the binding of OKT4E, suggesting that this antibody recognizes a discontinuous epitope not directly involved in gp120 binding. Moderate impairment of gp120 binding resulted from the insertion after amino acid residues 164 in the second immunoglobulin-like domain, where the epitopes for monoclonal antibodies MT151 and OKT4B were also mapped."
20164219,The interferon-induced gene ISG15 blocks retrovirus release from cells late in the budding process.,"The release of retroviruses from cells requires ubiquitination of Gag and recruitment of cellular proteins involved in endosome sorting, including the ESCRT-III proteins and the Vps4 ATPase. In response to infection, cells have evolved an interferon-induced mechanism to block virus replication through expression of the interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), a dimer homologue of ubiquitin, which interferes with ubiquitin pathways in cells. Previously, it has been reported that ISG15 expression inhibited the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4, and prevented association of the ESCRT-I protein Tsg101 with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag. The budding of avian sarcoma leukosis virus and HIV-1 Gag virus-like particles containing L-domain mutations can be rescued by fusion to ESCRT proteins, which cause entry into the budding pathway beyond these early steps. The release of these fusions from cells was susceptible to inhibition by ISG15, indicating that there was a block late in the budding process. We now demonstrate that the Vps4 protein does not associate with the avian sarcoma leukosis virus or the HIV-1 budding complexes when ISG15 is expressed. This is caused by a loss in interaction between Vps4 with its coactivator protein LIP5 needed to promote the formation of the ESCRT-III-Vps4 double-hexamer complex required for membrane scission and virus release. The inability of LIP5 to interact with Vps4 is the probable result of ISG15 conjugation to the ESCRT-III protein, CHMP5, which regulates the availability of LIP5. Thus, there appear to be multiple levels of ISG15-induced inhibition acting at different stages of the virus release process."
23071112,HIV-1 Nef impairs heterotrimeric G-protein signaling by targeting Gα(i2) for degradation through ubiquitination.,"The HIV Nef protein is an important pathogenic factor that modulates cell surface receptor trafficking and impairs cell motility, presumably by interfering at multiple steps with chemotactic receptor signaling. Here, we report that a dominant effect of Nef is to trigger AIP4 E3 ligase-mediated Gα(i2) ubiquitination, which leads to Gα(i2) endolysosomal sequestration and destruction. The loss of the Gα(i2) subunit was demonstrable in many cell types in the context of gene transfection, HIV infection, or Nef protein transduction. Nef directly interacts with Gα(i2) and ternary complexes containing AIP4, Nef, and Gα(i2) form. A substantial reversal of Gα(i2) loss and a partial recovery of impaired chemotaxis occurred following siRNA knockdown of AIP4 or NEDD4 or by inhibiting dynamin. The N-terminal myristoyl group, (62)EEEE(65) motif, and (72)PXXP(75) motif of Nef are critical for this effect to occur. Nef expression does not affect a Gq(i5) chimera where the five C-terminal residues of Gq are replaced with those of Gα(i2). Lysine at position 296 of Gα(i2) was identified as the critical determinant of Nef-induced degradation. By specifically degrading Gα(i2), Nef directly subverts leukocyte migration and homing. Impaired trafficking and homing of HIV Nef-expressing lymphocytes probably contributes to early immune dysfunction following HIV infection."
12021315,Modulation of human immunodeficiency virus 1 replication by interferon regulatory factors.,"Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is controlled by the cooperation of virally encoded and host regulatory proteins. The Tat protein is essential for viral replication, however, expression of Tat after virus entry requires HIV-1 promoter activation. A sequence in the 5' HIV-1 LTR, containing a binding site for transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factors (IRF) family has been suggested to be critical for HIV-1 transcription and replication. Here we show that IRF-1 activates HIV-1 LTR transcription in a dose-dependent fashion and in the absence of Tat. This has biological significance since IRF-1 is produced early upon virus entry, both in cell lines and in primary CD4+ T cells, and before expression of Tat. IRF-1 also cooperates with Tat in amplifying virus gene transcription and replication. This cooperation depends upon a physical interaction that is blocked by overexpression of IRF-8, the natural repressor of IRF-1, and, in turn is released by overexpression of IRF-1. These data suggest a key role of IRF-1 in the early phase of viral replication and/or during viral reactivation from latency, when viral transactivators are absent or present at very low levels, and suggest that the interplay between IRF-1 and IRF-8 may play a key role in virus latency."
18226242,The histone chaperone protein Nucleosome Assembly Protein-1 (hNAP-1) binds HIV-1 Tat and promotes viral transcription.,"Despite the large amount of data available on the molecular mechanisms that regulate HIV-1 transcription, crucial information is still lacking about the interplay between chromatin conformation and the events that regulate initiation and elongation of viral transcription. During transcriptional activation, histone acetyltransferases and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes cooperate with histone chaperones in altering chromatin structure. In particular, human Nucleosome Assembly Protein-1 (hNAP-1) is known to act as a histone chaperone that shuttles histones H2A/H2B into the nucleus, assembles nucleosomes and promotes chromatin fluidity, thereby affecting transcription of several cellular genes."
16889668,The integrase interactor 1 (INI1) proteins facilitate Tat-mediated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription.,"Integration of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into the host genome is catalyzed by the viral integrase (IN) and preferentially occurs within transcriptionally active genes. During the early phase of HIV-1 infection, the incoming viral preintegration complex (PIC) recruits the integrase interactor 1 (INI1)/hSNF5, a chromatin remodeling factor which directly binds to HIV-1 IN. The impact of this event on viral replication is so far unknown, although it has been hypothesized that it could tether the preintegration complex to transcriptionally active genes, thus contributing to the bias of HIV integration for these regions of the genome. Here, we demonstrate that while INI1 is dispensable for HIV-1 transduction, it can facilitate HIV-1 transcription by enhancing Tat function. INI1 bound to Tat and both the repeat (Rpt) 1 and Rpt 2 domains of INI1 were required for efficient activation of Tat-mediated transcription. These results suggest that the incoming PICs might recruit INI1 to facilitate proviral transcription."
9872325,Upregulation of cyclin T1/CDK9 complexes during T cell activation.,"Cyclin T1 has been identified recently as a regulatory subunit of CDK9 and as a component of the transcription elongation factor P-TEFb. Cyclin T1/CDK9 complexes phosphorylate the carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) in vitro. Here we report that the levels of cyclin T1 are dramatically upregulated by two independent signaling pathways triggered respectively by PMA and PHA in primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Activation of these two pathways in tandem is sufficient for PBLs to enter and progress through the cell cycle. However, the expression of cyclin T1 is not growth and/or cell cycle regulated in other cell types, indicating that regulation of cyclin T1 expression is dependent on tissue-specific signaling pathways. Upregulation of cyclin T1 in stimulated PBLs results in induction of the CTD kinase activity of the cyclin T1/CDK9 complex, which in turn correlates directly with phosphorylation of RNAP II in vivo, linking for the first time activation of the cyclin T1/ CDK9 pair with phosphorylation of RNAP II in vivo. In addition, we report here that endogenous CDK9 and cyclin T1 complexes associate with HIV-1 generated Tat in relevant cells and under physiological conditions (HIV-1 infected T cells). This, together with our results showing that HIV-1 replication in stimulated PBLs correlates with the levels of cyclin T1 protein and associated CTD kinase activity, suggests that the cyclin T1/CDK9 pair is one of the HIV-1 required host cellular cofactors generated during T cell activation."
22405594,Viral E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated degradation of a cellular E3: viral mimicry of a cellular phosphorylation mark targets the RNF8 FHA domain.,"Viral hijacking of cellular processes relies on the ability to mimic the structure or function of cellular proteins. Many viruses encode ubiquitin ligases to facilitate infection, although the mechanisms by which they select their substrates are often unknown. The Herpes Simplex Virus type-1-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase, ICP0, promotes infection through degradation of cellular proteins, including the DNA damage response E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168. Here we describe a mechanism by which this viral E3 hijacks a cellular phosphorylation-based targeting strategy to degrade RNF8. By mimicking a cellular phosphosite, ICP0 binds RNF8 via the RNF8 forkhead associated (FHA) domain. Phosphorylation of ICP0 T67 by CK1 recruits RNF8 for degradation and thereby promotes viral transcription, replication, and progeny production. We demonstrate that this mechanism may constitute a broader viral strategy to target other cellular factors, highlighting the importance of this region of the ICP0 protein in countering intrinsic antiviral defenses."
11830587,The human herpes virus 8-encoded viral FLICE inhibitory protein physically associates with and persistently activates the Ikappa B kinase complex.,"The human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8, also called Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) has been linked to Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) in immunocompromised individuals. We demonstrate that PEL cell lines have a constitutively active NF-kappaB pathway, which is associated with persistent phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. To elucidate the mechanism of NF-kappaB activation in PEL cell lines, we have investigated the role of viral FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP) in this process. We report that stable expression of HHV8 vFLIP in a variety of cell lines is associated with persistent NF-kappaB activation caused by constitutive phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. HHV8 vFLIP gets recruited to a approximately 700-kDa IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and physically associates with IKKalpha, IKKbeta, NEMO/IKKgamma, and RIP. HHV8 vFLIP is incapable of activating NF-kappaB in cells deficient in NEMO/IKKgamma, thereby suggesting an essential role of an intact IKK complex in this process. Our results suggest that HHV8 vFLIP might contribute to the persistent NF-kappaB activation observed in PEL cells by associating with and stimulating the activity of the cellular IKK complex."
21159881,Phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 are necessary for activation of NF-kappaB by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus G protein-coupled receptor.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) protein has been shown to induce several signaling pathways leading to the modulation of host gene expression. The hijacking of these pathways facilitates the viral life cycle and leads to tumorigenesis. In the present work, we show that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is an important player in NF-κB activation induced by vGPCR. We observed that the expression of an inactive TAK1 kinase mutant (TAK1M) reduces vGPCR-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Consequently, the expression of several NF-κB target genes normally induced by vGPCR was blocked by TAK1M expression, including interleukin 8 (IL-8), Gro1, IκBα, COX-2, cIAP2, and Bcl2 genes. Similar results were obtained after downregulation of TAK1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. The expression of vGPCR recruited TAK1 to the plasma membrane, and vGPCR interacts with TAK1. vGPCR expression also induced TAK1 phosphorylation and lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination, the two markers of the kinase's activation. Finally, inhibition of TAK1 by celastrol inhibited vGPCR-induced NF-κB activation, indicating this natural compound could be used as a potential therapeutic drug against KSHV malignancies involving vGPCR."
17686835,Intracellular trafficking and maturation of herpes simplex virus type 1 gB and virus egress require functional biogenesis of multivesicular bodies.,"The biogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) is topologically equivalent to virion budding. Hence, a number of viruses exploit the MVB pathway to build their envelope and exit from the cell. By expression of dominant negative forms of Vps4 and Vps24, two components of the MVB pathway, we observed an impairment in infectious herpes simplex virus (HSV) assembly/egress, in agreement with a recent report showing the involvement in HSV envelopment of Vps4, the MVB-specific ATPase (C. M. Crump, C. Yates, and T. Minson, J. Virol. 81:7380-7387). Furthermore, HSV infection resulted in morphological changes to MVBs. Glycoprotein B (gB), one of the most highly conserved glycoproteins across the Herpesviridae family, was sorted to MVB membranes. In cells expressing the dominant negative form of Vps4, the site of intracellular gB accumulation was altered; part of gB accumulated as an endoglycosidase H-sensitive immature form at a calreticulin-positive compartment, indicating that gB traffic was dependent on a functional MVB pathway. gB was ubiquitinated in both infected and transfected cells. Ubiquitination was in part dependent on ubiquitin lysine 63, a signal for cargo sorting to MVBs. Partial deletion of the gB cytoplasmic tail resulted in a dramatic reduction of ubiquitination, as well as of progeny virus assembly and release to the extracellular compartment. Thus, HSV envelopment/egress and gB intracellular trafficking are dependent on functional MVB biogenesis. Our data support the view that the sorting of gB to MVB membranes may represent a critical step in HSV envelopment and egress and that modified MVB membranes constitute a platform for HSV cytoplasmic envelopment or that MVB components are recruited to the site(s) of envelopment."
23938468,A proteomic perspective of inbuilt viral protein regulation: pUL46 tegument protein is targeted for degradation by ICP0 during herpes simplex virus type 1 infection.,"Much like the host cells they infect, viruses must also regulate their life cycles. Herpes simples virus type 1 (HSV-1), a prominent human pathogen, uses a promoter-rich genome in conjunction with multiple viral trans-activating factors. Following entry into host cells, the virion-associated outer tegument proteins pUL46 and pUL47 act to increase expression of viral immediate-early (α) genes, thereby helping initiate the infection life cycle. Because pUL46 has gone largely unstudied, we employed a hybrid mass spectrometry-based approach to determine how pUL46 exerts its functions during early stages of infection. For a spatio-temporal characterization of pUL46, time-lapse microscopy was performed in live cells to define its dynamic localization from 2 to 24 h postinfection. Next, pUL46-containing protein complexes were immunoaffinity purified during infection of human fibroblasts and analyzed by mass spectrometry to investigate virus-virus and virus-host interactions, as well as post-translational modifications. We demonstrated that pUL46 is heavily phosphorylated in at least 23 sites. One phosphorylation site matched the consensus 14-3-3 phospho-binding motif, consistent with our identification of 14-3-3 proteins and host and viral kinases as specific pUL46 interactions. Moreover, we determined that pUL46 specifically interacts with the viral E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP0. We demonstrated that pUL46 is partially degraded in a proteasome-mediated manner during infection, and that the catalytic activity of ICP0 is responsible for this degradation. This is the first evidence of a viral protein being targeted for degradation by another viral protein during HSV-1 infection. Together, these data indicate that pUL46 levels are tightly controlled and important for the temporal regulation of viral gene expression throughout the virus life cycle. The concept of a structural virion protein, pUL46, performing nonstructural roles is likely to reflect a theme common to many viruses, and a better understanding of these functions will be important for developing therapeutics."
15767397,ICP27 recruits Aly/REF but not TAP/NXF1 to herpes simplex virus type 1 transcription sites although TAP/NXF1 is required for ICP27 export.,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) protein ICP27 interacts with the cellular export adaptor protein Aly/REF, which is part of the exon junction complex implicated in cellular mRNA export. We previously reported that Aly/REF was no longer associated with splicing factor SC35 sites during infection but instead colocalized with ICP27 in distinct structures. Here we show that these structures colocalize with ICP4 and are sites of HSV-1 transcription. ICP27 mutants with lesions in the region required for the interaction with Aly/REF failed to recruit Aly/REF to viral transcription sites; however, ICP27 export to the cytoplasm was unimpaired, indicating that the interaction of ICP27 with Aly/REF is not required for ICP27 shuttling. ICP27 has also been shown to interact with the cellular mRNA export receptor TAP/NXF1. We report that ICP27 interacts directly with TAP/NXF1 and does not require Aly/REF to bridge the interaction. The C terminus of ICP27 is required; however, the N-terminal leucine-rich region also contributes to the interaction of ICP27 with TAP/NXF1. In contrast to the results found for Aly/REF, mutants that failed to interact with TAP/NXF1 were not exported to the cytoplasm, and TAP/NXF1 was not recruited to sites of HSV-1 transcription. Therefore, the interaction of ICP27 with TAP/NXF1 occurs after ICP27 leaves viral transcription sites. We conclude that ICP27 and the viral RNAs to which it binds are exported via the TAP/NXF1 export receptor."
18829761,Characterization of simian immunodeficiency virus SIVSM/human immunodeficiency virus type 2 Vpx function in human myeloid cells.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2)/simian immunodeficiency virus SIV(SM) Vpx is incorporated into virion particles and is thus present during the early steps of infection, when it has been reported to influence the nuclear import of viral DNA. We recently reported that Vpx promoted the accumulation of full-length viral DNA following the infection of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). This positive effect was exerted following the infection of DCs with cognate viruses and with retroviruses as divergent as HIV-1, feline immunodeficiency virus, and even murine leukemia virus, leading us to suggest that Vpx counteracted an antiviral restriction present in DCs. Here, we show that Vpx is required, albeit to a different extent, for the infection of all myeloid but not of lymphoid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and monocytoid THP-1 cells that had been induced to differentiate with phorbol esters. The intracellular localization of Vpx was highly heterogeneous and cell type dependent, since Vpx localized differently in HeLa cells and DCs. Despite these differences, no clear correlation between the functionality of Vpx and its intracellular localization could be drawn. As a first insight into its function, we determined that SIV(SM)/HIV-2 and SIV(RCM) Vpx proteins interact with the DCAF1 adaptor of the Cul4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex recently described to associate with HIV-1 Vpr and HIV-2 Vpx. However, the functionality of Vpx proteins in the infection of DCs did not strictly correlate with DCAF1 binding, and knockdown experiments failed to reveal a functional role for this association in differentiated THP-1 cells. Lastly, when transferred in the context of a replication-competent viral clone, Vpx was required for replication in DCs."
23988114,Interactions between HIV-1 Vif and human ElonginB-ElonginC are important for CBF-β binding to Vif.,"The HIV-1 accessory factor Vif is necessary for efficient viral infection in non-permissive cells. Vif antagonizes the antiviral activity of human cytidine deaminase APOBEC3 proteins that confer the non-permissive phenotype by tethering them (APOBEC3DE/3F/3G) to the Vif-CBF-β-ElonginB-ElonginC-Cullin5-Rbx (Vif-CBF-β-EloB-EloC-Cul5-Rbx) E3 complex to induce their proteasomal degradation. EloB and EloC were initially reported as positive regulatory subunits of the Elongin (SIII) complex. Thereafter, EloB and EloC were found to be components of Cul-E3 complexes, contributing to proteasomal degradation of specific substrates. CBF-β is a newly identified key regulator of Vif function, and more information is needed to further clarify its regulatory mechanism. Here, we comprehensively investigated the functions of EloB (together with EloC) in the Vif-CBF-β-Cul5 E3 ligase complex."
17869271,Characterization of a novel Cullin5 binding domain in HIV-1 Vif.,"Human immunodeficiency virus tyoe 1 (HIV-1) Vif counteracts host restriction cytidine deaminase (APOBEC3G) A3G by co-opting the cellular ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. Vif utilizes a viral-specific BC-box to recruit ElonginB-ElonginC and a novel zinc-binding HCCH motif to recruit Cullin5 (Cul5) to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting A3G for polyubiquitination and subsequently proteasomal degradation. To determine the structural requirements in HIV-1 Vif HCCH motif for Cul5 binding and Vif function, we investigated the arrangement of the His and Cys residues, the role of the spacing between them, and the requirement for the conserved residues. Our data demonstrate that exchanging Cys for His and vice versa in the highly conserved Zn-coordinating HCCH motif disrupted Vif function and interaction with Cul5. Moreover, the maintenance of both conserved residues and spacing within the HCCH motif is critical for Vif function. We have identified a ""viral Cul5 box"" with consensus Hx2YFxCFx4Phix2APhix7-8Cx5H that is required for Cul5 selection and subsequent A3G degradation. This novel motif may represent a potential new target for anti-viral drug development."
18562529,Structural insight into the human immunodeficiency virus Vif SOCS box and its role in human E3 ubiquitin ligase assembly.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virion infectivity factor (Vif) causes the proteasome-mediated destruction of human antiviral protein APOBEC3G by tethering it to a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of ElonginB, ElonginC, Cullin5, and Rbx2. It has been proposed that HIV Vif hijacks the E3 ligase through two regions within its C-terminal domain: a BC box region that interacts with ElonginC and a novel zinc finger motif that interacts with Cullin5. We have determined the crystal structure of the HIV Vif BC box in complex with human ElonginB and ElonginC. This complex presents direct structural evidence of the recruitment of a human ubiquitin ligase by a viral BC box protein that mimics the conserved interactions of cellular ubiquitin ligases. We further mutated conserved hydrophobic residues in a region downstream of the Vif BC box. These mutations demonstrate that this region, the Vif Cullin box, composes a third E3-ligase recruiting site critical for interaction between Vif and Cullin5. Furthermore, our homology modeling reveals that the Vif Cullin box and zinc finger motif may be positioned adjacent to the N terminus of Cullin5 for interaction with loop regions in the first cullin repeat of Cullin5."
17135358,Zinc chelation inhibits HIV Vif activity and liberates antiviral function of the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G.,"APOBEC3 proteins are cellular antiviral proteins that are targeted for proteasomal degradation by primate lentiviral Vif proteins. Vif acts as a substrate receptor for the Cullin5 (Cul5) E3 ubiquitin ligase, specifically interacting with Cul5 through a novel H-(x5)-C-(x17-18)-C-(x3-5)-H zinc binding motif. Using the membrane-permeable zinc chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), we demonstrated a requirement for zinc for Vif function in vivo. Treatment with TPEN at an IC50 of 1.79 microM inhibits Cul5 recruitment and APOBEC3G (A3G) degradation. Zinc chelation prevented Vif function in infectivity assays, allowing the virus to become sensitive to the antiviral activity of A3G. Zinc chelation had no effect on cellular Cul5-SOCS3 E3 ligase assembly, suggesting that zinc-dependent E3 ligase assembly may be unique to HIV-1 Vif, representing a new target for novel drug design."
15574593,Selective assembly of HIV-1 Vif-Cul5-ElonginB-ElonginC E3 ubiquitin ligase complex through a novel SOCS box and upstream cysteines.,"APOBEC3G, which induces hypermutations in newly synthesized viral DNA, is suppressed by HIV-1 Vif, acting through Cul5-ElonginB-ElonginC E3 ubiquitin ligase. We have now characterized a novel SOCS box in HIV-1 Vif that mediates its interaction with ElonginC. In this SOCS box, alanine replaces the consensus cysteine in the previously identified SOCS box. This new motif was necessary but insufficient for interaction with Cul5-ElonginB-ElonginC, as two highly conserved Cys residues outside the SOCS box were required to interact with Cul5 but not ElonginC. Therefore, selective assembly with Cul5 versus Cul2 E3 may require protein interfaces besides the SOCS-box-ElonginC interaction."
16530799,Assembly of HIV-1 Vif-Cul5 E3 ubiquitin ligase through a novel zinc-binding domain-stabilized hydrophobic interface in Vif.,"APOBEC3G (A3G) and related cytidine deaminases are potent inhibitors of retroviruses. HIV-1 Vif hijacks the cellular Cul5-E3 ubiquitin ligase to degrade APOBEC3 proteins and render them ineffective against these viruses. Here, we report that HIV-1 Vif is a novel zinc-binding protein containing an H-x(5)-C-x(17-18)-C-x(3-5)-H motif that is distinct from other recognized classes of zinc fingers. Zinc-binding stabilized a conserved hydrophobic interface within the HCCH motif that is critical for Vif-Cul5 E3 assembly and Vif function. An N-terminal region in the first Cullin repeat of Cul5, which is dispensable for adaptor ElonginC binding, was required for interaction with Vif. This region is the most divergent sequence between Cul2 and Cul5, a factor that may contribute to the selection of Cul5 and not Cul2 by Vif. This is the first example of a zinc-binding substrate receptor responsible for the assembly of a Cullin-RING ligase, representing a new target for antiviral development."
22190036,T-cell differentiation factor CBF-β regulates HIV-1 Vif-mediated evasion of host restriction.,"The human APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases are potent inhibitors of diverse retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 Vif forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with cullin 5 (CUL5), elongin B and elongin C , which promotes the polyubiquitination and degradation of APOBEC3 substrates. Here we demonstrate in human T cells that core binding factor β (CBF-β) is a key regulator of the evasion of HIV-1 from the host defence mediated by APOBEC3. CBF-β, the non-DNA-binding subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor, regulates the folding and DNA-binding activity of partner RUNX family proteins, which have important roles in the development and differentiation of diverse cell types, including T lymphocytes. In our study, knockdown of endogenous CBF-β blocked Vif-induced APOBEC3G polyubiquitination and degradation. CBF-β was not required for the interaction between Vif and APOBEC3G, yet was essential for the assembly of the Vif-CUL5 E3-ubiquitin-ligase complex. CBF-β proved to be a unique regulator of primate lentiviral Vif and not a general component of the CUL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase. We show that Vif and CBF-β physically interact, and that the amino-terminal region of Vif is required for this interaction. Furthermore, interactions with Vif required regions in CBF-β that are not involved in RUNX protein binding. Considering the importance of the interaction between Vif and CBF-β, disrupting this interaction represents an attractive pharmacological intervention against HIV-1."
23954291,"Influenza NS1 interacts with p53 and alters its binding to p53-responsive genes, in a promoter-dependent manner.","The interplay between influenza A viruses (IAV) and p53 has only been reported in a limited number of studies, mainly focusing on the antiviral role of p53. We investigated the impact of IAV infection on p53 stability and transcriptional activity. Our results indicate that IAV-induced stabilization of p53 only partially correlates with modulation of p53 transcriptional activity measured during infection. Moreover, we show that the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is able to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity, in a promoter-dependent manner. Based on these data, we propose that NS1 may contribute to p53-mediated cell fate decision during IAV infection."
24462683,Interaction between nucleophosmin and HBV core protein increases HBV capsid assembly.,"Host factors are involved in Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome replication and capsid formation during the viral life cycle. A host factor, nucleophosmin (B23), was found to bind to HBV core protein dimers, but its functional role has not been studied. This interaction promoted HBV capsid assembly and decreased the degree of capsid dissociation when subjected to denaturant treatments in vitro. In addition, inhibition of B23 reduced intracellular capsid formation resulting in a decrease of HBV production in HepG2.2.15 cells. These results provide important evidence that B23 acts on core capsid assembly via its interaction with HBV core dimers."
18552826,Capped small RNAs and MOV10 in human hepatitis delta virus replication.,"The evolutionary origin of human hepatitis delta virus (HDV) replication by RNA-directed transcription is unclear. Here we identify two species of 5'-capped, approximately 18-25-nucleotide small RNAs. One was of antigenomic polarity, corresponding to the 5' end of hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) mRNA, and interacted with HDAg and RNA polymerase II (Pol II), whereas the other mapped to a structurally analogous region on the genomic RNA hairpin. An HDAg-interaction screen indicated that HDAg interacts with MOV10, the human homolog of the Arabidopsis thaliana RNA amplification factor gene SDE3 and Drosophila melanogaster RISC-maturation factor gene Armitage (armi). MOV10 knockdown inhibited HDV replication, but not HDAg mRNA translation, further supporting a role for MOV10 in RNA-directed transcription. Together, our studies define RNA hairpins as critical elements for the initiation of HDV-related, RNA-directed transcription. The identification of capped small RNAs and the involvement of MOV10 in HDV replication further suggest a conserved mechanism related to RNA-directed transcription in lower eukaryotes."
14737186,HIV-1 Nef binds the DOCK2-ELMO1 complex to activate rac and inhibit lymphocyte chemotaxis.,"The infectious cycle of primate lentiviruses is intimately linked to interactions between cells of the immune system. Nef, a potent virulence factor, alters cellular environments to increase lentiviral replication in the host, yet the mechanisms underlying these effects have remained elusive. Since Nef likely functions as an adaptor protein, we exploited a proteomic approach to directly identify molecules that Nef targets to subvert the signaling machinery in T cells. We purified to near homogeneity a major Nef-associated protein complex from T cells and identified by mass spectroscopy its subunits as DOCK2-ELMO1, a key activator of Rac in antigen- and chemokine-initiated signaling pathways, and Rac. We show that Nef activates Rac in T cell lines and in primary T cells following infection with HIV-1 in the absence of antigenic stimuli. Nef activates Rac by binding the DOCK2-ELMO1 complex, and this interaction is linked to the abilities of Nef to inhibit chemotaxis and promote T cell activation. Our data indicate that Nef targets a critical switch that regulates Rac GTPases downstream of chemokine- and antigen-initiated signaling pathways. This interaction enables Nef to influence multiple aspects of T cell function and thus provides an important mechanism by which Nef impacts pathogenesis by primate lentiviruses."
23201263,Overexpression of inactive tetherin delGPI mutant inhibits HIV-1 Vpu-mediated antagonism of endogenous tetherin.,"Tetherin/BST-2/CD317 inhibits HIV-1 release from infected cells, but the viral Vpu protein efficiently antagonizes this antiviral activity through direct interaction between the transmembrane (TM) domains of each protein. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of an inactive tetherin delGPI mutant, the TM domain of which could competitively block Vpu targeting of endogenous tetherin, potently inhibited HIV-1 release from human tetherin-positive cells in both transient and stable expression conditions. These results also suggest that heterologous dimerization occurred between the delGPI mutant and endogenous tetherin. These findings suggest that blocking the Vpu/tetherin interface may be a novel therapeutic approach against HIV-1 release."
23722113,"Non-structural protein 1 of influenza viruses inhibits rapid mRNA degradation mediated by double-stranded RNA-binding protein, staufen1.","Although non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza viruses is not essential for virulence, this protein is involved in host-virus interactions, viral replication, and translation. In particular, NS1 is known to interact with the host protein, staufen1 (Stau1). This interaction is important for efficient viral replication. However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which NS1 influences the viral life cycle remains obscure. Here, we show using immunoprecipitation and artificial tethering that the N-terminus of NS1, NS1(1-73), interacts with Stau1, blocks the Stau1-Upf1 interaction, and consequently inhibits the efficiency of Stau1-mediated mRNA decay (SMD), but not nonsense-mediatedmRNA decay (NMD). The regulation of SMD efficiency by NS1 may contribute to building a more favorable cellular environment for viral replication."
22641034,Structural recognition mechanisms between human Src homology domain 3 (SH3) and ALG-2-interacting protein X (Alix).,"The functions of Src family kinases are tightly regulated through Src homology (SH) domain-mediated protein-protein interactions. We previously reported the biophysical characteristics of the apoptosis-linked gene 2-interacting protein X (Alix) in complex with the haemopoietic cell kinase (Hck) SH3 domain. In the current study, we have combined ITC, NMR, SAXS and molecular modeling to determine a 3D model of the complex. We demonstrate that Hck SH3 recognizes an extended linear proline-rich region of Alix. This particular binding mode enables Hck SH3 to sense a specific non-canonical residue situated in the SH3 RT-loop of the kinase. The resulting model helps clarify the mechanistic insights of Alix-Hck interaction."
12915535,Association of the herpes simplex virus type 1 Us11 gene product with the cellular kinesin light-chain-related protein PAT1 results in the redistribution of both polypeptides.,"The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) Us11 gene encodes a multifunctional double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding protein that is expressed late in infection and packaged into the tegument layer of the virus particle. As a tegument component, Us11 associates with nascent capsids after its synthesis late in the infectious cycle and is delivered into newly infected cells at times prior to the expression of viral genes. Us11 is also an abundant late protein that regulates translation through its association with host components and contains overlapping nucleolar retention and nuclear export signals, allowing its accumulation in both nucleoli and the cytosol. Thus, at various times during the viral life cycle and in different intracellular compartments, Us11 has the potential to execute discrete tasks. The analysis of these functions, however, is complicated by the fact that Us11 is not essential for viral replication in cultured cells. To discover new host targets for the Us11 protein, we searched for cellular proteins that interact with Us11 and have identified PAT1 as a Us11-binding protein according to multiple, independent experimental criteria. PAT1 binds microtubules, participates in amyloid precursor protein trafficking, and has homology to the kinesin light chain (KLC) in its carboxyl terminus. The carboxyl-terminal dsRNA-binding domain of Us11, which also contains the nucleolar retention and nuclear export signals, binds PAT1, whereas 149 residues derived from the KLC homology region of PAT1 are important for binding to Us11. Both PAT1 and Us11 colocalize within a perinuclear area in transiently transfected and HSV-1-infected cells. The 149 amino acids derived from the KLC homology region are required for colocalization of the two polypeptides. Furthermore, although PAT1 normally accumulates in the nuclear compartment, Us11 expression results in the exclusion of PAT1 from the nucleus and its accumulation in the perinuclear space. Similarly, Us11 does not accumulate in the nucleoli of infected cells that overexpress PAT1. These results establish that Us11 and PAT1 can associate, resulting in an altered subcellular distribution of both polypeptides. The association between PAT1, a cellular trafficking protein with homology to KLC, and Us11, along with a recent report demonstrating an interaction between Us11 and the ubiquitous kinesin heavy chain (R. J. Diefenbach et al., J. Virol. 76:3282-3291, 2002), suggests that these associations may be important for the intracellular movement of viral components."
14963118,Specificity of interaction of INI1/hSNF5 with retroviral integrases and its functional significance.,"Integrase interactor 1 (INI1)/hSNF5 is a host factor that directly interacts with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase and is incorporated into HIV-1 virions. Here, we show that while INI1/hSNF5 is completely absent from purified microvesicular fractions, it is specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virions with an integrase-to-INI1/hSNF5 stoichiometry of approximately 2:1 (molar ratio). In addition, we show that INI1/hSNF5 is not incorporated into related primate lentiviral and murine retroviral particles despite the abundance of the protein in producer cells. We have found that the specificity in incorporation of INI1/hSNF5 into HIV-1 virions is directly correlated with its ability to exclusively interact with HIV-1 integrase but not with other retroviral integrases. This specificity is also reflected in our finding that the transdominant mutant S6, harboring the minimal integrase interaction domain of INI1/hSNF5, blocks HIV-1 particle production but not that of the other retroviruses in 293T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that INI1/hNSF5 is a host factor restricted for HIV-1 and that S6 acts as a highly specific and potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication."
14581525,PPPYVEPTAP motif is the late domain of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Gag and mediates its functional interaction with cellular proteins Nedd4 and Tsg101 [corrected].,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Gag polyprotein contains two adjacent proline-rich motifs (sequence PPPYVEPTAP) in the C terminus of the matrix domain [corrected]. Proline-to-alanine mutations were introduced into either or both motifs of HTLV-1 to determine the effect on the release of HTLV-1 virus-like particles from 293T cells. The release of both single mutants was significantly reduced, whereas a double mutation in both motifs abolished the release of the HTLV-1 particles. Two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays showed that the HTLV-1 Gag polyprotein binds both Tsg101 and Nedd4 proteins. The interaction with HTLV-1 Gag required the central WW domain of Nedd4 and the ubiquitin enzyme variant (UEV) domain of Tsg101. We expressed various fragments of Nedd4 and Tsg101 proteins in 293T cells and tested for their ability to interfere with virion release mediated by the HTLV-1 Gag-Pro polyprotein. Fragments consisting of the N-terminal UEV domain of Tsg101 and the central WW and C-terminal Hect domains of Nedd4 protein all caused transdominant inhibition of HTLV-1 particle release. Similarly, inhibition of the proteasome significantly decreased HTLV-1 particle release. Furthermore, the WW domain overexpression caused an early arrest of HTLV-1 particle morphogenesis before the membrane is deformed into the typical half-shell structure. This result suggests that Nedd4 is involved early in budding of HTLV-1."
21424732,Host cell targets of tegument protein VP22 of herpes simplex virus 1.,"In the present study, seven novel host cell factors associated with VP22 were identified from the human leukocyte cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid high-throughput screening system. To confirm some of the interactions, VP22 and its homologues and two candidate targets were tagged with enhanced cyan or yellow fluorescent protein. While RING finger protein 10 (RNF10), WD repeat-containing protein 42A (WDR42A) or VP22 alone showed distinct subcellular localization patterns, RNF10 and WDR42A were relocated when co-expressed with VP22 or its homologues. Thus, these potential host cell factors of VP22 might expand the list of the host targets of VP22."
12076760,A mammalian two-hybrid screening system for inhibitors of interaction between HIV Nef and the cellular tyrosine kinase Hck.,"In the scope of the search for new anti-HIV agents interacting with a new target, we developed a high-throughput screening system to detect the interactions between Nef and Hck. Nef is an accessory protein of HIV, which is involved in the pathogenicity of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Nef is also a signaling molecule because it binds to many host molecules. It has especially high affinity to Hck, a member of src family tyrosine kinase. Using a mammalian two-hybrid system, the interaction between Nef and the SH3 domain of Hck induced luciferase activity with high sensitivity and a Nef-PXXP peptide inhibited this interaction; and so did the anticancer drug adriamycin. We also developed another assay system by coexpression of full-length Hck and Nef, and found that Hck kinase was activated depending on the dose of Nef plasmid. Using the second system, we found that adriamycin interfered with the Nef-Hck interaction by reducing the amount of the Hck protein. The mammalian two-hybrid system may show utility in screening inhibitors of Nef-Hck interaction."
1334459,"The BPV-1 E5 protein, the 16 kDa membrane pore-forming protein and the PDGF receptor exist in a complex that is dependent on hydrophobic transmembrane interactions.","The E5 oncoprotein of bovine papillomavirus type 1 is a 44 amino acid, highly hydrophobic protein that induces the stable transformation of immortalized murine fibroblasts, presumably through its activation of growth factor receptors. Previous studies have shown that the E5 protein complexes with the 16 kDa (16k) pore-forming protein of vacuolar H(+)-ATPases. This integral membrane protein is essential for the acidification and function of subcellular compartments that process growth factor receptors. Using an SV40 expression system in COS cells, we analyzed whether the E5-16k complexes bind additional cellular proteins, including growth factor receptors. These studies demonstrate that E5 binds to both the 16k protein and the PDGF receptor and that this tri-component complex can be isolated with antibodies specific for each protein. Importantly, the 16k protein bound to the PDGF receptor in the absence of E5, suggesting that E5 binds to the PDGF receptor via its interaction with the 16k protein. An E5 mutant lacking the hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids retained binding to both 16k and the PDGF receptor, indicating that E5 binds to these proteins through its hydrophobic, membrane-associating domain. These studies reveal that hydrophobic, intramembrane interactions govern the association of E5, 16k and the PDGF receptor, suggesting a ligand-independent mechanism for receptor activation and a potential link between receptor signal transduction pathways and membrane pore activity."
22345443,Live-cell imaging reveals multiple interactions between Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 and cellular chromatin during interphase and mitosis.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes a life-long latent infection in humans. In proliferating latently infected cells, EBV genomes persist as multiple episomes that undergo one DNA replication event per cell cycle and remain attached to the mitotic chromosomes. EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) binding to the episome and cellular genome is essential to ensure proper episome replication and segregation. However, the nature and regulation of EBNA-1 interaction with chromatin has not been clearly elucidated. This activity has been suggested to involve EBNA-1 binding to DNA, duplex RNA, and/or proteins. EBNA-1 binding protein 2 (EBP2), a nucleolar protein, has been proposed to act as a docking protein for EBNA-1 on mitotic chromosomes. However, there is no direct evidence thus far for EBP2 being associated with EBNA-1 during mitosis. By combining video microscopy and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy, we demonstrate here for the first time that EBNA-1 and EBP2 interact in the nucleoplasm, as well as in the nucleoli during interphase. However, in strong contrast to the current proposed model, we were unable to observe any interaction between EBNA-1 and EBP2 on mitotic chromosomes. We also performed a yeast double-hybrid screening, followed by a FRET analysis, that led us to identify HMGB2 (high-mobility group box 2), a well-known chromatin component, as a new partner for EBNA-1 on chromatin during interphase and mitosis. Although the depletion of HMGB2 partly altered EBNA-1 association with chromatin in HeLa cells during interphase and mitosis, it did not significantly impact the maintenance of EBV episomes in Raji cells."
23603391,NMR characterization of the interaction of GroEL with amyloid β as a model ligand.,"Here we report an NMR study on the substrate interaction modes of GroEL using amyloid β (Aβ) as a model ligand. We found that GroEL could suppress Aβ(1-40) amyloid formation by interacting with its two hydrophobic segments Leu17-Ala21 and Ala30-Val36, which involve key residues in fibril formation. The binding site of Aβ(1-40) was mapped on a pair of α-helices located in the GroEL apical domain. These results provide insights into chaperonin recognition of amyloidogenic proteins of pathological interest."
15321703,A novel assay to identify entry inhibitors that block binding of HIV-1 gp120 to CCR5.,"HIV-1 infection is initiated by the interaction of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 with the cellular receptor CD4 that triggers conformational changes in gp120 necessary for subsequent interaction with a coreceptor CCR5 (or CXCR4). The CD4-induced (CD4i) conformation of gp120 can be mimicked by a full-length single chain (FLSC) protein consisting of gp120 linked with the D1D2 domains of CD4 by a 20-amino-acid linker. We have used this protein to establish a flow cytometry-based assay and an ELISA-based assay to identify inhibitors that block the binding of gp120 to CCR5. Both assays are specific for detecting the known CCR5 antagonist TAK-779, but the ELISA-based assay was more sensitive, simple, inexpensive, and rapid; thus, it can be adapted to high throughput screening (HTS). The ELISA-based method was validated with a diverse set of known antagonists, for example, TAK-779, AOP-RANTES, PSC-RANTES, and several mAbs."
1605591,"Simple assay to screen for inhibitors of interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein and its cellular receptor, CD4.",The binding of the human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the CD4 molecule is the initial step in the viral replicative cycle. This interaction is therefore an important target for therapeutic intervention for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection. We designed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay which detects the interaction between recombinant soluble forms of CD4 and gp160. This assay could be used as an initial screen of libraries of synthetic chemical compounds and natural products.
12218052,Protein-disulfide isomerase-mediated reduction of two disulfide bonds of HIV envelope glycoprotein 120 occurs post-CXCR4 binding and is required for fusion.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope (Env) glycoprotein (gp) 120 is a highly disulfide-bonded molecule that attaches HIV to the lymphocyte surface receptors CD4 and CXCR4. Conformation changes within gp120 result from binding and trigger HIV/cell fusion. Inhibition of lymphocyte surface-associated protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) blocks HIV/cell fusion, suggesting that redox changes within Env are required. Using a sensitive assay based on a thiol reagent, we show that (i) the thiol content of gp120, either secreted by mammalian cells or bound to a lymphocyte surface enabling CD4 but not CXCR4 binding, was 0.5-1 pmol SH/pmol gp120 (SH/gp120), whereas that of gp120 after its interaction with a surface enabling both CD4 and CXCR4 binding was raised to 4 SH/gp120; (ii) PDI inhibitors prevented this change; and (iii) gp120 displaying 2 SH/gp120 exhibited CD4 but not CXCR4 binding capacity. In addition, PDI inhibition did not impair gp120 binding to receptors. We conclude that on average two of the nine disulfides of gp120 are reduced during interaction with the lymphocyte surface after CXCR4 binding prior to fusion and that cell surface PDI catalyzes this process. Disulfide bond restructuring within Env may constitute the molecular basis of the post-receptor binding conformational changes that induce fusion competence."
17690245,Conserved P-TEFb-interacting domain of BRD4 inhibits HIV transcription.,"We have identified a conserved region in the C-terminal domain of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) that mediates its specific interaction with positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). This domain is highly conserved in testis-specific bromodomain protein (BRDT) and Drosophila fs(1)h. Both BRDT and fs(1)h specifically interact with P-TEFb in mammalian cells, and this interaction depends on their C-terminal domains. Overexpression of the BRD4 P-TEFb-interacting domain disrupts the interaction between the HIV transactivator Tat and P-TEFb and suppresses the ability of Tat to transactivate the HIV promoter. Incubation of cells with a synthetic peptide containing the C-terminal domain of BRD4 interferes with transactivation of the HIV promoter by the Tat protein."
20463065,Dissection of the HIV Vif interaction with human E3 ubiquitin ligase.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protein Vif recruits the host E3 ubiquitin ligase, composed of cullin 5 (Cul5), Rbx2, Elongin B, and Elongin C (EloBC), to polyubiquitinate the antiviral protein APOBEC3G. Multiple regions in the C-terminal half of Vif interact with the E3 ligase. We have purified individual regions of Vif and investigated their thermodynamic contributions to the ligase assembly in vitro using isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence anisotropy. Our results quantify the high-affinity interactions between the Vif BC box and EloBC and between the Vif zinc finger and Cul5, as well as the modest interaction between the Vif cullin box and Cul5. Our purified Vif constructs also provide direct biochemical evidence that the Vif cullin box, containing the PPLP region, leads to the dimerization of Vif-EloBC complexes but not Cul5-Vif-EloBC complexes."
24225024,Insight into the HIV-1 Vif SOCS-box-ElonginBC interaction.,"The HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) neutralizes cell-encoded antiviral APOBEC3 proteins by recruiting a cellular ElonginB (EloB)/ElonginC (EloC)/Cullin5-containing ubiquitin ligase complex, resulting in APOBEC3 ubiquitination and proteolysis. The suppressors-of-cytokine-signalling-like domain (SOCS-box) of HIV-1 Vif is essential for E3 ligase engagement, and contains a BC box as well as an unusual proline-rich motif. Here, we report the NMR solution structure of the Vif SOCS-ElonginBC (EloBC) complex. In contrast to SOCS-boxes described in other proteins, the HIV-1 Vif SOCS-box contains only one α-helical domain followed by a β-sheet fold. The SOCS-box of Vif binds primarily to EloC by hydrophobic interactions. The functionally essential proline-rich motif mediates a direct but weak interaction with residues 101-104 of EloB, inducing a conformational change from an unstructured state to a structured state. The structure of the complex and biophysical studies provide detailed insight into the function of Vif's proline-rich motif and reveal novel dynamic information on the Vif-EloBC interaction."
20728451,Molecular insight into the conformational dynamics of the Elongin BC complex and its interaction with HIV-1 Vif.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virion infectivity factor (Vif) inhibits the innate viral immunity afforded by the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases. Vif targets the APOBEC3 family for poly-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation by linking the Elongin-BC-dependent ubiquitin ligase complex with the APOBEC3 proteins. The interaction between Vif and the heterodimeric Elongin BC complex, which is mediated by Vif's viral suppressor of cytokine signaling box, is essential for Vif function. The biophysical consequences of the full-length Vif:Elongin BC interaction have not been extensively reported. In this study, hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry was used to dissect the Vif:Elongin BC interaction. Elongin C was found to be highly dynamic in the Elongin BC complex while Elongin B was much more stable. Recombinant full-length Vif interacted with the Elongin BC complex in vitro with a K(d) of 1.9 μM and resulted in observable changes in deuterium uptake in both Elongin C and B. Upon binding to Elongin BC, no significant global conformational changes were detected in Vif by hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry, but a short fragment of Vif that consisted of the viral suppressor of cytokine signaling box showed decreased deuterium incorporation upon Elongin BC incubation, suggesting that this region folds upon binding."
20532212,The SOCS-box of HIV-1 Vif interacts with ElonginBC by induced-folding to recruit its Cul5-containing ubiquitin ligase complex.,"The HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, comprising the cellular proteins elongin B and C (EloBC), cullin 5 (Cul5) and RING-box 2 (Rbx2), to the anti-viral proteins APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) and induces their polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In this study, we used purified proteins and direct in vitro binding assays, isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy to describe the molecular mechanism for assembly of the Vif-EloBC ternary complex. We demonstrate that Vif binds to EloBC in two locations, and that both interactions induce structural changes in the SOCS box of Vif as well as EloBC. In particular, in addition to the previously established binding of Vif's BC box to EloC, we report a novel interaction between the conserved Pro-Pro-Leu-Pro motif of Vif and the C-terminal domain of EloB. Using cell-based assays, we further show that this interaction is necessary for the formation of a functional ligase complex, thus establishing a role of this motif. We conclude that HIV-1 Vif engages EloBC via an induced-folding mechanism that does not require additional co-factors, and speculate that these features distinguish Vif from other EloBC specificity factors such as cellular SOCS proteins, and may enhance the prospects of obtaining therapeutic inhibitors of Vif function."
8940009,Identification of the paired basic convertases implicated in HIV gp160 processing based on in vitro assays and expression in CD4(+) cell lines.,"The human immunodeficiency virus HIV envelope glycoprotein gp160 is synthesized as an inactive precursor, which is processed into its fusiogenic form gp120/gp41 by host cell proteinases during its intracellular trafficking. Kexin/subtilisin-related endoproteases have been proposed to be enzyme candidates for this maturation process. In the present study, 1) we examined the ability of partially purified precursor convertases and their isoforms to cleave gp160 in vitro. The data demonstrate that all the convertases tested specifically cleave the HIV envelope glycoprotein into gp120 and gp41. 2) We demonstrated that a 19-amino acid model peptide spanning the gp120/gp41 junction is cleaved by all convertases at the same gp160 site as that recognized in HIV-infected cells. 3) In an effort to evaluate specific convertase inhibitors, we showed that the alpha1-antitrypsin variant, alpha1-PDX, inhibits equally well the ability of the tested convertases to cleave gp160 in vitro. 4) Three lymphocyte cell lines were screened by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in an effort to identify which are the convertases expressed in the most common HIV target, the CD4(+) lymphocytes. The data demonstrate that furin, PC5/6, and the newly cloned PC7 are the main transcribed convertases, suggesting that these proteinases are the major gp160-converting enzymes in T4 lymphocytes."
22479405,Characterization of the interaction of full-length HIV-1 Vif protein with its key regulator CBFβ and CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase components.,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) viral infectivity factor (Vif) is essential for viral replication because of its ability to eliminate the host's antiviral response to HIV-1 that is mediated by the APOBEC3 family of cellular cytidine deaminases. Vif targets these proteins, including APOBEC3G, for polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation via the formation of a Cullin5-ElonginB/C-based E3 ubiquitin ligase. Determining how the cellular components of this E3 ligase complex interact with Vif is critical to the intelligent design of new antiviral drugs. However, structural studies of Vif, both alone and in complex with cellular partners, have been hampered by an inability to express soluble full-length Vif protein. Here we demonstrate that a newly identified host regulator of Vif, core-binding factor-beta (CBFβ), interacts directly with Vif, including various isoforms and a truncated form of this regulator. In addition, carboxyl-terminal truncations of Vif lacking the BC-box and cullin box motifs were sufficient for CBFβ interaction. Furthermore, association of Vif with CBFβ, alone or in combination with Elongin B/C (EloB/C), greatly increased the solubility of full-length Vif. Finally, a stable complex containing Vif-CBFβ-EloB/C was purified in large quantity and shown to bind purified Cullin5 (Cul5). This efficient strategy for purifying Vif-Cul5-CBFβ-EloB/C complexes will facilitate future structural and biochemical studies of Vif function and may provide the basis for useful screening approaches for identifying novel anti-HIV drug candidates."
20828565,"An aminopeptidase from Streptomyces sp. KK565 degrades beta amyloid monomers, oligomers and fibrils.","The accumulation of beta amyloid (Aβ) has been a primary target for Alzheimer disease therapeutic strategies. Previously, we discovered an activity from Streptomyces sp. KK565 growth media that inhibits Aβ aggregation. The active component was an aminopeptidase and named Streptomyces sp. KK565 aminopeptidase (SKAP). SKAP cleaved N-terminal amino-acids of Aβ(1-42) monomer, inhibited formation of fibrils and protected Aβ(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity. Over-expression of a human homolog of SKAP, glutamate carboxypeptidase II (hGCPII) in Aβ-oversynthesizing cells dramatically reduced the Aβ levels. These findings suggest a possible role of M28 family peptidases in preventing Aβ deposits in mammalian brain."
16893449,Effect of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex on HIV-1 Tat activated transcription.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the etiologic agent of acquired immunodeficiency virus (AIDS). Following entry into the host cell, the viral RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA and subsequently integrated into the host genome as a chromatin template. The integrated proviral DNA, along with the specific chromatinized environment in which integration takes place allows for the coordinated regulation of viral transcription and replication. While the specific roles of and interplay between viral and host proteins have not been fully elucidated, numerous reports indicate that HIV-1 retains the ability for self-regulation via the pleiotropic effects of its viral proteins. Though viral transcription is fully dependent upon host cellular factors and the state of host activation, recent findings indicate a complex interplay between viral proteins and host transcription regulatory machineries including histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone acetyltransferases (HATs), cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), and histone methyltransferases (HMTs)."
19339032,"Stable complex formation between HIV Rev and the nucleosome assembly protein, NAP1, affects Rev function.","The Rev protein of HIV-1 is essential for HIV-1 proliferation due to its role in exporting viral RNA from the nucleus. We used a modified version of tandem affinity purification (TAP) tagging to identify proteins interacting with HIV-1 Rev in human cells and discovered a prominent interaction between Rev and nucleosome assembly protein 1 (Nap1). This interaction was also observed by specific retention of Nap1 from human cell lysates on a Rev affinity column. Nap1 was found to bind Rev through the Rev arginine-rich domain and altered the oligomerization state of Rev in vitro. Overexpression of Nap1 stimulated the ability of Rev to export RNA, reduced the nucleolar localization of Rev, and affected Rev nuclear import rates. The results suggest that Nap-1 may influence Rev function by increasing the availability of Rev."
23135716,The replication defect of ICP0-null mutant herpes simplex virus 1 can be largely complemented by the combined activities of human cytomegalovirus proteins IE1 and pp71.,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) immediate-early protein ICP0 is required for efficient lytic infection and productive reactivation from latency and induces derepression of quiescent viral genomes. Despite being unrelated at the sequence level, ICP0 and human cytomegalovirus proteins IE1 and pp71 share some functional similarities in their abilities to counteract antiviral restriction mediated by components of cellular nuclear structures known as ND10. To investigate the extent to which IE1 and pp71 might substitute for ICP0, cell lines were developed that express either IE1 or pp71, or both together, in an inducible manner. We found that pp71 dissociated the hDaxx-ATRX complex and inhibited accumulation of these proteins at sites juxtaposed to HSV-1 genomes but had no effect on the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) or Sp100. IE1 caused loss of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-conjugated forms of PML and Sp100 and inhibited the recruitment of these proteins to HSV-1 genome foci but had little effect on hDaxx or ATRX in these assays. Both IE1 and pp71 stimulated ICP0-null mutant plaque formation, but neither to the extent achieved by ICP0. The combination of IE1 and pp71, however, inhibited recruitment of all ND10 proteins to viral genome foci, stimulated ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 plaque formation to near wild-type levels, and efficiently induced derepression of quiescent HSV-1 genomes. These results suggest that ND10-related intrinsic resistance results from the additive effects of several ND10 components and that the effects of IE1 and pp71 on subsets of these components combine to mirror the overall activities of ICP0."
12097584,Daxx-mediated accumulation of human cytomegalovirus tegument protein pp71 at ND10 facilitates initiation of viral infection at these nuclear domains.,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) starts immediate-early transcription at nuclear domains 10 (ND10), forming a highly dynamic immediate transcript environment at this nuclear site. The reason for this spatial correlation remains enigmatic, and the mechanism for induction of transcription at ND10 is unknown. We investigated whether tegument-based transactivators are involved in the specific intranuclear location of HCMV. Here, we demonstrate that the HCMV transactivator tegument protein pp71 accumulates at ND10 before the production of immediate-early proteins. Intracellular trafficking of pp71 is facilitated through binding to a coiled-coil region of Daxx. The C-terminal domain of Daxx then interacts with SUMO-modified PML, resulting in the deposition of pp71 at ND10. In Daxx-deficient cells, pp71 does not accumulate at ND10, proving in vivo the necessity of Daxx for pp71 deposition. Also, HCMV forms immediate transcript environments at sites other than ND10 in Daxx-deficient cells, and so does the HCMV pp71 knockout mutant UL82(-/-) in normal cells. This result strongly suggests that pp71 and Daxx are essential for HCMV transcription at ND10. Lack of Daxx had the effect of reducing the infection rate. We conclude that the tegument transactivator pp71 facilitates viral genome deposition and transcription at ND10, possibly priming HCMV for more efficient productive infection."
15919932,Interaction between the human cytomegalovirus UL82 gene product (pp71) and hDaxx regulates immediate-early gene expression and viral replication.,"The human cytomegalovirus UL82-encoded pp71 protein is required for efficient virus replication and immediate-early gene expression when cells are infected at a low multiplicity. Functions attributed to pp71 include the ability to enhance the infectivity of viral DNA, bind to and target hypophosphorylated Rb family member proteins for degradation, drive quiescent cells into the cell cycle, and bind to the cellular protein hDaxx. Using UL82 mutant viruses, we demonstrate that the LXCXD motif within pp71 is not necessary for efficient virus replication in fibroblasts, suggesting that pp71's ability to degrade hypophosphorylated Rb family members and induce quiescent cells into the cell cycle is not responsible for the growth defect associated with a UL82 deletion mutant. However, UL82 mutants that cannot bind to hDaxx are unable to induce immediate-early gene expression and are severely attenuated for viral replication. These results indicate that the interaction between the human cytomegalovirus UL82 gene product (pp71) and hDaxx regulates immediate-early gene expression and viral replication."
11563677,Characterization of interaction between C-domain on HIV-1 gp41 and the putative receptor protein p62.,"Based on the fact that the binding of HIV-1 gp41 to the putative cellular receptor protein p62 could be inhibited by the C-domain peptide of gp41, we wanted to confirm the interaction of the C-domain with p62 and to characterize the receptor-binding site on the C-domain. We attempted to isolate the putative receptor protein p62 from cell lysates of the human B cell line Raji by affinity chromatography using sepharose-columns which were conjugated with three different peptides of the C-domain respectively. A protein of 62 kDa was isolated by peptide (NP2)-sepharose-column, while none of the proteins was identified in eluates of the other two overlapped peptides of C-domain, indicating that HIV-1 gp41 by the region aa635-664 of C-domain binds to the putative receptor protein p62. Besides, CD spectroscopy analysis revealed that only a NP2 peptide could induce significant conformational change of P62. In addition, the interaction between P62 and three peptides of the C-domain was characterized by the surface plasma resonance (SPR) measurement. It was indicated that only the NP2 peptide significantly inhibited the interaction between rsgp41 and the putative receptor P62, confirming that the protein p62 may serve as a potential receptor for gp41 binding, and the peptide NP2 contains an integrate binding site for gp41 binding to p62."
12407101,HIV-1 integrase forms stable tetramers and associates with LEDGF/p75 protein in human cells.,"We studied human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) complexes derived from nuclei of human cells stably expressing the viral protein from a synthetic gene. We show that in the nuclear extracts IN exists as part of a large distinct complex with an apparent Stokes radius of 61 A, which dissociates upon dilution yielding a core molecule of 41 A. We isolated the IN complexes from cells expressing FLAG-tagged IN and demonstrated that the 41 A core is a tetramer of IN, whereas 61 A molecules are composed of IN tetramers associated with a cellular protein with an apparent molecular mass of 76 kDa. This novel integrase interacting protein was found to be identical to lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75), a protein implicated in regulation of gene expression and cellular stress response. HIV-1 IN and LEDGF co-localized in the nuclei of human cells stably expressing IN. Furthermore, recombinant LEDGF robustly enhanced strand transfer activity of HIV-1 IN in vitro. Our findings indicate that the minimal IN molecule in human cells is a homotetramer, suggesting that at least an octamer of IN is required to accomplish coordinated integration of both retroviral long terminal repeats and that LEDGF is a cellular factor involved in this process."
18353951,Herpes simplex virus type 2 UL56 interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 and increases its ubiquitination.,"The herpes simplex virus UL56 gene is conserved among most members of the Alphaherpesvirinae family and plays a critical role in viral pathogenicity in vivo. The HSV-2 UL56 protein (UL56) is a C-terminally anchored type II membrane protein that is predicted to be inserted into the virion envelope, leaving its N-terminal domain in the tegument. UL56 interacts with KIF1A and UL11. Here we report that UL56 also interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 and increases its ubiquitination. Nedd4 was identified as a UL56-interacting protein by a yeast two-hybrid screen. UL56 bound to Nedd4 via its PY motifs. Nedd4 was phosphorylated and degraded in wild-type HSV-2-infected cells but not in cells infected with a UL56-deficient mutant. Ubiquitination assays revealed that UL56 increased ubiquitinated Nedd4, which was actively degraded in infected cells. UL56 also caused a decrease in Nedd4 protein levels and the increased ubiquitination in cotransfected cells. However, UL56 itself was not ubiquitinated, despite its interaction with Nedd4. Based on these findings, we propose that UL56 regulates Nedd4 in HSV-2-infected cells, although deletion of UL56 had no apparent effect on viral growth in vitro."
11901159,Human Herpesvirus 6 immediate-early 1 protein is a sumoylated nuclear phosphoprotein colocalizing with promyelocytic leukemia protein-associated nuclear bodies.,"Immediate-early (IE) proteins are the first proteins expressed following viral entry and play a crucial role in the initiation of infection. We report the cloning and characterization of a full-length IE1 transcript and protein (IE1B) from human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) variant B. The IE1B transcript consists of five exons (3720 nucleotides), three of which are coding for the IE1 protein. The 1078-amino acid-long IE1B protein is 62% identical and 75% similar to the 941-amino acid IE1 from HHV-6 variant A. IE1B protein can be detected at 4 h post-infection (P.I.), and it is distributed as small intranuclear structures. The maximal number of IE1 bodies ( approximately 10-12/nucleus) is detected at 12 h P.I. after which the IE1 bodies condense into 1-3 larger entities by 24-48 h P.I. During infection the IE1B protein is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. IE1B undergoes further post-translational modification with its conjugation to the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO-1) peptide. IE1B colocalizes with SUMO-1 and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies during infection as well as in transfection experiments. Finally, IE1 from variant B is a weaker transactivator than IE1 from variant A, when assayed using heterologous promoters. Overall, the characterization of the HHV-6 IE1B protein presented highlights the similarity and divergence between IE1 from both variants and provides useful information pertaining to the early phase of infection."
22792066,Proteasome-dependent disruption of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex by HCMV protein pUL21a.,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase which controls ubiquitination and degradation of multiple cell cycle regulatory proteins. During infection, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread pathogen, not only phosphorylates the APC coactivator Cdh1 via the multifunctional viral kinase pUL97, it also promotes degradation of APC subunits via an unknown mechanism. Using a proteomics approach, we found that a recently identified HCMV protein, pUL21a, interacted with the APC. Importantly, we determined that expression of pUL21a was necessary and sufficient for proteasome-dependent degradation of APC subunits APC4 and APC5. This resulted in APC disruption and required pUL21a binding to the APC. We have identified the proline-arginine amino acid pair at residues 109-110 in pUL21a to be critical for its ability to bind and regulate the APC. A point mutant virus in which proline-arginine were mutated to alanines (PR-AA) grew at wild-type levels. However, a double mutant virus in which the viral ability to regulate the APC was abrogated by both PR-AA point mutation and UL97 deletion was markedly more attenuated compared to the UL97 deletion virus alone. This suggests that these mutations are synthetically lethal, and that HCMV exploits two viral factors to ensure successful disruption of the APC to overcome its restriction on virus infection. This study reveals the HCMV protein pUL21a as a novel APC regulator and uncovers a unique viral mechanism to subvert APC activity."
19121997,TRAM1 participates in human cytomegalovirus US2- and US11-mediated dislocation of an endoplasmic reticulum membrane glycoprotein.,"The human cytomegalovirus proteins US2 and US11 have co-opted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control to facilitate the destruction of major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains. The class I heavy chains are dislocated from the ER to the cytosol, where they are deglycosylated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome. We examined the role of TRAM1 (translocating chain-associated membrane protein-1) in the dislocation of class I molecules using US2- and US11-expressing cells. TRAM1 is an ER protein initially characterized for its role in processing nascent polypeptides. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that TRAM1 can complex with the wild type US2 and US11 proteins as well as deglycosylated and polyubiquitinated class I degradation intermediates. In studies using US2- and US11-TRAM1 knockdown cells, we observed an increase in levels of class I heavy chains. Strikingly, increased levels of glycosylated heavy chains were observed in TRAM1 knockdown cells when compared with control cells in a pulse-chase experiment. In fact, US11-mediated class I dislocation was more sensitive to the lack of TRAM1 than US2. These results provide further evidence that these viral proteins may utilize distinct complexes to facilitate class I dislocation. For example, US11-mediated class I heavy chain degradation requires Derlin-1 and SEL1L, whereas signal peptide peptidase is critical for US2-induced class I destabilization. In addition, TRAM1 can complex with the dislocation factors Derlin-1 and signal peptide peptidase. Collectively, the data support a model in which TRAM1 functions as a cofactor to promote efficient US2- and US11-dependent dislocation of major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains."
10629049,Mutations in host cell factor 1 separate its role in cell proliferation from recruitment of VP16 and LZIP.,"Host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) is a nuclear protein required for progression through G(1) phase of the cell cycle and, via its association with VP16, transcriptional activation of the herpes simplex virus immediate-early genes. Both functions require a six-bladed beta-propeller domain encoded by residues 1 to 380 of HCF-1 as well as an additional amino-terminal region. The beta-propeller domain is well conserved in HCF homologues, consistent with a critical cellular function. To date, the only known cellular target of the beta-propeller is a bZIP transcription factor known as LZIP or Luman. Whether the interaction between HCF-1 and LZIP is required for cell proliferation remains to be determined. In this study, we used directed mutations to show that all six blades of the HCF-1 beta-propeller contribute to VP16-induced complex assembly, association with LZIP, and cell cycle progression. Although LZIP and VP16 share a common tetrapeptide HCF-binding motif, our results reveal profound differences in their interaction with HCF-1. Importantly, with several of the mutants we observe a poor correlation between the ability to associate with LZIP and promote cell proliferation in the context of the full HCF-1 amino terminus, arguing that the HCF-1 beta-propeller domain must target other cellular transcription factors in order to contribute to G(1) progression."
19176615,Identification of TRIM23 as a cofactor involved in the regulation of NF-kappaB by human cytomegalovirus.,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) regulates NF-kappaB during infection by a variety of mechanisms. For example, the HCMV gene product, UL144, is known to activate NF-kappaB in a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-dependent manner, causing the upregulation of the chemokine CCL22 (MDC). Viral UL144 is expressed from the UL/b' region of the HCMV genome at early times postinfection and is a TNFR1-like homologue. Despite this homology to the TNFR1 receptor superfamily, UL144 does not bind to members of the TNF ligand superfamily. We show here that the upregulation of NF-kappaB by UL144 is dependent upon cellular tripartite motif 23 (TRIM23) protein. We propose a mechanism by which UL144 activates NF-kappaB through a direct interaction with the cellular protein TRIM23 in a complex containing TRAF6. In contrast, TRIM23 is not involved in conventional double-stranded RNA signaling via NF-kappaB. Therefore, we present a novel role for TRIM23 that is specific to UL144-mediated activation of NF-kappaB during the course of virus infection."
20444888,Human cytomegalovirus IE72 protein interacts with the transcriptional repressor hDaxx to regulate LUNA gene expression during lytic infection.,"A putative latency-associated transcript (LUNA) complementary to the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL81-82 region previously identified in seropositive donors' monocytes is also expressed during lytic infection. Thus, the LUNA promoter is active during both lytic and latent infection. Consequently, the mechanisms regulating this promoter may provide further insight into factors that determine whether the outcome of HCMV infection is latent or lytic. By transfection, the LUNA promoter exhibited low but reproducible activity. Substantial activation by virus infection suggested that a viral factor was important for LUNA expression during lytic infection. IE72, a known transactivator of viral promoters, activated the LUNA promoter in cotransfection assays. Furthermore, coinfection with wild-type HCMV but not an IE72 deletion virus (CR208) also activated the LUNA promoter. Finally, diminished LUNA gene expression in CR208 virus-infected cells supported a role for IE72 in LUNA gene expression. The initial regulation of herpesvirus immediate-early gene expression is associated with proteins found at cellular nuclear domain 10 (ND10) bodies, such as PML, hDaxx, and ATRX. hDaxx transfection repressed LUNA promoter activity. Furthermore, we observed binding of hDaxx to the LUNA promoter, which was abrogated by IE72 gene expression via direct interaction. Finally, we show that small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of the hDaxx interaction partner ATRX rescued LUNA gene expression in CR208-infected cells. Overall, these data show that hDaxx/ATRX-mediated repression of LUNA during lytic infection absolutely requires IE72 gene expression. It also suggests that the targeting of cellular factors by IE72 is important throughout the different phases of HCMV gene expression during productive infection."
22300411,Suppressive regulation of KSHV RTA with O-GlcNAcylation.,"The replication and transcription activator (RTA) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a molecular switch that initiates a productive replication of latent KSHV genomes. KSHV RTA (K-RTA) is composed of 691 amino acids with high Ser and Thr content (17.7%), but to what extent these Ser and Thr are modified in vivo has not been explored."
19939918,Cellular corepressor TLE2 inhibits replication-and-transcription- activator-mediated transactivation and lytic reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.,"Replication and transcription activator (RTA) encoded by open reading frame 50 (ORF50) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is essential and sufficient to initiate lytic reactivation. RTA activates its target genes through direct binding with high affinity to its responsive elements or by interaction with cellular factors, such as RBP-Jkappa, Ap-1, C/EBP-alpha, and Oct-1. In this study, we identified transducin-like enhancer of split 2 (TLE2) as a novel RTA binding protein by using yeast two-hybrid screening of a human spleen cDNA library. The interaction between TLE2 and RTA was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase (GST) binding and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that TLE2 and RTA were colocalized in the same nuclear compartment in KSHV-infected cells. This interaction recruited TLE2 to RTA bound to its recognition sites on DNA and repressed RTA auto-activation and transactivation activity. Moreover, TLE2 also inhibited the induction of lytic replication and virion production driven by RTA. We further showed that the Q (Gln-rich), SP (Ser-Pro-rich), and WDR (Trp-Asp repeat) domains of TLE2 and the Pro-rich domain of RTA were essential for this interaction. RBP-Jkappa has been shown previously to bind to the same Pro-rich domain of RTA, and this binding can be subject to competition by TLE2. In addition, TLE2 can form a complex with RTA to access the cognate DNA sequence of the RTA-responsive element at different promoters. Intriguingly, the transcription level of TLE2 could be upregulated by RTA during the lytic reactivation process. In conclusion, we identified a new RTA binding protein, TLE2, and demonstrated that TLE2 inhibited replication and transactivation mediated by RTA. This provides another potentially important mechanism for maintenance of KSHV viral latency through interaction with a host protein."
22072767,Proteomic profiling of the human cytomegalovirus UL35 gene products reveals a role for UL35 in the DNA repair response.,"Human cytomegalovirus infections involve the extensive modification of host cell pathways, including cell cycle control, the regulation of the DNA damage response, and averting promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-mediated antiviral responses. The UL35 gene from human cytomegalovirus is important for viral gene expression and efficient replication and encodes two proteins, UL35 and UL35a, whose mechanism of action is not well understood. Here, affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry was used to identify previously unknown human cellular targets of UL35 and UL35a. We demonstrate that both viral proteins interact with the ubiquitin-specific protease USP7, and that UL35 expression can alter USP7 subcellular localization. In addition, UL35 (but not UL35a) was found to associate with three components of the Cul4(DCAF1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (DCAF1, DDB1, and DDA1) previously shown to be targeted by the HIV-1 Vpr protein. The coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy of DCAF1 mutants revealed that the C-terminal region of DCAF1 is required for association with UL35 and mediates the dramatic relocalization of DCAF1 to UL35 nuclear bodies, which also contain conjugated ubiquitin. As previously reported for the Vpr-DCAF1 interaction, UL35 (but not UL35a) expression resulted in the accumulation of cells in the G(2) phase of the cell cycle, which is typical of a DNA damage response, and activated the G(2) checkpoint in a DCAF1-dependent manner. In addition, UL35 (but not UL35a) induced γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci, indicating the activation of DNA damage and repair responses. Therefore, the identified interactions suggest that UL35 can contribute to viral replication through the manipulation of host responses."
17055437,Redox regulation facilitates optimal peptide selection by MHC class I during antigen processing.,"Activated CD8(+) T cells discriminate infected and tumor cells from normal self by recognizing MHC class I-bound peptides on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The mechanism by which MHC class I molecules select optimal peptides against a background of prevailing suboptimal peptides and in a considerably proteolytic ER environment remained unknown. Here, we identify protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an enzyme critical to the formation of correct disulfide bonds in proteins, as a component of the peptide-loading complex. We show that PDI stabilizes a peptide-receptive site by regulating the oxidation state of the disulfide bond in the MHC peptide-binding groove, a function that is essential for selecting optimal peptides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human cytomegalovirus US3 protein inhibits CD8(+) T cell recognition by mediating PDI degradation, verifying the functional relevance of PDI-catalyzed peptide editing in controlling intracellular pathogens. These results establish a link between thiol-based redox regulation and antigen processing."
11314014,HHV-8 encoded vIRF-1 represses the interferon antiviral response by blocking IRF-3 recruitment of the CBP/p300 coactivators.,"Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) has developed unique mechanisms for altering cellular proliferative and apoptotic control pathways by incorporating viral homologs to several cellular regulatory genes into its genome. One of the important pirated genes encoded by the ORF K9 reading frame is a viral homolog of the interferon regulatory factors (IRF), a family of cellular transcription proteins that regulates expression of genes involved in pathogen response, immune modulation and cell proliferation. vIRF-1 has been shown to downregulate the interferon- and IRF-mediated transcriptional activation of ISG and murine IFNA4 gene promoters. In this study we demonstrate that vIRF-1 efficiently inhibited virus-induced expression of endogenous interferon B, CC chemokine RANTES and CXC chemokine IP-10 genes. Co-expression analysis revealed that vIRF-1 selectively blocked IRF-3 but not IRF-7-mediated transactivation. vIRF-1 was able to bind to both IRF-3 and IRF-7 in vivo as detected by coimmunoprecipitation analysis, but did not affect IRF-3 dimerization, nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity. Rather, vIRF-1 interacted with the CBP/p300 coactivators and efficiently inhibited the formation of transcriptionally competent IRF-3-CBP/p300 complexes. These results illustrate that vIRF-1 is able to block the early stages of the IFN response to virus infection by interfering with the activation of IRF-3 responsive, immediate early IFN genes."
23365429,Epstein-Barr virus deubiquitinase downregulates TRAF6-mediated NF-κB signaling during productive replication.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human oncogenic herpesvirus that establishes a lifelong latent infection in the host, occasionally enters lytic infection to produce progeny viruses. The EBV oncogene latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), which is expressed in both latent and lytic infection, constitutively activates the canonical NF-κB (p65) pathway. Such LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation is necessary for proliferation of latently infected cells and inhibition of viral lytic cycle progression. Actually, canonical NF-κB target gene expression was suppressed upon the onset of lytic infection. TRAF6, which is activated by conjugation of polyubiquitin chains, associates with LMP1 to mediate NF-κB signal transduction. We have found that EBV-encoded BPLF1 interacts with and deubiquitinates TRAF6 to inhibit NF-κB signaling during lytic infection. HEK293 cells with BPLF1-deficient recombinant EBV exhibited poor viral DNA replication compared with the wild type. Furthermore, exogenous expression of BPLF1 or p65 knockdown in cells restored DNA replication of BPLF1-deficient viruses, indicating that EBV BPLF1 deubiquitinates TRAF6 to inhibit NF-κB signal transduction, leading to promotion of viral lytic DNA replication."
19109396,Regulation of APOBEC3 proteins by a novel YXXL motif in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vif and simian immunodeficiency virus SIVagm Vif.,"The APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases are potent antiviral factors that restrict the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells, the viral accessory protein Vif binds to APOBEC3G (A3G), APOBEC3F (A3F), and APOBEC3C (A3C) and targets these proteins for polyubiquitination by forming an E3 ubiquitin ligase with cullin 5. Previous studies identified regions of HIV-1 Vif, 40YRHHY44 and 12QVDRMR17, which are important for interaction with A3G and A3F, respectively, and showed that Vif residues 54 to 71 are sufficient for A3G binding. Here, we identify 69YXXL72 as a novel conserved motif in HIV-1 Vif that mediates binding to human A3G and its subsequent degradation. Studies on other APOBEC3 proteins revealed that Tyr69 and Leu72 are important for the degradation of A3F and A3C as well. Similar to A3F, A3C regulation is also mediated by Vif residues 12QVDRMR17. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Vif was shown to bind and degrade African green monkey A3G (agmA3G) and, unexpectedly, human A3C. The YXXL motif of SIVagm Vif was important for the inactivation of agmA3G and human A3C. Unlike HIV-1 Vif, however, SIVagm Vif does not require Tyr40 and His43 for agmA3G degradation. Tyr69 in the YXXL motif was critical for binding of recombinant glutathione S-transferase-Vif(1-94) to A3G in vitro. These results suggest that the YXXL motif in Vif is a potential target for small-molecule inhibitors to block Vif interaction with A3G, A3F, and A3C, and thereby protect cells against HIV-1 infection."
20592083,Identification of a critical T(Q/D/E)x5ADx2(I/L) motif from primate lentivirus Vif proteins that regulate APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F neutralizing activity.,"Primate lentiviruses are unique in that they produce several accessory proteins to help in the establishment of productive viral infection. The major function of these proteins is to clear host resistance factors that inhibit viral replication. Vif is one of these proteins. It functions as an adaptor that binds to the cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) and bridges them to a cullin 5 (Cul5) and elongin (Elo) B/C E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for proteasomal degradation. So far, 11 discontinuous domains in Vif have been identified that regulate this degradation process. Here we report another domain, T(Q/D/E)x(5)ADx(2)(I/L), which is located at residues 96 to 107 in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif protein. This domain is conserved not only in all HIV-1 subtypes but also in other primate lentiviruses, including HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which infects rhesus macaques (SIVmac) and African green monkeys (SIVagm). Mutations of the critical residues in this motif seriously disrupted Vif's neutralizing activity toward both A3G and A3F. This motif regulates Vif interaction not only with A3G and A3F but also with Cul5. When this motif was inactivated in the HIV-1 genome, Vif failed to exclude A3G and A3F from virions, resulting in abortive HIV replication in nonpermissive human T cells. Thus, T(Q/D/E)x(5)ADx(2)(I/L) is a critical functional motif that directly supports the adaptor function of Vif and is an attractive target for inhibition of Vif function."
18619467,Characterization of conserved motifs in HIV-1 Vif required for APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F interaction.,"Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G, or A3G) and related cytidine deaminases such as apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3F (APOBEC3F, or A3F) are potent inhibitors of retroviruses. Formation of infectious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 requires suppression of multiple cytidine deaminases by Vif. HIV-1 Vif suppresses various APOBEC3 proteins through a common mechanism by recruiting Cullin5, ElonginB, and ElonginC E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce target protein polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Domains in Vif that mediate APOBEC3 recognition have not been fully characterized. In the present study, we identified a VxIPLx(4-5)LxPhix(2)YWxL motif in HIV-1 Vif, which is required for efficient interaction between Vif and A3G, Vif-mediated A3G degradation and virion exclusion, and functional suppression of the A3G antiviral activity. Amino acids 52 to 72 of HIV-1 Vif (including the VxIPLx(4-5)LxPhix(2)YWxL motif) alone could mediate interaction with A3G, and this interaction was abolished by mutations of two hydrophobic amino acids in this region. We have also observed that a Vif mutant was ineffective against A3G, yet it retained the ability to interact with Cullin5-E3 ubiquitin complex and A3G, suggesting that interaction with A3G is necessary but not sufficient to inhibit its antiviral function. Unlike the previously identified motif of HIV-1 Vif amino acids 40 to 44, which is only important for A3G suppression, the VxIPLx(4-5)LxPhix(2)YWxL motif is also required for efficient A3F interaction and suppression. On the other hand, another motif, TGERxW, of HIV-1 Vif amino acids 74 to 79 was found to be mainly important for A3F interaction and inhibition. Both the VxIPLx(4-5)LxPhix(2)YWxL and TGERxW motifs are highly conserved among HIV-1, HIV-2, and various simian immunodeficiency virus Vif proteins. Our data suggest that primate lentiviral Vif molecules recognize their autologous APOBEC3 proteins through conserved structural features that represent attractive targets for the development of novel inhibitors."
19088851,Distinct determinants in HIV-1 Vif and human APOBEC3 proteins are required for the suppression of diverse host anti-viral proteins.,"APOBEC3G (A3G) and related cytidine deaminases of the APOBEC3 family of proteins are potent inhibitors of many retroviruses, including HIV-1. Formation of infectious HIV-1 requires the suppression of multiple cytidine deaminases by Vif. HIV-1 Vif suppresses various APOBEC3 proteins through the common mechanism of recruiting the Cullin5-ElonginB-ElonginC E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce target protein polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. The domains in Vif and various APOBEC3 proteins required for APOBEC3 recognition and degradation have not been fully characterized."
20335268,Identification of 81LGxGxxIxW89 and 171EDRW174 domains from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vif that regulate APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F neutralizing activity.,"The human cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) potently restrict human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication, but they are neutralized by the viral protein Vif. Vif bridges A3G and A3F with a Cullin 5 (Cul5)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase and mediates their proteasomal degradation. This mechanism has been extensively studied, and several Vif domains have been identified that are critical for A3G and A3F neutralization. Here, we identified two additional domains. Via sequence analysis of more than 2,000 different HIV-1 Vif proteins, we identified two highly conserved amino acid sequences, (81)LGxGxSIEW(89) and (171)EDRWN(175). Within the (81)LGxGxSIEW(89) sequence, residues L81, G82, G84, and, to a lesser extent, I87 and W89 play very critical roles in A3G/A3F neutralization. In particular, residues L81 and G82 determine Vif binding to A3F, residue G84 determines Vif binding to both A3G and A3F, and residues (86)SIEW(89) affect Vif binding to A3F, A3G, and Cul5. Accordingly, this (81)LGxGxSIEW(89) sequence was designated the (81)LGxGxxIxW(89) domain. Within the (171)EDRWN(175) sequence, all residues except N175 are almost equally important for regulation of A3F neutralization, and consistently, they determine Vif binding only to A3F. Accordingly, this domain was designated (171)EDRW(174). The LGxGxxIxW domain is also partially conserved in simian immunodeficiency virus Vif from rhesus macaques (SIVmac239) and has a similar activity. Thus, (81)LGxGxxIxW(89) and (171)EDRW(174) are two novel functional domains that are very critical for Vif function. They could become new targets for inhibition of Vif activity during HIV replication."
17609272,Ubiquitination of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag is highly dependent on Gag membrane association.,"Ubiquitin is important for the release of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and several other retroviruses. All major domains of the HIV-1 Gag protein are monoubiquitinated, but the modifying machinery and the function of HIV-1 Gag ubiquitination remain unclear. Here, we show that the induction of a late budding arrest by mutation of the HIV-1 PTAP motif or by specific inhibition of selected ESCRT components leads to an increase of Gag-ubiquitin conjugates in cells, which coincides with an accumulation of detergent-insoluble, multimerized Gag at the plasma membrane. Membrane flotation experiments revealed that ubiquitinated Gag is highly enriched in membrane-bound fractions. Based on these findings, we propose that a blocking of virus release results in increased Gag ubiquitination as a consequence of its prolonged membrane association. Consistent with this, ubiquitination of a membrane-binding-defective (G2A)Gag mutant was dramatically reduced and the ubiquitination levels of truncated Gag proteins correlated with their abilities to bind to membranes. We therefore propose that membrane association and multimerization of HIV-1 Gag proteins, rather than a specific motif within Gag, trigger recognition by the cellular ubiquitination machinery."
22379088,Small-molecule inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication by targeting the interaction between Vif and ElonginC.,"The HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein is essential for viral replication. Vif recruits cellular ElonginB/C-Cullin5 E3 ubiquitin ligase to target the host antiviral protein APOBEC3G (A3G) for proteasomal degradation. In the absence of Vif, A3G is packaged into budding HIV-1 virions and introduces multiple mutations in the newly synthesized minus-strand viral DNA to restrict virus replication. Thus, the A3G-Vif-E3 complex represents an attractive target for development of novel anti-HIV drugs. In this study, we identified a potent small molecular compound (VEC-5) by virtual screening and validated its anti-Vif activity through biochemical analysis. We show that VEC-5 inhibits virus replication only in A3G-positive cells. Treatment with VEC-5 increased cellular A3G levels when Vif was coexpressed and enhanced A3G incorporation into HIV-1 virions to reduce viral infectivity. Coimmunoprecipitation and computational analysis further attributed the anti-Vif activity of VEC-5 to the inhibition of Vif from direct binding to the ElonginC protein. These findings support the notion that suppressing Vif function can liberate A3G to carry out its antiviral activity and demonstrate that regulation of the Vif-ElonginC interaction is a novel target for small-molecule inhibitors of HIV-1."
18499212,The HIV-1 Vif PPLP motif is necessary for human APOBEC3G binding and degradation.,"The HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif) is required during viral replication to inactivate the host cell anti-viral factor, APOBEC3G (A3G). Vif binds A3G and a Cullin5-ElonginBC E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which results in the proteasomal degradation of A3G. The Vif PPLP motif (amino acids 161-164) is essential for normal Vif function because mutations in this motif reduce the infectivity of virions produced in T-cells. In this report, we demonstrate that mutation of the Vif PPLP motif reduces Vif binding to A3G without affecting its interaction with ElonginC and Cullin5. We demonstrate that the failure of the Vif mutant to bind A3G resulted in A3G incorporation into assembling virions with loss of viral infectivity."
14614829,The Vif protein of HIV triggers degradation of the human antiretroviral DNA deaminase APOBEC3G.,"APOBEC3G is a human cellular enzyme that is incorporated into retroviral particles and acts to restrict retroviral replication in infected cells by deaminating dC to dU in the first (minus)-strand cDNA replication intermediate. HIV, however, encodes a protein (virion infectivity factor, Vif ), which overcomes APOBEC3G-mediated restriction but by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that Vif triggers APOBEC3G degradation by a proteasome-dependent pathway and that an 80 amino acid region of APOBEC3G surrounding its first zinc coordination motif is sufficient to confer the ability to partake in an interaction involving Vif. Inhibitors of this interaction might therefore prove therapeutically useful in blocking Vif-mediated APOBEC3G destruction."
22369580,Hydrodynamic and functional analysis of HIV-1 Vif oligomerization.,"HIV-1 Vif is an accessory protein that induces the proteasomal degradation of the host restriction factor, apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G). The N-terminal half of Vif binds to APOBEC3G, and the C-terminal half binds to subunits of a cullin 5-based ubiquitin ligase. This Vif-directed ubiquitin ligase induces the degradation of APOBEC3G (a cytidine deaminase) and thereby protects the viral genome from mutation. A conserved PPLP motif near the C-terminus of Vif is essential for Vif function and is also involved in Vif oligomerization. However, the mechanism and functional significance of Vif oligomerization is unclear. We employed analytical ultracentrifugation to examine the oligomeric properties of Vif in solution. Contrary to previous reports, we find that Vif oligomerization does not require the conserved PPLP motif. Instead, our data suggest a more complex mechanism involving interactions among the HCCH motif, the BC box, and downstream residues in Vif. Mutation of residues near the PPLP motif (S165 and V166) affected the oligomeric properties of Vif and weakened the ability of Vif to bind and induce the degradation of APOBEC3G. We propose that Vif oligomerization may represent a mechanism for regulating interactions with APOBEC3G."
19535450,A patch of positively charged amino acids surrounding the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vif SLVx4Yx9Y motif influences its interaction with APOBEC3G.,"The amino-terminal region of the Vif molecule in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) contains a conserved SLV/Ix4Yx9Y motif that was first described in 1992, but the importance of this motif for Vif function has not yet been examined. Our characterization of the amino acids surrounding this motif in HIV-1 Vif indicated that the region is critical for APOBEC3 suppression. In particular, amino acids K22, K26, Y30, and Y40 were found to be important for the Vif-induced degradation and suppression of cellular APOBEC3G (A3G). However, mutation of these residues had little effect on the Vif-mediated suppression of A3F, A3C, or A3DE, suggesting that these four residues are not important for Vif assembly with the Cul5 E3 ubiquitin ligase or protein folding in general. The LV portion of the Vif SLV/Ix4Yx9Y motif was found to be required for optimal suppression of A3F, A3C, or A3DE. Thus, the SLV/Ix4Yx9Y motif and surrounding amino acids represent an important functional domain in the Vif-mediated defense against APOBEC3. In particular, the positively charged K26 of HIV-1 Vif is invariably conserved within the SLV/Ix4Yx9Y motif of HIV/SIV Vif molecules and was the most critical residue for A3G inactivation. A patch of positively charged and hydrophilic residues (K(22)x(3)K(26)x(3)Y(30)x(9)YRHHY(44)) and a cluster of hydrophobic residues (V(55)xIPLx(4-5)LxPhix2YWxL(72)) were both involved in A3G binding and inactivation. These structural motifs in HIV-1 Vif represent attractive targets for the development of lead inhibitors to combat HIV infection."
18326044,APOBEC3G is degraded by the proteasomal pathway in a Vif-dependent manner without being polyubiquitylated.,"Although the covalent attachment of a polyubiquitin is the prevailing paradigm for entry into proteasomes, accumulating evidence suggests that poorly defined ubiquitin-free pathways also degrade proteins. The cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G) potently inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication by disrupting viral reverse transcription. However, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 produces a viral infectivity factor (Vif) to destroy this antiretroviral protein. It was shown that Vif binds to both A3G and a Cullin 5 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. It is currently accepted that this enzyme polyubiquitylates A3G on lysine residues, resulting in its degradation by proteasomes. Here, we find that A3G without ubiquitylation is still degraded by proteasomes in a Vif-dependent manner. We further show that Vif is polyubiquitylated and that this event could be critical for A3G proteasomal degradation. Thus, A3G is degraded by a novel pathway that might involve ubiquitylation of one protein and then targets a second binding partner for proteasomal entry and degradation. We propose that instead of triggering A3G polyubiquitylation, polyubiquitylated Vif might serve as a vehicle to transport A3G into proteasomes for degradation."
18680593,APOBEC3G-UBA2 fusion as a potential strategy for stable expression of APOBEC3G and inhibition of HIV-1 replication.,"Although APOBEC3G protein is a potent and innate anti-HIV-1 cellular factor, HIV-1 Vif counteracts the effect of APOBEC3G by promoting its degradation through proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Thus, any means that could prevent APOBEC3G degradation could potentially enhance its anti-viral effect. The UBA2 domain has been identified as an intrinsic stabilization signal that protects protein from proteasomal degradation. In this pilot study, we tested whether APOBEC3G, when it is fused with UBA2, can resist Vif-mediated proteasomal degradation and further inhibit HIV-1 infection."
14528301,HIV-1 Vif protein binds the editing enzyme APOBEC3G and induces its degradation.,"The viral infectivity factor (Vif) encoded by HIV-1 neutralizes a potent antiviral pathway that occurs in human T lymphocytes and several leukemic T-cell lines termed nonpermissive, but not in other cells termed permissive. In the absence of Vif, this antiviral pathway efficiently inactivates HIV-1. It was recently reported that APOBEC3G (also known as CEM-15), a cytidine deaminase nucleic acid-editing enzyme, confers this antiviral phenotype on permissive cells. Here we describe evidence that Vif binds APOBEC3G and induces its rapid degradation, thus eliminating it from cells and preventing its incorporation into HIV-1 virions. Studies of Vif mutants imply that it contains two domains, one that binds APOBEC3G and another with a conserved SLQ(Y/F)LA motif that mediates APOBEC3G degradation by a proteasome-dependent pathway. These results provide promising approaches for drug discovery."
15611076,HIV-1 Vif can directly inhibit apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G-mediated cytidine deamination by using a single amino acid interaction and without protein degradation.,"The human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G), also known as CEM-15, is a host-cell factor involved in innate resistance to retroviral infection. HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein was shown to protect the virus from APOBEC3G-mediated viral cDNA hypermutation. The mechanism proposed for protection of the virus by HIV-1 Vif is mediated by APOBEC3G degradation through ubiquitination and the proteasomal pathway. Here we show that in Escherichia coli the APOBEC3G-induced cytidine deamination is inhibited by expression of Vif without depletion of deaminase. Moreover, inhibition of deaminase-mediated bacterial hypermutation is dependent on a single amino acid substitution D128K that renders APOBEC3G resistant to Vif inhibition. This single amino acid was elegantly proven by other authors to determine species-specific sensitivity. Our results show that in bacteria this single amino acid substitution controls Vif-dependent blocking of APOBEC3G that is dependent on a strong protein interaction. The C-terminal region of Vif is responsible for this strong protein-protein interaction. In conclusion, our experiments suggest a complement to the model of Vif-induced degradation of APOBEC3G by bringing to relevance that deaminase inhibition can also result from a direct interaction with Vif protein."
22124328,ACBD3-mediated recruitment of PI4KB to picornavirus RNA replication sites.,"Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KB) is a host factor required for genome RNA replication of enteroviruses, small non-enveloped viruses belonging to the family Picornaviridae. Here, we demonstrated that PI4KB is also essential for genome replication of another picornavirus, Aichi virus (AiV), but is recruited to the genome replication sites by a different strategy from that utilized by enteroviruses. AiV non-structural proteins, 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB, interacted with a Golgi protein, acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3). Furthermore, we identified previously unknown interaction between ACBD3 and PI4KB, which provides a novel manner of Golgi recruitment of PI4KB. Knockdown of ACBD3 or PI4KB suppressed AiV RNA replication. The viral proteins, ACBD3, PI4KB, and phophatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) localized to the viral RNA replication sites. AiV replication and recruitment of PI4KB to the RNA replication sites were not affected by brefeldin A, in contrast to those in enterovirus infection. These results indicate that a viral protein/ACBD3/PI4KB complex is formed to synthesize PI4P at the AiV RNA replication sites and plays an essential role in viral RNA replication."
16129692,Distinct protein phosphatase 2A heterotrimers modulate growth factor signaling to extracellular signal-regulated kinases and Akt.,"A key regulator of many kinase cascades, heterotrimeric protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is composed of catalytic (C), scaffold (A), and variable regulatory subunits (B, B', B'' gene families). In neuronal PC12 cells, PP2A acts predominantly as a gatekeeper of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity, as shown by inducible RNA interference of the Aalpha scaffolding subunit and PP2A inhibition by okadaic acid. Although okadaic acid potentiates Akt/protein kinase B and ERK phosphorylation in response to epidermal, basic fibroblast, or nerve growth factor, silencing of Aalpha paradoxically has the opposite effect. Epidermal growth factor receptor Tyr phosphorylation was unchanged following Aalpha knockdown, suggesting that chronic Akt and ERK hyperphosphorylation leads to compensatory down-regulation of signaling molecules upstream of Ras and blunted growth factor responses. Inducible exchange of wild-type Aalpha with a mutant with selective B' subunit binding deficiency implicated PP2A/B' heterotrimers as Akt modulators. Conversely, silencing of the B-family regulatory subunits Balpha and Bdelta led to hyperactivation of ERK stimulated by constitutively active MEK1. In vitro dephosphorylation assays further support a role for Balpha and Bdelta in targeting the PP2A heterotrimer to dephosphorylate and inactivate ERKs. Thus, receptor tyrosine kinase signaling cascades leading to Akt and ERK activation are modulated by PP2A holoenzymes with distinct regulatory properties."
16126728,Positive regulation of IkappaB kinase signaling by protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A.,"Transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a key regulatory role in the cellular response to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). In the absence of TNF, NF-kappaB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IkappaB proteins. Phosphorylation of IkappaBby the beta-catalytic subunit of IKK, a multicomponent IkappaB kinase, targets the inhibitor for proteolytic destruction and facilitates nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. This pathway is initiated by TNF-dependent phosphorylation of T loop serines in IKKbeta, which greatly stimulates IkappaB kinase activity. Prior in vitro mixing experiments indicate that protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A) can dephosphorylate these T loop serines and inactivate IKK, suggesting a negative regulatory role for PP2A in IKK signaling. Here we provided several in vivo lines of evidence indicating that PP2A plays a positive rather than a negative role in the regulation of IKK. First, TNF-induced degradation of IkappaB is attenuated in cells treated with okadaic acid or fostriecin, two potent inhibitors of PP2A. Second, PP2A forms stable complexes with IKK in untransfected mammalian cells. This interaction is critically dependent on amino acid residues 121-179 of the IKKgamma regulatory subunit. Third, deletion of the PP2A-binding site in IKKgamma attenuates T loop phosphorylation and catalytic activation of IKKbeta in cells treated with TNF. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that the formation of IKK.PP2A complexes is required for the proper induction of IkappaB kinase activity in vivo."
10465067,The CDK9-associated cyclins T1 and T2 exert opposite effects on HIV-1 Tat activity.,"To examine the functional interaction between HIV-1 Tat protein and the cyclin T1 and T2 proteins which, in association with cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)9, are the regulatory subunits of the TAK/P-TEFb cellular complex strictly required for Tat transactivation."
15895093,Solution structure of the HIV-1 integrase-binding domain in LEDGF/p75.,"Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 is the dominant binding partner of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in human cells. We have determined the NMR structure of the integrase-binding domain (IBD) in LEDGF and identified amino acid residues essential for the interaction. The IBD is a compact right-handed bundle composed of five alpha-helices. Based on folding topology, the IBD is structurally related to a diverse family of alpha-helical proteins that includes eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4G and karyopherin-beta. LEDGF residues essential for the interaction with IN were localized to interhelical loop regions of the bundle structure. Interaction-defective IN mutants were previously shown to cripple replication although they retained catalytic function. The initial structure determination of a host cell factor that tightly binds to a retroviral enzyme lays the groundwork for understanding enzyme-host interactions important for viral replication."
17609285,Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ORF57 protein enhances mRNA accumulation independently of effects on nuclear RNA export.,"The ORF57 protein expressed by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) during lytic replication is essential for KSHV virion production. ORF57 enhances gene expression by increasing accumulation of target gene mRNAs. ORF57 interacts with the cellular export factor REF and with RNA, suggesting that it may provide target mRNAs with access to REF, which mediates nuclear RNA export by binding to TAP/NXF1. A mutational analysis of ORF57 was performed to study the role of REF binding, RNA interaction, and multimerization in ORF57 function. ORF57 was shown to directly bind RNA. The ability to bind REF did not correlate with ORF57 function in enhancing mRNA accumulation. ORF57 enhanced the nuclear levels of mRNA and PAN, a nuclear KSHV RNA, and the activity of various ORF57 mutants on the levels of mRNA paralleled their ability to enhance nuclear PAN accumulation, suggesting that ORF57 may also act on messenger RNAs by export-independent effects on RNA stability. Finally, an ORF57 mutant lacking a region homologous to a nucleolar localization signal in herpesvirus saimiri was constructed. This mutant retained function, demonstrating that, unlike the ORF57 homolog in herpesvirus saimiri, nucleolar trafficking is not required for ORF57 function in enhancing mRNA accumulation."
19535447,Identification of a novel WxSLVK motif in the N terminus of human immunodeficiency virus and simian immunodeficiency virus Vif that is critical for APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F neutralization.,"The function of lentiviral Vif proteins is to neutralize the host antiviral cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F). Vif bridges a cullin 5-based E3 ubiquitin ligase with A3G and A3F and mediates their degradation by proteasomes. Recent studies have found that Vif uses different domains to bind to A3G and A3F. A (14)DRMR(17) domain binds to A3F, (40)YRHHY(44) binds to A3G, and (69)YxxL(72) binds to both A3G and A3F. Here, we report another functional domain of Vif. Previously, we demonstrated that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif failed to mediate A3G proteasomal degradation when all 16 lysines were mutated to arginines. Here, we show that K26, and to a lesser extent K22, is critical for A3G neutralization. K22 and K26 are part of a conserved (21)WxSLVK(26) (x represents N, K, or H) motif that is found in most primate lentiviruses and that shows species-specific variation. Both K22 and K26 in this motif regulated Vif specificity only for A3G, whereas the SLV residues regulated Vif specificity for both A3F and A3G. Interestingly, SLV and K26 in HIV-1 Vif did not directly mediate Vif interaction with either A3G or A3F. Previously, other groups have reported an important role for W21 in A3F and A3G neutralization. Thus, (21)WxSLVK(26) is a novel functional domain that regulates Vif activity toward both A3F and A3G and is a potential drug target to inhibit Vif activity and block HIV-1 replication."
16260736,Structural basis for the recognition between HIV-1 integrase and transcriptional coactivator p75.,"Integrase (IN) is an essential retroviral enzyme, and human transcriptional coactivator p75, which is also referred to as lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF), is the dominant cellular binding partner of HIV-1 IN. Here, we report the crystal structure of the dimeric catalytic core domain of HIV-1 IN complexed to the IN-binding domain of LEDGF. Previously identified LEDGF hotspot residues anchor the protein to both monomers at the IN dimer interface. The principal structural features of IN that are recognized by the host factor are the backbone conformation of residues 168-171 from one monomer and a hydrophobic patch that is primarily comprised of alpha-helices 1 and 3 of the second IN monomer. Inspection of diverse retroviral primary and secondary sequence elements helps to explain the apparent lentiviral tropism of the LEDGF-IN interaction. Because the lethal phenotypes of HIV-1 mutant viruses unable to interact with LEDGF indicate that IN function is highly sensitive to perturbations of the structure around the LEDGF-binding site, we propose that small molecule inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction might similarly disrupt HIV-1 replication."
18439901,GGA and Arf proteins modulate retrovirus assembly and release.,"The Gag protein is the major structural determinant of retrovirus assembly. Although a number of cellular factors have been reported to facilitate retrovirus release, little is known about the cellular machinery that directs Gag to the site of virus assembly. Here, we report roles for the Golgi-localized gamma-ear containing Arf-binding (GGA) and ADP ribosylation factor (Arf) proteins in retrovirus particle assembly and release. Whereas siRNA-mediated depletion of GGA2 and GGA3 led to a significant increase in particle release in a late domain-dependent manner, GGA overexpression severely reduced retrovirus particle production by impairing Gag trafficking to the membrane. GGA overexpression inhibited retroviral assembly and release by disrupting Arf protein activity. Furthermore, disruption of endogenous Arf activity inhibited particle production by decreasing Gag-membrane binding. These findings identify the GGA proteins as modulators of HIV-1 release and the Arf proteins as critical cellular cofactors in retroviral Gag trafficking to the plasma membrane."
11427703,"Tsg101, a homologue of ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes, binds the L domain in HIV type 1 Pr55(Gag).","Ubiquitination appears to be involved in virus particle release from infected cells. Free ubiquitin (Ub), as well as Ub covalently bound to a small fraction of p6 Gag, is detected in mature HIV particles. Here we report that the p6 region in the Pr55(Gag) structural precursor polyprotein binds to Tsg101, a putative Ub regulator that is involved in trafficking of plasma membrane-associated proteins. Tsg101 was found to interact with Gag in (i) a yeast two-hybrid assay, (ii) in vitro coimmunoprecipitation by using purified Pr55(Gag) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate-synthesized Tsg101, and (iii) in vivo in the cytoplasm of COS cells transfected with gag. The PTAPP motif [or late (L) domain] within p6, which is required for release of mature virus from the plasma membrane, was the determinant for binding Pr55(Gag). The N-terminal region in Tsg101, which is homologous to the Ubc4 class of Ub-conjugating (E2) enzymes, was the determinant of interaction with p6. Mutation of Tyr-110 in Tsg101, present in place of the active-site Cys that binds Ub in E2 enzymes, and other residues unique to Tsg101, impaired p6 interaction, indicating that features that distinguish Tsg101 from active E2 enzymes were important for binding the viral protein. The results link L-domain function in HIV to the Ub machinery and a specific component of the cellular trafficking apparatus."
21304933,The ESCRT-0 component HRS is required for HIV-1 Vpu-mediated BST-2/tetherin down-regulation.,"The Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery, a highly conserved set of four hetero-oligomeric protein complexes, is required for multivesicular body formation, sorting ubiquitinylated membrane proteins for lysosomal degradation, cytokinesis and the final stages of assembly of a number of enveloped viruses, including the human immunodeficiency viruses. Here, we show an additional role for the ESCRT machinery in HIV-1 release. BST-2/tetherin is a restriction factor that impedes HIV release by tethering mature virus particles to the plasma membrane. We found that HRS, a key component of the ESCRT-0 complex, promotes efficient release of HIV-1 and that siRNA-mediated HRS depletion induces a BST-2/tetherin phenotype. This activity is related to the ability of the HIV-1 Vpu protein to down-regulate BST-2/tetherin. We found that BST-2/tetherin undergoes constitutive ESCRT-dependent sorting for lysosomal degradation and that this degradation is enhanced by Vpu expression. We demonstrate that Vpu-mediated BST-2/tetherin down-modulation and degradation require HRS (ESCRT-0) function and that knock down of HRS increases cellular levels of BST-2/tetherin and restricts virus release. Furthermore, HRS co-precipitates with Vpu and BST-2. Our results provide further insight into the mechanism by which Vpu counteracts BST-2/tetherin and promotes HIV-1 dissemination, and they highlight an additional role for the ESCRT machinery in virus release."
21159863,Basic residues in the nucleocapsid domain of Gag are critical for late events of HIV-1 budding.,"The p6 region of HIV-1 Gag contains two late (L) domains, PTAP and LYPXnL, that bind the cellular proteins Tsg101 and Alix, respectively. These interactions are thought to recruit members of the host fission machinery (ESCRT) to facilitate HIV-1 release. Here we report a new role for the p6-adjacent nucleocapsid (NC) domain in HIV-1 release. The mutation of basic residues in NC caused a pronounced decrease in virus release from 293T cells, although NC mutant Gag proteins retained the ability to interact with cellular membranes and RNAs. Remarkably, electron microscopy analyses of these mutants revealed arrested budding particles at the plasma membrane, analogous to those seen following the disruption of the PTAP motif. This result indicated that the basic residues in NC are important for virus budding. When analyzed in physiologically more relevant T-cell lines (Jurkat and CEM), NC mutant viruses remained tethered to the plasma membrane or to each other by a membranous stalk, suggesting membrane fission impairment. Remarkably, NC mutant release defects were alleviated by the coexpression of a Gag protein carrying a wild-type (WT) NC domain but devoid of all L domain motifs and by providing alternative access to the ESCRT pathway, through the in trans expression of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4.2s. Since NC mutant Gag proteins retained the interaction with Tsg101, we concluded that NC mutant budding arrests might have resulted from the inability of Gag to recruit or utilize members of the host ESCRT machinery that act downstream of Tsg101. Together, these data support a model in which NC plays a critical role in HIV-1 budding."
16138902,The functionally exchangeable L domains in RSV and HIV-1 Gag direct particle release through pathways linked by Tsg101.,"The functionally exchangeable L domains of HIV-1 and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Gag bind Tsg101 and Nedd4, respectively. Tsg101 and Nedd4 function in endocytic trafficking, and studies show that expression of Tsg101 or Nedd4 fragments interfere with release of HIV-1 or RSV Gag, respectively, as virus-like particles (VLPs). To determine whether functional exchangeability reflects use of the same trafficking pathway, we tested the effect on RSV Gag release of co-expression with mutated forms of Vps4, Nedd4 and Tsg101. A dominant-negative mutant of Vps4A, an AAA ATPase required for utilization of endosomal sorting proteins that was shown previously to interfere with HIV-1 budding, also inhibited RSV Gag release, indicating that RSV uses the endocytic trafficking machinery, as does HIV. Nedd4 and Tsg101 interacted in the presence or absence of Gag and, through its binding of Nedd4, RSV Gag interacted with Tsg101. Deletion of the N-terminal region of Tsg101 or the HECT domain of Nedd4 did not prevent interaction; however, three-dimensional spatial imaging suggested that the interaction of RSV Gag with full-length Tsg101 and N-terminally truncated Tsg101 was not the same. Co-expression of RSV Gag with the Tsg101 C-terminal fragment interfered with VLP release minimally; however, a significant fraction of the released VLPs was tethered to each other. The results suggest that, while Tsg101 is not required for RSV VLP release, alterations in the protein interfere with VLP budding/fission events. We conclude that RSV and HIV-1 Gag direct particle release through independent ESCRT-mediated pathways that are linked through Tsg101-Nedd4 interaction."
19588889,Molecular structure and biochemical properties of the HCCH-Zn2+ site in HIV-1 Vif.,"Virion infectivity factor (Vif) is an HIV accessory protein that is essential for the infection of CD4(+) T cells. Vif recruits a Cullin 5 (Cul5)-based ubiquitin ligase that targets a host cytidine deaminase, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G), for proteasomal degradation. The Vif N-terminus binds APOBEC3G, and the C-terminus interacts with the Cul5-based ubiquitin ligase machinery. Within the C-terminus, a highly conserved H(108)-X(5)-C(114)-X(17-18)-C(133)-X(3-5)-H(139) (HCCH) motif binds zinc and is implicated in the Vif-Cul5 interaction. We have employed the biomimetic peptide HCCHp (HIV-1 Vif amino acids 101-142) in order to determine the zinc ligands and investigate the role of zinc binding in Cul5 recognition. Using CD spectroscopy, a competitive zinc binding assay, and a light scattering assay, we found that mutation of the conserved His and Cys residues in HCCHp had little effect on secondary structure but reduced zinc binding affinity and altered the aggregation properties of the peptides. X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to study zinc coordination in wild-type HCCHp. The data are consistent with S(2)N(imid)(2) coordination and strongly suggest that His-108, Cys-114, Cys-133, and His-139 are zinc ligands. Mutation of one or both conserved Cys residues in HCCHp led to a decrease in Cys ligation, and an increase in the number of (N, O) ligands, with noninteger coordination numbers suggesting zinc site heterogeneity. A purified fragment of human Cul5 was found to inhibit zinc-induced aggregation of HCCHp, and pull-down experiments revealed that zinc binding to HCCHp increases the strength of the HCCHp-Cul5 interaction by 8-fold."
20220118,Chim3 confers survival advantage to CD4+ T cells upon HIV-1 infection by preventing HIV-1 DNA integration and HIV-1-induced G2 cell-cycle delay.,"The long-term expression and the ability of a therapeutic gene to confer survival advantage to transduced cells are mandatory requirements for successful anti-HIV gene therapy. In this context, we developed lentiviral vectors (LVs) expressing the F12-viral infectivity factor (Vif) derivative Chim3. We recently showed that Chim3 inhibits HIV-1 replication in primary cells by both blocking the accumulation of retrotranscripts, independently of either human APOBEC3G (hA3G) or Vif, and by preserving the antiviral function of hA3G. These results were predictive of long-lasting survival of Chim3(+) cells after HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, Vif, like Vpr, deregulates cell-cycle progression by inducing a delay in G(2) phase. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of Chim3 on both cell survival and cell-cycle regulation after HIV-1 infection. Here, we provide evidence that infected Chim3(+) T cells prevail over either mock- or empty-LV engineered cells, show reduced G(2) accumulation, and, as a consequence, ultimately extend their lifespan. Based on these findings, Chim3 rightly belongs to the most efficacious class of antiviral genes. In conclusion, Chim3 usage in anti-HIV gene therapy based on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) modification has to be considered as a promising therapeutic intervention to eventually cope with HIV-1 infection."
17531282,Ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of interferon regulatory factor-3 induced by Npro from a cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus.,"The pathogenesis of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infections is complex and only partly understood. It remains controversial whether interferon is produced in cells infected with cytopathic(cp) BVDVs which do not persist in vivo. We show here that a cpBVDV (NADL strain) does not induce interferon responses in cell culture and blocks induction of interferon-stimulated genes by a super-infecting paramyxovirus. cpBVDV infection causes a marked loss of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a cellular transcription factor that controls interferon synthesis. This is attributed to expression of Npro, but not its protease activity. Npro interacts with IRF-3, prior to its activation by virus-induced phosphorylation, resulting in polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of IRF-3. Thermal inactivation of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme prevents Npro-induced IRF-3 loss. These data suggest that inhibition of interferon production is a shared feature of both ncp and cpBVDVs and provide new insights regarding IRF-3 regulation in pestivirus pathogenesis."
16530520,The SH3 binding motif of HCV [corrected] NS5A protein interacts with Bin1 and is important for apoptosis and infectivity.,HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) has been implicated in regulating cell growth and interferon response. The NS5A protein contains proline-rich regions that are highly conserved among HCV genotypes and match Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding motifs (PxxP) found in various cellular signaling molecules.
19605477,The hepatitis C virus core protein contains a BH3 domain that regulates apoptosis through specific interaction with human Mcl-1.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is known to modulate apoptosis and contribute to viral replication and pathogenesis. In this study, we have identified a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain in the core protein that is essential for its proapoptotic property. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that the core protein interacts specifically with the human myeloid cell factor 1 (Mcl-1), a prosurvival member of the Bcl-2 family, but not with other prosurvival members (Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-w). Moreover, the overexpression of Mcl-1 protects against core-induced apoptosis. By using peptide mimetics, core was found to release cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria when complemented with Bad. Thus, core is a bona fide BH3-only protein having properties similar to those of Noxa, a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family that binds preferentially to Mcl-1. There are three critical hydrophobic residues in the BH3 domain of the core protein, and they are essential for the proapoptotic property of the core protein. Furthermore, the genotype 1b core protein is more effective than the genotype 2a core protein in inducing apoptosis due to a single-amino-acid difference at one of these hydrophobic residues (residue 119). Replacing this residue in the J6/JFH-1 infectious clone (genotype 2a) with the corresponding amino acid in the genotype 1b core protein produced a mutant virus, J6/JFH-1(V119L), which induced significantly higher levels of apoptosis in the infected cells than the parental J6/JFH-1 virus. Furthermore, the core protein of J6/JFH-1(V119L), but not that of J6/JFH-1, interacted with Mcl-1 in virus-infected cells. Taken together, the core protein is a novel BH3-only viral homologue that contributes to the induction of apoptosis during HCV infection."
20862261,Hepatitis C virus core-derived peptides inhibit genotype 1b viral genome replication via interaction with DDX3X.,"The protein DDX3X is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that is essential for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle. The HCV core protein has been shown to bind to DDX3X both in vitro and in vivo. However, the specific interactions between these two proteins and the functional importance of these interactions for the HCV viral life cycle remain unclear. We show that amino acids 16-36 near the N-terminus of the HCV core protein interact specifically with DDX3X both in vitro and in vivo. Replication of HCV replicon NNeo/C-5B RNA (genotype 1b) is significantly suppressed in HuH-7-derived cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions to HCV core protein residues 16-36, but not by GFP fusions to core protein residues 16-35 or 16-34. Notably, the inhibition of HCV replication due to expression of the GFP fusion to HCV core protein residues 16-36 can be reversed by overexpression of DDX3X. These results suggest that the protein interface on DDX3X that binds the HCV core protein is important for replicon maintenance. However, infection of HuH-7 cells by HCV viruses of genotype 2a (JFH1) was not affected by expression of the GFP fusion protein. These results suggest that the role of DDX3X in HCV infection involves aspects of the viral life cycle that vary in importance between HCV genotypes."
23320542,Evidence for self-association of the alternative sigma factor σ54.,"Sigma factor σ(54) has a distinct modus operandi for mediating the activation of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) at promoter recognition motifs 12 and 24 bp upstream from transcription start sites. σ(54) was thought to act as monomer in all transcription steps. However, we provide evidence that σ(54) of Pseudomonas putida interacts stably with itself. The interface between monomers involves contacts in σ(54) regions I and III, sequences that play key roles in the transcription activation of σ(54)-RNAP holoenzyme. These roles include interactions with activator proteins and the -12 and -24 motifs. In particular, we detected inter-monomer contacts between region I, and between region I and the C-terminal portion of region III. Our results suggest a new auto-antagonistic regulatory state of σ(54)."
15292184,Hepatitis C virus core selectively suppresses interleukin-12 synthesis in human macrophages by interfering with AP-1 activation.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is remarkably efficient at establishing persistent infection, suggesting that it has evolved one or more strategies aimed at evading the host immune response. T cell responses, including interferon-gamma production, are severely suppressed in chronic HCV patients. The HCV core protein has been previously shown to circulate in the bloodstream of HCV-infected patients and inhibit host immunity through an interaction with gC1qR. To determine the role of the HCV core-gC1qR interaction in modulation of inflammatory cytokine production, we examined interleukin (IL)-12 production, which is critical for the induction of interferon-gamma synthesis, in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocyte/macrophages. We found that core protein binds the gC1qR displayed on the cell surface of monocyte/macrophages and inhibits the production of IL-12p70 upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. This inhibition was found to be selective in that HCV core failed to affect the production of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In addition, suppression of IL-12 production by core protein occurred at the transcriptional level by inhibition of IL-12p40 mRNA synthesis. Importantly, core-induced inhibition of IL-12p40 mRNA synthesis resulted from impaired activation of AP-1 rather than enhanced IL-10 production. These results suggest that the HCV core-gC1qR interaction may play a pivotal role in establishing persistent infection by dampening TH1 responses."
24825900,Functional and structural properties of a novel protein and virulence factor (Protein sHIP) in Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is a significant bacterial pathogen in the human population. The importance of virulence factors for the survival and colonization of S. pyogenes is well established, and many of these factors are exposed to the extracellular environment, enabling bacterial interactions with the host. In the present study, we quantitatively analyzed and compared S. pyogenes proteins in the growth medium of a strain that is virulent to mice with a non-virulent strain. Particularly, one of these proteins was present at significantly higher levels in stationary growth medium from the virulent strain. We determined the three-dimensional structure of the protein that showed a unique tetrameric organization composed of four helix-loop-helix motifs. Affinity pull-down mass spectrometry analysis in human plasma demonstrated that the protein interacts with histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), and the name sHIP (streptococcal histidine-rich glycoprotein-interacting protein) is therefore proposed. HRG has antibacterial activity, and when challenged by HRG, sHIP was found to rescue S. pyogenes bacteria. This and the finding that patients with invasive S. pyogenes infection respond with antibody production against sHIP suggest a role for the protein in S. pyogenes pathogenesis."
12900394,HIV Gag mimics the Tsg101-recruiting activity of the human Hrs protein.,"The HIV-1 Gag protein recruits the cellular factor Tsg101 to facilitate the final stages of virus budding. A conserved P(S/T)AP tetrapeptide motif within Gag (the ""late domain"") binds directly to the NH2-terminal ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain of Tsg101. In the cell, Tsg101 is required for biogenesis of vesicles that bud into the lumen of late endosomal compartments called multivesicular bodies (MVBs). However, the mechanism by which Tsg101 is recruited from the cytoplasm onto the endosomal membrane has not been known. Now, we report that Tsg101 binds the COOH-terminal region of the endosomal protein hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs; residues 222-777). This interaction is mediated, in part, by binding of the Tsg101 UEV domain to the Hrs 348PSAP351 motif. Importantly, Hrs222-777 can recruit Tsg101 and rescue the budding of virus-like Gag particles that are missing native late domains. These observations indicate that Hrs normally functions to recruit Tsg101 to the endosomal membrane. HIV-1 Gag apparently mimics this Hrs activity, and thereby usurps Tsg101 and other components of the MVB vesicle fission machinery to facilitate viral budding."
11595185,Tsg101 and the vacuolar protein sorting pathway are essential for HIV-1 budding.,"Like other enveloped viruses, HIV-1 uses cellular machinery to bud from infected cells. We now show that Tsg101 protein, which functions in vacuolar protein sorting (Vps), is required for HIV-1 budding. The UEV domain of Tsg101 binds to an essential tetrapeptide (PTAP) motif within the p6 domain of the structural Gag protein and also to ubiquitin. Depletion of cellular Tsg101 by small interfering RNA arrests HIV-1 budding at a late stage, and budding is rescued by reintroduction of Tsg101. Dominant negative mutant Vps4 proteins that inhibit vacuolar protein sorting also arrest HIV-1 and MLV budding. These observations suggest that retroviruses bud by appropriating cellular machinery normally used in the Vps pathway to form multivesicular bodies."
21070952,Crystallographic and functional analysis of the ESCRT-I /HIV-1 Gag PTAP interaction.,"Budding of HIV-1 requires the binding of the PTAP late domain of the Gag p6 protein to the UEV domain of the TSG101 subunit of ESCRT-I. The normal function of this motif in cells is in receptor downregulation. Here, we report the 1.4-1.6 Å structures of the human TSG101 UEV domain alone and with wild-type and mutant HIV-1 PTAP and Hrs PSAP nonapeptides. The hydroxyl of the Thr or Ser residue in the P(S/T)AP motif hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Asn69. Mutation of the Asn to Pro, blocking the main-chain amide, abrogates PTAP motif binding in vitro and blocks budding of HIV-1 from cells. N69P and other PTAP binding-deficient alleles of TSG101 did not rescue HIV-1 budding. However, the mutant alleles did rescue downregulation of endogenous EGF receptor. This demonstrates that the PSAP motif is not rate determining in EGF receptor downregulation under normal conditions."
12006492,Structure and functional interactions of the Tsg101 UEV domain.,"Human Tsg101 plays key roles in HIV budding and in cellular vacuolar protein sorting (VPS). In performing these functions, Tsg101 binds both ubiquitin (Ub) and the PTAP tetrapeptide 'late domain' motif located within the viral Gag protein. These interactions are mediated by the N-terminal domain of Tsg101, which belongs to the catalytically inactive ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) family. We now report the structure of Tsg101 UEV and chemical shift mapping of the Ub and PTAP binding sites. Tsg101 UEV resembles canonical E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, but has an additional N-terminal helix, an extended beta-hairpin that links strands 1 and 2, and lacks the two C-terminal helices normally found in E2 enzymes. PTAP-containing peptides bind in a hydrophobic cleft exposed by the absence of the C-terminal helices, whereas ubiquitin binds in a novel site surrounding the beta-hairpin. These studies provide a structural framework for understanding how Tsg101 mediates the protein-protein interactions required for HIV budding and VPS."
23098073,Core-binding factor β increases the affinity between human Cullin 5 and HIV-1 Vif within an E3 ligase complex.,"HIV-1 Vif masquerades as a receptor for a cellular E3 ligase harboring Elongin B, Elongin C, and Cullin 5 (EloB/C/Cul5) proteins that facilitate degradation of the antiretroviral factor APOBEC3G (A3G). This Vif-mediated activity requires human core-binding factor β (CBFβ) in contrast to cellular substrate receptors. We observed calorimetrically that Cul5 binds tighter to full-length Vif((1-192))/EloB/C/CBFβ (K(d) = 5 ± 2 nM) than to Vif((95-192))/EloB/C (K(d) = 327 ± 40 nM), which cannot bind CBFβ. A comparison of heat capacity changes supports a model in which CBFβ prestabilizes Vif((1-192)) relative to Vif((95-192)), consistent with a stronger interaction of Cul5 with Vif's C-terminal Zn(2+)-binding motif. An additional interface between Cul5 and an N-terminal region of Vif appears to be plausible, which has therapeutic design implications."
12379843,Structure of the Tsg101 UEV domain in complex with the PTAP motif of the HIV-1 p6 protein.,"The structural proteins of HIV and Ebola display PTAP peptide motifs (termed 'late domains') that recruit the human protein Tsg101 to facilitate virus budding. Here we present the solution structure of the UEV (ubiquitin E2 variant) binding domain of Tsg101 in complex with a PTAP peptide that spans the late domain of HIV-1 p6(Gag). The UEV domain of Tsg101 resembles E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and the PTAP peptide binds in a bifurcated groove above the vestigial enzyme active site. Each PTAP residue makes important contacts, and the Ala 9-Pro 10 dipeptide binds in a deep pocket of the UEV domain that resembles the X-Pro binding pockets of SH3 and WW domains. The structure reveals the molecular basis of HIV PTAP late domain function and represents an attractive starting point for the design of novel inhibitors of virus budding."
23499434,Reversible redox regulation of specificity of Arg-gingipain B in Porphyromonas gingivalis.,"Arg-gingipain B (RgpB), a major virulence factor secreted by the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis is an Arg-specific cysteine proteinase. By monitoring proteolytic cleavage of a human salivary peptide histatin 5 using MALDI-TOF MS, RgpB purified from P. gingivalis HG66 was found to shift from a dominant Arg-X to dominant Lys-X activity, both in vitro and in vivo, upon reversible cysteine oxidation. Native PAGE analysis revealed the association of novel Lys-X activity with a reversible state change of the oxidized enzyme. The redox-regulated Lys-X activity of RgpB may provide a survival advantage to P. gingivalis against the oxidative host defence."
12970408,Proteasome activator PA28gamma-dependent nuclear retention and degradation of hepatitis C virus core protein.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein plays an important role in the formation of the viral nucleocapsid and a regulatory protein involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. In this study, we have identified proteasome activator PA28gamma (11S regulator gamma) as an HCV core binding protein by using yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction was demonstrated not only in cell culture but also in the livers of HCV core transgenic mice. These findings are extended to human HCV infection by the observation of this interaction in liver specimens from a patient with chronic HCV infection. Neither the interaction of HCV core protein with other PA28 subtypes nor that of PA28gamma with other Flavivirus core proteins was detected. Deletion of the PA28gamma-binding region from the HCV core protein or knockout of the PA28gamma gene led to the export of the HCV core protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of PA28gamma enhanced the proteolysis of the HCV core protein. Thus, the nuclear retention and stability of the HCV core protein is regulated via a PA28gamma-dependent pathway through which HCV pathogenesis may be exerted."
24284321,Cellular vimentin regulates construction of dengue virus replication complexes through interaction with NS4A protein.,"Dengue virus (DENV) interacts with host cellular factors to construct a more favorable environment for replication, and the interplay between DENV and the host cellular cytoskeleton may represent one of the potential antiviral targeting sites. However, the involvement of cellular vimentin intermediate filaments in DENV replication has been explored less. Here, we revealed the direct interaction between host cellular vimentin and DENV nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A), a known component of the viral replication complex (RC), during DENV infection using tandem affinity purification, coimmunoprecipitation, and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the dynamics of vimentin-NS4A interaction were demonstrated by using confocal three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and proximity ligation assay. Most importantly, we report for the first time the discovery of the specific region of NS4A that interacts with vimentin lies within the first 50 amino acid residues at the cytosolic N-terminal domain of NS4A (N50 region). Besides identifying vimentin-NS4A interaction, vimentin reorganization and phosphorylation by calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II occurs during DENV infection, signifying that vimentin reorganization is important in maintaining and supporting the DENV RCs. Interestingly, we found that gene silencing of vimentin by small interfering RNA induced a significant alteration in the distribution of RCs in DENV-infected cells. This finding further supports the crucial role of intact vimentin scaffold in localizing and concentrating DENV RCs at the perinuclear site, thus facilitating efficient viral RNA replication. Collectively, our findings implicate the biological and functional significance of vimentin during DENV replication, as we propose that the association of DENV RCs with vimentin is mediated by DENV NS4A."
22028648,An integrated approach to elucidate the intra-viral and viral-cellular protein interaction networks of a gamma-herpesvirus.,"Genome-wide yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens were conducted to elucidate the molecular functions of open reading frames (ORFs) encoded by murine γ-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68). A library of 84 MHV-68 genes and gene fragments was generated in a Gateway entry plasmid and transferred to Y2H vectors. All possible pair-wise interactions between viral proteins were tested in the Y2H assay, resulting in the identification of 23 intra-viral protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Seventy percent of the interactions between viral proteins were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. To systematically investigate virus-cellular protein interactions, the MHV-68 Y2H constructs were screened against a cellular cDNA library, yielding 243 viral-cellular PPIs involving 197 distinct cellar proteins. Network analyses indicated that cellular proteins targeted by MHV-68 had more partners in the cellular PPI network and were located closer to each other than expected by chance. Taking advantage of this observation, we scored the cellular proteins based on their network distances from other MHV-68-interacting proteins and segregated them into high (Y2H-HP) and low priority/not-scored (Y2H-LP/NS) groups. Significantly more genes from Y2H-HP altered MHV-68 replication when their expression was inhibited with siRNAs (53% of genes from Y2H-HP, 21% of genes from Y2H-LP/NS, and 16% of genes randomly chosen from the human PPI network; p<0.05). Enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the Y2H-HP group included regulation of apoptosis, protein kinase cascade, post-translational protein modification, transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, and IκB kinase/NFκB cascade. Functional validation assays indicated that PCBP1, which interacted with MHV-68 ORF34, may be involved in regulating late virus gene expression in a manner consistent with the effects of its viral interacting partner. Our study integrated Y2H screening with multiple functional validation approaches to create γ-herpes viral-viral and viral-cellular protein interaction networks."
10074132,Hepatitis C virus core protein interacts with cellular putative RNA helicase.,"The nucleocapsid core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to trans-act on several viral or cellular promoters. To get insight into the trans-action mechanism of HCV core protein, a yeast two-hybrid cloning system was used for identification of core protein-interacting cellular protein. One such cDNA clone encoding the DEAD box family of putative RNA helicase was obtained. This cellular putative RNA helicase, designated CAP-Rf, exhibits more than 95% amino acid sequence identity to other known RNA helicases including human DBX and DBY, mouse mDEAD3, and PL10, a family of proteins generally involved in translation, splicing, development, or cell growth. In vitro binding or in vivo coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated the direct interaction of the full-length/matured form and C-terminally truncated variants of HCV core protein with this targeted protein. Additionally, the protein's interaction domains were delineated at the N-terminal 40-amino-acid segment of the HCV core protein and the C-terminal tail of CAP-Rf, which encompassed its RNA-binding and ATP hydrolysis domains. Immunoblotting or indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the endogenous CAP-Rf was mainly localized in the nucleus and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm, and when fused with FLAG tag, it colocalized with the HCV core protein either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. Similar to other RNA helicases, this cellular RNA helicase has nucleoside triphosphatase-deoxynucleoside triphosphatase activity, but this activity is inhibited by various forms of homopolynucleotides and enhanced by the HCV core protein. Moreover, transient expression of HCV core protein in human hepatoma HuH-7 cells significantly potentiated the trans-activation effect of FLAG-tagged CAP-Rf or untagged CAP-Rf on the luciferase reporter plasmid activity. All together, our results indicate that CAP-Rf is involved in regulation of gene expression and that HCV core protein promotes the trans-activation ability of CAP-Rf, likely via the complex formation and the modulation of the ATPase-dATPase activity of CAP-Rf. These findings provide evidence that HCV may have evolved a distinct mechanism in alteration of host cellular gene expression regulation via the interaction of its nucleocapsid core protein and cellular putative RNA helicase known to participate in all aspects of cellular processes involving RNA metabolism. This feature of core protein may impart pleiotropic effects on host cells, which may partially account for its role in HCV pathogenesis."
24446487,E2~Ub conjugates regulate the kinase activity of Shigella effector OspG during pathogenesis.,"Pathogenic bacteria introduce effector proteins directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells to promote invasion and colonization. OspG, a Shigella spp. effector kinase, plays a role in this process by helping to suppress the host inflammatory response. OspG has been reported to bind host E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes activated with ubiquitin (E2~Ub), a key enzyme complex in ubiquitin transfer pathways. A co-crystal structure of the OspG/UbcH5c~Ub complex reveals that complex formation has important ramifications for the activity of both OspG and the UbcH5c~Ub conjugate. OspG is a minimal kinase domain containing only essential elements required for catalysis. UbcH5c~Ub binding stabilizes an active conformation of the kinase, greatly enhancing OspG kinase activity. In contrast, interaction with OspG stabilizes an extended, less reactive form of UbcH5c~Ub. Recognizing conserved E2 features, OspG can interact with at least ten distinct human E2s~Ub. Mouse oral infection studies indicate that E2~Ub conjugates act as novel regulators of OspG effector kinase function in eukaryotic host cells."
25464832,Influenza virus-host interactome screen as a platform for antiviral drug development.,"Host factors required for viral replication are ideal drug targets because they are less likely than viral proteins to mutate under drug-mediated selective pressure. Although genome-wide screens have identified host proteins involved in influenza virus replication, limited mechanistic understanding of how these factors affect influenza has hindered potential drug development. We conducted a systematic analysis to identify and validate host factors that associate with influenza virus proteins and affect viral replication. After identifying over 1,000 host factors that coimmunoprecipitate with specific viral proteins, we generated a network of virus-host protein interactions based on the stage of the viral life cycle affected upon host factor downregulation. Using compounds that inhibit these host factors, we validated several proteins, notably Golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) and JAK1, as potential antiviral drug targets. Thus, virus-host interactome screens are powerful strategies to identify targetable host factors and guide antiviral drug development."
22458338,Host-pathogen interactome mapping for HTLV-1 and -2 retroviruses.,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and type 2 both target T lymphocytes, yet induce radically different phenotypic outcomes. HTLV-1 is a causative agent of Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), whereas HTLV-2, highly similar to HTLV-1, causes no known overt disease. HTLV gene products are engaged in a dynamic struggle of activating and antagonistic interactions with host cells. Investigations focused on one or a few genes have identified several human factors interacting with HTLV viral proteins. Most of the available interaction data concern the highly investigated HTLV-1 Tax protein. Identifying shared and distinct host-pathogen protein interaction profiles for these two viruses would enlighten how they exploit distinctive or common strategies to subvert cellular pathways toward disease progression."
25036637,A quantitative chaperone interaction network reveals the architecture of cellular protein homeostasis pathways.,"Chaperones are abundant cellular proteins that promote the folding and function of their substrate proteins (clients). In vivo, chaperones also associate with a large and diverse set of cofactors (cochaperones) that regulate their specificity and function. However, how these cochaperones regulate protein folding and whether they have chaperone-independent biological functions is largely unknown. We combined mass spectrometry and quantitative high-throughput LUMIER assays to systematically characterize the chaperone-cochaperone-client interaction network in human cells. We uncover hundreds of chaperone clients, delineate their participation in specific cochaperone complexes, and establish a surprisingly distinct network of protein-protein interactions for cochaperones. As a salient example of the power of such analysis, we establish that NUDC family cochaperones specifically associate with structurally related but evolutionarily distinct β-propeller folds. We provide a framework for deciphering the proteostasis network and its regulation in development and disease and expand the use of chaperones as sensors for drug-target engagement."
25158218,Elucidation of the Ebola virus VP24 cellular interactome and disruption of virus biology through targeted inhibition of host-cell protein function.,"Viral pathogenesis in the infected cell is a balance between antiviral responses and subversion of host-cell processes. Many viral proteins specifically interact with host-cell proteins to promote virus biology. Understanding these interactions can lead to knowledge gains about infection and provide potential targets for antiviral therapy. One such virus is Ebola, which has profound consequences for human health and causes viral hemorrhagic fever where case fatality rates can approach 90%. The Ebola virus VP24 protein plays a critical role in the evasion of the host immune response and is likely to interact with multiple cellular proteins. To map these interactions and better understand the potential functions of VP24, label-free quantitative proteomics was used to identify cellular proteins that had a high probability of forming the VP24 cellular interactome. Several known interactions were confirmed, thus placing confidence in the technique, but new interactions were also discovered including one with ATP1A1, which is involved in osmoregulation and cell signaling. Disrupting the activity of ATP1A1 in Ebola-virus-infected cells with a small molecule inhibitor resulted in a decrease in progeny virus, thus illustrating how quantitative proteomics can be used to identify potential therapeutic targets."
22014111,Flavivirus NS3 and NS5 proteins interaction network: a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen.,"The genus Flavivirus encompasses more than 50 distinct species of arthropod-borne viruses, including several major human pathogens, such as West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and the four serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV type 1-4). Each year, flaviviruses cause more than 100 million infections worldwide, some of which lead to life-threatening conditions such as encephalitis or haemorrhagic fever. Among the viral proteins, NS3 and NS5 proteins constitute the major enzymatic components of the viral replication complex and are essential to the flavivirus life cycle."
21994455,Generation and comprehensive analysis of an influenza virus polymerase cellular interaction network.,"The influenza virus transcribes and replicates its genome inside the nucleus of infected cells. Both activities are performed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is composed of the three subunits PA, PB1, and PB2, and recent studies have shown that it requires host cell factors to transcribe and replicate the viral genome. To identify these cellular partners, we generated a comprehensive physical interaction map between each polymerase subunit and the host cellular proteome. A total of 109 human interactors were identified by yeast two-hybrid screens, whereas 90 were retrieved by literature mining. We built the FluPol interactome network composed of the influenza virus polymerase (PA, PB1, and PB2) and the nucleoprotein NP and 234 human proteins that are connected through 279 viral-cellular protein interactions. Analysis of this interactome map revealed enriched cellular functions associated with the influenza virus polymerase, including host factors involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription and mRNA processing. We confirmed that eight influenza virus polymerase-interacting proteins are required for virus replication and transcriptional activity of the viral polymerase. These are involved in cellular transcription (C14orf166, COPS5, MNAT1, NMI, and POLR2A), translation (EIF3S6IP), nuclear transport (NUP54), and DNA repair (FANCG). Conversely, we identified PRKRA, which acts as an inhibitor of the viral polymerase transcriptional activity and thus is required for the cellular antiviral response."
22761572,Large scale genotype comparison of human papillomavirus E2-host interaction networks provides new insights for e2 molecular functions.,"Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) cause widespread infections in humans, resulting in latent infections or diseases ranging from benign hyperplasia to cancers. HPV-induced pathologies result from complex interplays between viral proteins and the host proteome. Given the major public health concern due to HPV-associated cancers, most studies have focused on the early proteins expressed by HPV genotypes with high oncogenic potential (designated high-risk HPV or HR-HPV). To advance the global understanding of HPV pathogenesis, we mapped the virus/host interaction networks of the E2 regulatory protein from 12 genotypes representative of the range of HPV pathogenicity. Large-scale identification of E2-interaction partners was performed by yeast two-hybrid screenings of a HaCaT cDNA library. Based on a high-confidence scoring scheme, a subset of these partners was then validated for pair-wise interaction in mammalian cells with the whole range of the 12 E2 proteins, allowing a comparative interaction analysis. Hierarchical clustering of E2-host interaction profiles mostly recapitulated HPV phylogeny and provides clues to the involvement of E2 in HPV infection. A set of cellular proteins could thus be identified discriminating, among the mucosal HPV, E2 proteins of HR-HPV 16 or 18 from the non-oncogenic genital HPV. The study of the interaction networks revealed a preferential hijacking of highly connected cellular proteins and the targeting of several functional families. These include transcription regulation, regulation of apoptosis, RNA processing, ubiquitination and intracellular trafficking. The present work provides an overview of E2 biological functions across multiple HPV genotypes."
23950709,A systematic analysis of host factors reveals a Med23-interferon-λ regulatory axis against herpes simplex virus type 1 replication.,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus causing vesicular oral or genital skin lesions, meningitis and other diseases particularly harmful in immunocompromised individuals. To comprehensively investigate the complex interaction between HSV-1 and its host we combined two genome-scale screens for host factors (HFs) involved in virus replication. A yeast two-hybrid screen for protein interactions and a RNA interference (RNAi) screen with a druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library confirmed existing and identified novel HFs which functionally influence HSV-1 infection. Bioinformatic analyses found the 358 HFs were enriched for several pathways and multi-protein complexes. Of particular interest was the identification of Med23 as a strongly anti-viral component of the largely pro-viral Mediator complex, which links specific transcription factors to RNA polymerase II. The anti-viral effect of Med23 on HSV-1 replication was confirmed in gain-of-function gene overexpression experiments, and this inhibitory effect was specific to HSV-1, as a range of other viruses including Vaccinia virus and Semliki Forest virus were unaffected by Med23 depletion. We found Med23 significantly upregulated expression of the type III interferon family (IFN-λ) at the mRNA and protein level by directly interacting with the transcription factor IRF7. The synergistic effect of Med23 and IRF7 on IFN-λ induction suggests this is the major transcription factor for IFN-λ expression. Genotypic analysis of patients suffering recurrent orofacial HSV-1 outbreaks, previously shown to be deficient in IFN-λ secretion, found a significant correlation with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IFN-λ3 (IL28b) promoter strongly linked to Hepatitis C disease and treatment outcome. This paper describes a link between Med23 and IFN-λ, provides evidence for the crucial role of IFN-λ in HSV-1 immune control, and highlights the power of integrative genome-scale approaches to identify HFs critical for disease progression and outcome."
22898364,Comparative analysis of virus-host interactomes with a mammalian high-throughput protein complementation assay based on Gaussia princeps luciferase.,"Comparative interactomics is a strategy for inferring potential interactions among orthologous proteins or ""interologs"". Herein we focus, in contrast to standard homology-based inference, on the divergence of protein interaction profiles among closely related organisms, showing that the approach can correlate specific traits to phenotypic differences. As a model, this new comparative interactomic approach was applied at a large scale to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) proteins. The oncogenic potential of HPVs is mainly determined by the E6 and E7 early proteins. We have mapped and overlapped the virus-host protein interaction networks of E6 and E7 proteins from 11 distinct HPV genotypes, selected for their different tropisms and pathologies. We generated robust and comprehensive datasets by combining two orthogonal protein interaction assays: yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), and our recently described ""high-throughput Gaussia princeps protein complementation assay"" (HT-GPCA). HT-GPCA detects protein interaction by measuring the interaction-mediated reconstitution of activity of a split G. princeps luciferase. Hierarchical clustering of interaction profiles recapitulated HPV phylogeny and was used to correlate specific virus-host interaction profiles with pathological traits, reflecting the distinct carcinogenic potentials of different HPVs. This comparative interactomics constitutes a reliable and powerful strategy to decipher molecular relationships in virtually any combination of microorganism-host interactions."
22810586,Interpreting cancer genomes using systematic host network perturbations by tumour virus proteins.,"Genotypic differences greatly influence susceptibility and resistance to disease. Understanding genotype-phenotype relationships requires that phenotypes be viewed as manifestations of network properties, rather than simply as the result of individual genomic variations. Genome sequencing efforts have identified numerous germline mutations, and large numbers of somatic genomic alterations, associated with a predisposition to cancer. However, it remains difficult to distinguish background, or 'passenger', cancer mutations from causal, or 'driver', mutations in these data sets. Human viruses intrinsically depend on their host cell during the course of infection and can elicit pathological phenotypes similar to those arising from mutations. Here we test the hypothesis that genomic variations and tumour viruses may cause cancer through related mechanisms, by systematically examining host interactome and transcriptome network perturbations caused by DNA tumour virus proteins. The resulting integrated viral perturbation data reflects rewiring of the host cell networks, and highlights pathways, such as Notch signalling and apoptosis, that go awry in cancer. We show that systematic analyses of host targets of viral proteins can identify cancer genes with a success rate on a par with their identification through functional genomics and large-scale cataloguing of tumour mutations. Together, these complementary approaches increase the specificity of cancer gene identification. Combining systems-level studies of pathogen-encoded gene products with genomic approaches will facilitate the prioritization of cancer-causing driver genes to advance the understanding of the genetic basis of human cancer."
12743284,Hepatitis B virus X protein and simian virus 5 V protein exhibit similar UV-DDB1 binding properties to mediate distinct activities.,"The UV-damaged DNA-binding activity protein (UV-DDB) consists of two subunits, DDB1 and DDB2, and functions in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. The DDB1 subunit is a target for the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx). Binding of HBx to DDB1 interferes with cell growth and viability in culture and has been implicated in the establishment of viral infection. DDB1 also interacts with the V proteins encoded by several paramyxoviruses including simian virus 5 (SV5), which prevent interferon signaling by targeting either STAT1 or STAT2 proteins for proteolysis. The role of V binding to DDB1, however, remains unclear. Here we show that the V protein of SV5 (SV5-V) and HBx exhibit strikingly similar DDB1 binding properties. Thus, SV5-V and HBx bind to DDB1 in a mutually exclusive manner, and SV5-V shares with HBx the ability to enhance the steady-state levels of DDB1 and to inhibit its association with DDB2. Yet only HBx induces cell death, and SV5-V can prevent HBx from doing so by blocking its interaction with DDB1. Binding of SV5-V to DDB1 may serve another function, since SV5-V shows a decreased ability to induce STAT1 degradation in cells expressing reduced amounts of DDB1. These findings demonstrate that HBx performs a unique function through its association with DDB1 for which SV5-V cannot substitute and suggest that SV5-V and HBx have evolved to bind DDB1 to achieve distinct functions, both by a mechanism that does not involve DDB2."
22761553,Viral perturbations of host networks reflect disease etiology.,"Many human diseases, arising from mutations of disease susceptibility genes (genetic diseases), are also associated with viral infections (virally implicated diseases), either in a directly causal manner or by indirect associations. Here we examine whether viral perturbations of host interactome may underlie such virally implicated disease relationships. Using as models two different human viruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV), we find that host targets of viral proteins reside in network proximity to products of disease susceptibility genes. Expression changes in virally implicated disease tissues and comorbidity patterns cluster significantly in the network vicinity of viral targets. The topological proximity found between cellular targets of viral proteins and disease genes was exploited to uncover a novel pathway linking HPV to Fanconi anemia."
9151858,"Characterization of LMP-1's association with TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3.","The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) contributes to the immortalizing activity of EBV in primary, human B lymphocytes. LMP-1 is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it influences signaling pathways of infected cells. LMP-1 has been found to associate with members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of proteins. As with LMP-1, the TRAF molecules have been shown to participate in cell signaling pathways. We have characterized and mapped in detail a region of LMP-1 that associates with TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3. TRAF3 alone associates with LMP-1 in a yeast two-hybrid assay, whereas all three TRAF molecules associate with LMP-1 under various conditions when they are assayed in extracts of human cells. TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 appear to associate independently with LMP-1 but bind an overlapping target site. TRAF3 associates with LMP-1 most avidly and can compete with TRAF1 and TRAF2 for binding to LMP-1. TRAF2 associates with truncated derivatives of the carboxy terminus of LMP-1 more efficiently than with the intact terminus, indicating that LMP-1's conformation may regulate its association with TRAF2. Finally, point mutations that decrease LMP-1's association with the three TRAF molecules to 3 to 20% of wild-type levels do not detectably affect otherwise intact LMP-1's induction of NF-kappaB activity. Therefore, these associations are not necessary for the majority of intact LMP-1's induction of this signaling pathway."
19637933,Analysis of vaccinia virus-host protein-protein interactions: validations of yeast two-hybrid screenings.,"Vaccinia virus, a large double-stranded DNA virus, is the prototype of the Orthopoxvirus genus, which includes several pathogenic poxviruses of humans, such as monkeypox virus and variola virus. Here, we report a comprehensive yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening for the protein-protein interactions between vaccinia and human proteins. A total of 109 novel vaccinia-human protein interactions were detected among 33 viral proteins. To validate subsets of those interactions, we constructed an ORFeome library of vaccinia virus strain WR using the Gateway plasmid cloning system. By co-expressing selected vaccinia and host proteins in a variety of expression systems, we found that at least 17 of the Y2H hits identified between vaccinia and human proteins can be verified by independent methods using GST pull-down assays, representing a 63% validation rate for the Y2H hits examined (17/27). Because the cloned ORFs are conveniently transferable from the entry vectors to various destination expression vectors, the vaccinia ORFeome library will be a useful resource for future high-throughput functional proteomic experiments."

11080803,Pleiotropic effects of HTLV type 1 Tax protein on cellular metabolism: mitotic checkpoint abrogation and NF-kappaB activation.,"Tax protein expressed by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a strong trans-activator of its own LTR promoter; it also affects the function of multiple cellular genes involved in cell cycle control and transcription. One way in which Tax exerts its pleiotropic effects is through protein-protein interaction with cellular cofactors. By using yeast two-hybrid technology, we have isolated several cellular proteins that bind to Tax. Two of these are MAD1, a mitotic checkpoint control protein, and TXBP151, a suppressor of tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis. Here we discuss findings describing the role of MAD1 in exit of cells from mitosis and TXBP151 in NF-kappaB activation."

19007958,Inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta signaling by two discrete peptides within measles virus V protein that specifically bind STAT1 and STAT2.,"The V protein of measles virus (MV-V) is a potent inhibitor of IFN-alpha/beta signaling pathway. We previously reported that when physically dissociated, the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of MV-V (PNT and VCT, respectively) could independently impair signal transduction. The PNT region inhibited IFN-alpha/beta signaling by interacting with at least two components of this pathway: Jak1 and STAT1. Here we report a direct interaction between the VCT of MV-V and STAT2, a third component of IFN-alpha/beta transduction machinery. This interaction with STAT2 is carried by the cysteine-constrained peptide of 49 amino acids localized in the VCT region, and is essential to the inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta signaling. In parallel, we also mapped STAT1 binding site in the PNT region and identified a minimal peptide of only 11 amino acids. IFN-alpha/beta signaling was impaired in human cells treated with this MV-V peptide fused to a cell-penetrating sequence. Finally, we show that signaling downstream of IFN-lambda, a recently identified cytokine that also relies on STAT1, STAT2 and Jak1 to transduce, is blocked by MV-V. Altogether, our results illustrate how a single viral protein has evolved to achieve a robust inhibition of the antiviral response by interacting with several signaling molecules."
10612665,Epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen-1 binds to nuclear transporter karyopherin alpha1/NPI-1 in addition to karyopherin alpha2/Rch1.,"We searched for cellular proteins that interact with Epstein-Barr (EBV) virus nuclear antigen-1, which is a latent EBV origin-binding protein detected in all EBV latently infected cells and essential for maintenance of the latent EBV genome, by a yeast two-hybrid screening of a B lymphocyte cDNA library in this study. Interaction of polypeptides synthesized from three selected cDNA clones with EBNA-1 proteins was confirmed in vitro using their glutathione-S-transferase-fusion polypeptides and by coimmunoprecipitation analyses of B cell extracts with anti-EBNA-1 monoclonal antibodies and monospecific antibodies against cellular proteins of interest. We report the following: (i) Karyopherin alpha (karyopherin alpha1, hSRP1, and NPI-1), an adaptor subunit of nuclear localization signal receptors, which direct proteins to the nuclear pore, interacted with EBNA-1. (ii) EBNA-1 proteins endogenous in the B cell line Raji of Burkitt lymphoma origin bound to another adaptor protein, karyopherin alpha2 (hSRP1alpha, hRch1), interactions of which to recombinant EBNA-1 polypeptides were previously reported. (iii) Nearly 90% of all the cDNA clones examined was p32 (SF2-associated P32, p32/TAP, and gC1q-R), and endogenous EBNA-1 proteins in the Raji cells bound to p32, a potential of which to affect localization of EBNA-1 in transfected Vero cells has been recently suggested. These results suggest that EBNA-1, which has the unique NLS containing Lys-Arg and overlapping with one of the phosphorylation domains, is recognized and transported to the nuclei by these two distinct karyopherin alpha proteins, which are differentially expressed in different cell types, implying a regulatory localization system for EBNA-1."
8957073,Inactivation of the cdk inhibitor p27KIP1 by the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein.,"Expression of the E7 oncogene of HPV-16 induces S phase entry of mammalian cells in the presence of antiproliferative signals. In particular, E7 can bypass G0/G1 arrest in response to both serum withdrawal and loss of cell adhesion, two experimental conditions in which cell cycle progression is accompanied by elevated levels of the cdk inhibitor p27KIP1. We show here that E7 can antagonize the ability of p27KIP1 to block cyclin E-associated kinase in vitro and to inhibit transcription from the cyclin A gene in transfection experiments. E7 associates with p27KIP1 both in a reconstituted in vitro system and in extracts of mammalian cells, and association requires the C-terminal part of E7. The interaction between p27KIP1 and E7 can also be demonstrated in a yeast two hybrid system. The data suggest that the ability of E7 to override certain forms of G0/G1 arrest is mediated in part by binding to and subsequent inactivation of the cdk inhibitor p27KIP1."
22046132,The SARS-coronavirus-host interactome: identification of cyclophilins as target for pan-coronavirus inhibitors.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human and animal pathogens that induce fatal respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological disease. The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to (Coronavirus) CoV epidemics. Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human and animal CoVs. Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets. In this study, we used a systems biology approach employing a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid interaction screen to identify immunopilins (PPIA, PPIB, PPIH, PPIG, FKBP1A, FKBP1B) as interaction partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1). These molecules modulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation. Overexpression of NSP1 and infection with live SARS-CoV strongly increased signalling through the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway and enhanced the induction of interleukin 2, compatible with late-stage immunopathogenicity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in severe SARS cases. Conversely, inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of CoVs of all genera, including SARS-CoV, human CoV-229E and -NL-63, feline CoV, as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus. Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CspA might serve as broad-range CoV inhibitors applicable against emerging CoVs as well as ubiquitous pathogens of humans and livestock."
15527853,SUMO-1 modification regulates the protein stability of the large regulatory protein Rep78 of adeno associated virus type 2 (AAV-2).,"The large Rep proteins Rep78 and Rep68 of the helper-dependent adeno associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) are essential for both site-specific integration of AAV DNA in the absence of helpervirus and productive AAV replication in the presence of helpervirus. We have identified UBC9, the E2 conjugating enzyme for the small ubiquitin-related polypeptide SUMO-1, as binding partner of the large Rep proteins in yeast two-hybrid analysis and in GST pulldown assays. Modification of the large Rep proteins with SUMO-1 could be demonstrated in immunoblot analysis and in immunoprecipitations, with the lysine residue at amino acid position 84 serving as the major attachment site. The largely sumolation-deficient Rep78 lysine to arginine point mutant showed a strongly reduced half-life as compared to the wild-type protein. This finding implicates a role for sumolation in the regulation of Rep78 protein stability that is assumed to be critical for the establishment and maintenance of AAV latency."
15140960,"Nipah virus V and W proteins have a common STAT1-binding domain yet inhibit STAT1 activation from the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, respectively.","In previous reports it was demonstrated that the Nipah virus V and W proteins have interferon (IFN) antagonist activity due to their ability to block signaling from the IFN-alpha/beta receptor (J. J. Rodriguez, J. P. Parisien, and C. M. Horvath, J. Virol. 76:11476-11483, 2002; M. S. Park et al., J. Virol. 77:1501-1511, 2003). The V, W, and P proteins are all encoded by the same viral gene and share an identical 407-amino-acid N-terminal region but have distinct C-terminal sequences. We now show that the P protein also has anti-IFN function, confirming that the common N-terminal domain is responsible for the antagonist activity. Truncation of this N-terminal domain revealed that amino acids 50 to 150 retain the ability to block IFN and to bind STAT1, a key component of the IFN signaling pathway. Subcellular localization studies demonstrate that the V and P proteins are predominantly cytoplasmic whereas the W protein is localized to the nucleus. In all cases, STAT1 colocalizes with the corresponding Nipah virus protein. These interactions are sufficient to inhibit STAT1 activation, as demonstrated by the lack of STAT1 phosphorylation on tyrosine 701 in IFN-stimulated cells expressing P, V, or W. Therefore, despite their common STAT1-binding domain, the Nipah virus V and P proteins act by retaining STAT1 in the cytoplasm while the W protein sequesters STAT1 in the nucleus, creating both a cytoplasmic and a nuclear block for STAT1. We also show that the IFN antagonist activity of the P protein is not as strong as that of V or W, perhaps explaining why Nipah virus has evolved to express these two edited products."
11854491,"The human DnaJ protein, hTid-1, enhances binding of a multimer of the herpes simplex virus type 1 UL9 protein to oris, an origin of viral DNA replication.","We have identified cellular proteins that interact with the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) origin-binding protein (UL9 protein) by screening a HeLa cell complementary DNA library by using the yeast two-hybrid system. Approximately 7 x 10(5) colonies were screened. Five of the 48 positive clones contained cDNAs that encoded the p150(Glued) component of the dynactin complex, three contained cDNAs for the neural F Box 42-kDa protein (NFB42), which is highly enriched in neural tissue, and three contained hTid-1, a human homologue of the bacterial DnaJ protein. We have focused in this report on the interaction of the viral UL9 protein with the cellular hTid-1. In vitro immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that hTid-1 interacts with the UL9 protein. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays indicated that the hTid-1 enhances the binding of UL9 protein to an HSV-1 origin, ori(s), and facilitates formation of the multimer from the dimeric UL9 protein. hTid-1 had no effect on the DNA-dependent ATPase or helicase activities associated with the UL9 protein. These findings implicate hTid-1 in HSV-1 DNA replication, and suggest that this cellular protein may provide a chaperone function analogous to the DnaJ protein in Escherichia coli DNA replication."
10559275,Cell surface CD4 inhibits HIV-1 particle release by interfering with Vpu activity.,"One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) infection is the rapid removal of the viral receptor CD4 from the cell surface. This remarkably efficient receptor interference requires the activity of three separate viral proteins: Env, Vpu, and Nef. We have investigated whether this unusually tight interference on cell surface CD4 expression had a more essential function during the viral life cycle than simply preventing superinfection. We now report that the removal of cell surface CD4 is required for optimal virus production by HIV-1. Indeed, maintenance of CD4 surface expression in infected cells lead to a 3-5-fold decrease in viral particle production. This effect was not due to the formation of intracellular complexes between CD4 and the gp160 viral envelope precursor but instead required the presence of CD4 at the cell surface and was specifically mediated by CD4 but not closely related plasma membrane receptors. The finding that CD4 had no significant effect on particle release by a Vpu-deficient variant indicates that CD4 acts by inhibiting the particle release-promoting activity of Vpu. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further showed that CD4 and Vpu physically interact at the cell surface, suggesting that CD4 might inhibit Vpu activity by disrupting its oligomeric structure."
19010780,Control of TANK-binding kinase 1-mediated signaling by the gamma(1)34.5 protein of herpes simplex virus 1.,"TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a key component of Toll-like receptor-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. In response to microbial components, TBK1 activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and cytokine expression. Here we show that TBK1 is a novel target of the gamma(1)34.5 protein, a virulence factor whose expression is regulated in a temporal fashion. Remarkably, the gamma(1)34.5 protein is required to inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and the induction of antiviral genes in infected cells. When expressed in mammalian cells, the gamma(1)34.5 protein forms complexes with TBK1 and disrupts the interaction of TBK1 and IRF3, which prevents the induction of interferon and interferon-stimulated gene promoters. Down-regulation of TBK1 requires the amino-terminal domain. In addition, unlike wild type virus, a herpes simplex virus mutant lacking gamma(1)34.5 replicates efficiently in TBK1(-/-) cells but not in TBK1(+/+) cells. Addition of exogenous interferon restores the antiviral activity in both TBK1(-/-) and TBK(+/+) cells. Hence, control of TBK1-mediated cell signaling by the gamma(1)34.5 protein contributes to herpes simplex virus infection. These results reveal that TBK1 plays a pivotal role in limiting replication of a DNA virus."
17121807,Involvement of Hsp90 in assembly and nuclear import of influenza virus RNA polymerase subunits.,"Transcription and replication of the influenza virus RNA genome occur in the nuclei of infected cells through the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase consisting of PB1, PB2, and PA. We previously identified a host factor designated RAF-1 (RNA polymerase activating factor 1) that stimulates viral RNA synthesis. RAF-1 is found to be identical to Hsp90. Here, we examined the intracellular localization of Hsp90 and viral RNA polymerase subunits and their molecular interaction. Hsp90 was found to interact with PB2 and PB1, and it was relocalized to the nucleus upon viral infection. We found that the nuclear transport of Hsp90 occurs in cells expressing PB2 alone. The nuclear transport of Hsp90 was in parallel with that of the viral RNA polymerase binary complexes, either PB1 and PB2 or PB1 and PA, as well as with that of PB2 alone. Hsp90 also interacted with the binary RNA polymerase complex PB1-PB2, and it was dissociated from the PB1-PB2 complex upon its association with PA. Furthermore, Hsp90 could form a stable PB1-PB2-Hsp90 complex prior to the formation of a ternary polymerase complex by the assembly of PA in the infected cells. These results suggest that Hsp90 is involved in the assembly and nuclear transport of viral RNA polymerase subunits, possibly as a molecular chaperone for the polymerase subunits prior to the formation of a mature ternary polymerase complex."
15563593,"The V proteins of paramyxoviruses bind the IFN-inducible RNA helicase, mda-5, and inhibit its activation of the IFN-beta promoter.","Most paramyxoviruses circumvent the IFN response by blocking IFN signaling and limiting the production of IFN by virus-infected cells. Here we report that the highly conserved cysteine-rich C-terminal domain of the V proteins of a wide variety of paramyxoviruses binds melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (mda-5) product. mda-5 is an IFN-inducible host cell DExD/H box helicase that contains a caspase recruitment domain at its N terminus. Overexpression of mda-5 stimulated the basal activity of the IFN-beta promoter in reporter gene assays and significantly enhanced the activation of the IFN-beta promoter by intracellular dsRNA. Both these activities were repressed by coexpression of the V proteins of simian virus 5, human parainfluenza virus 2, mumps virus, Sendai virus, and Hendra virus. Similar results to the reporter assays were obtained by measuring IFN production. Inhibition of mda-5 by RNA interference or by dominant interfering forms of mda-5 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-beta promoter by dsRNA. It thus appears that mda-5 plays a central role in an intracellular signal transduction pathway that can lead to the activation of the IFN-beta promoter, and that the V proteins of paramyxoviruses interact with mda-5 to block its activity."
17267598,Influenza virus targets the mRNA export machinery and the nuclear pore complex.,"The NS1 protein of influenza A virus is a major virulence factor that is essential for pathogenesis. NS1 functions to impair innate and adaptive immunity by inhibiting host signal transduction and gene expression, but its mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. We show here that NS1 forms an inhibitory complex with NXF1/TAP, p15/NXT, Rae1/mrnp41, and E1B-AP5, which are key constituents of the mRNA export machinery that interact with both mRNAs and nucleoporins to direct mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex. Increased levels of NXF1, p15, or Rae1 revert the mRNA export blockage induced by NS1. Furthermore, influenza virus down-regulates Nup98, a nucleoporin that is a docking site for mRNA export factors. Reduced expression of these mRNA export factors renders cells highly permissive to influenza virus replication, demonstrating that proper levels of key constituents of the mRNA export machinery protect against influenza virus replication. Because Nup98 and Rae1 are induced by interferons, down-regulation of this pathway is likely a viral strategy to promote viral replication. These findings demonstrate previously undescribed influenza-mediated viral-host interactions and provide insights into potential molecular therapies that may interfere with influenza infection."
15215253,"Poxvirus protein N1L targets the I-kappaB kinase complex, inhibits signaling to NF-kappaB by the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of receptors, and inhibits NF-kappaB and IRF3 signaling by toll-like receptors.","Poxviruses encode proteins that suppress host immune responses, including secreted decoy receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and the vaccinia virus proteins A46R and A52R that inhibit intracellular signaling by members of the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. In vivo, the TLRs mediate the innate immune response by serving as pathogen recognition receptors, whose oligomerized intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains can initiate innate immune signaling. A family of TIR domain-containing adapter molecules transduces signals from engaged receptors that ultimately activate NF-kappaB and/or interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Data base searches detected a significant similarity between the N1L protein of vaccinia virus and A52R, a poxvirus inhibitor of TIR signaling. Compared with other poxvirus virulence factors, the poxvirus N1L protein strongly affects virulence in vivo; however, the precise target of N1L was previously unknown. Here we show that N1L suppresses NF-kappaB activation following engagement of Toll/IL-1 receptors, tumor necrosis factor receptors, and lymphotoxin receptors. N1L inhibited receptor-, adapter-, TRAF-, and IKK-alpha and IKK-beta-dependent signaling to NF-kappaB. N1L associated with several components of the multisubunit I-kappaB kinase complex, most strongly associating with the kinase, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Together these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that N1L disrupts signaling to NF-kappaB by Toll/IL-1Rs and TNF superfamily receptors by targeting the IKK complex for inhibition. Furthermore, N1L inhibited IRF3 signaling, which is also regulated by TBK1. These studies define a role for N1L as an immunomodulator of innate immunity by targeting components of NF-kappaB and IRF3 signaling pathways."
15152192,"A second human antiretroviral factor, APOBEC3F, is suppressed by the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Vif proteins.","The HIV-1 Vif protein suppresses the inhibition of viral replication caused by the human antiretroviral factor APOBEC3G. As a result, HIV-1 mutants that do not express the Vif protein are replication incompetent in 'nonpermissive' cells, such as primary T cells and the T-cell line CEM, that express APOBEC3G. In contrast, Vif-defective HIV-1 replicates effectively in 'permissive' cell lines, such as a derivative of CEM termed CEM-SS, that do not express APOBEC3G. Here, we show that a second human protein, APOBEC3F, is also specifically packaged into HIV-1 virions and inhibits their infectivity. APOBEC3F binds the HIV-1 Vif protein specifically and Vif suppresses both the inhibition of virus infectivity caused by APOBEC3F and virion incorporation of APOBEC3F. Surprisingly, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G are extensively coexpressed in nonpermissive human cells, including primary lymphocytes and the cell line CEM, where they form heterodimers. In contrast, both genes are quiescent in the permissive CEM derivative CEM-SS. Together, these data argue that HIV-1 Vif has evolved to suppress at least two distinct but related human antiretroviral DNA-editing enzymes."
17977970,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vif functionally interacts with diverse APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases and moves with them between cytoplasmic sites of mRNA metabolism.,"Vif(IIIB), which has been a standard model for the viral infectivity factor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), binds the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G) and induces its degradation, thereby precluding its lethal incorporation into assembling virions. Additionally, Vif(IIIB) less efficiently degrades A3F, another potent anti-HIV-1 cytidine deaminase. Although the APOBEC3 paralogs A3A, A3B, and A3C have weaker anti-HIV-1 activities and are only partially degraded by Vif(IIIB), we found that Vif(IIIB) induces their emigration from the nucleus to the cytosol and thereby causes net increases in the cytosolic concentrations and anti-HIV-1 activities of A3A and A3B. In contrast, some other Vifs, exemplified by Vif(HXB2) and Vif(ELI-1), much more efficiently degrade and thereby neutralize all APOBEC3s. Studies focused mainly on A3F imply that it occurs associated with mRNA-PABP1 in translationally active polysomes and to a lesser extent in mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies). A3F appears to stabilize the P-bodies with which it is associated. A correspondingly small proportion of Vif(IIIB) also localizes in P-bodies in an A3F-dependent manner. Stress causes A3A, A3B, A3C, and A3F to colocalize efficiently with Vif(IIIB) and mRNA-PABP1 complexes in stress granules in a manner that is prevented by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of translational elongation. Coimmunoprecipitation studies suggest that Vifs from different HIV-1 isolates associate with all tested APOBEC3s. Thus, Vifs interact closely with structurally diverse APOBEC3s, with effects on their subcellular localization, degradation rates, and antiviral activities. Cytosolic APOBEC3-Vif complexes are predominantly bound to mRNAs that dynamically move between translationally active and storage or processing pools."
16339411,Herpesviral protein networks and their interaction with the human proteome.,"The comprehensive yeast two-hybrid analysis of intraviral protein interactions in two members of the herpesvirus family, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), revealed 123 and 173 interactions, respectively. Viral protein interaction networks resemble single, highly coupled modules, whereas cellular networks are organized in separate functional submodules. Predicted and experimentally verified interactions between KSHV and human proteins were used to connect the viral interactome into a prototypical human interactome and to simulate infection. The analysis of the combined system showed that the viral network adopts cellular network features and that protein networks of herpesviruses and possibly other intracellular pathogens have distinguishing topologies."
9482110,The C-terminus of the HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein mediates interaction with the PDZ domain of cellular proteins.,"Infection by HTLV-1 has been correlated with the appearance of various proliferative or degenerative diseases. Some of these disorders have been observed in transgenic mice expressing the Tax protein, which is known to transactivate various viral and cellular promoters through interactions with several transcription factors. In this study we show that the C-terminus of this viral oncoprotein represents a motif permitting binding of Tax to the PDZ domains of several cellular proteins. A two-hybrid screen with Tax as bait indeed yielded complementary DNAs coding for six proteins including PDZ domains. Two of them correspond to truncated forms of the PSD-95 and beta1-syntrophin proteins, another clone codes for a protein homologous to the product of the C. elegans gene lin-7. The other three clones code for new human members of the PDZ family of cellular proteins. The interaction of Tax with the products of these clones was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells, and analysis of various mutants of Tax established the importance of the C-terminal amino acids for several of these interactions. These data suggest that Tax could perturb the normal function of targeted cellular proteins by strongly interacting with their PDZ domains."
15229220,Post-translational modification of Rta of Epstein-Barr virus by SUMO-1.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses an immediate-early protein, Rta, to activate the transcription of EBV lytic genes and the lytic cycle. This work identifies Ubc9 and PIAS1 as binding partners of Rta in a yeast two-hybrid screen. These bindings are verified by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy. The interactions appear to cause Rta sumoylation, because not only can Rta be sumoylated in vitro but also sumoylated Rta can be detected in P3HR1 cells following lytic induction and in 293T cells after transfecting plasmids that express Rta and SUMO-1. Moreover, PIAS1 stimulates conjugation of SUMO-1 to Rta, thus acting as an E3 ligase. Furthermore, transfecting plasmids that express Ubc9, PIAS1, and SUMO-1 increases the capacity of Rta to transactivate the promoter that includes an Rta response element, indicating that the modification by SUMO-1 increases the transactivation activity of Rta. This study reveals that Rta is sumoylated at the Lys-19, Lys-213, and Lys-517 residues and that SUMO-1 conjugation at the Lys-19 residue is crucial for enhancing the transactivation activity of Rta. These results indicate that sumoylation of Rta may be important in EBV lytic activation."
9614873,The adeno-associated virus Rep78 major regulatory protein binds the cellular TATA-binding protein in vitro and in vivo.,"Rep78 is the major regulatory protein of adenoassociated virus (AAV). Rep78 is able to transcriptionally regulate all three of AAV's promoters, as well as a variety of heterologous promoters. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of action by which Rep78 is able to regulate gene expression, we are investigating Rep78's possible protein-protein interaction with basal transcription factors. One such critical basal transcription factor is the human TATA binding protein, TBP. TBP is a core factor required for the assemblage of the transcription initiation complex, TFIID. In this report an in vitro interaction between Rep78 and TBP was demonstrated in three different assay systems, including West(far)-Western analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay-supershift, and coimmunoprecipitation. Furthermore, using the yeast GAL4 two-hybrid system, an in vivo interaction between Rep78 and TBP was also demonstrated. Further still, the amino half of Rep78 is shown to be needed for Rep78-TBP interaction. Mutations within this region of Rep78 are known to be defective for transcriptional regulatory ability, suggesting a biological role for this interaction. Thus, Rep78 may regulate transcription through binding and regulating TBP's numerous interactions. Furthermore, as Rep78 is known to bind at least one other transcription factor (Sp 1) and likely others, Rep78 may function as a TBP-associated factor in an altered TFIID-like complex."
8912872,The adeno-associated virus Rep78 major regulatory/transformation suppressor protein binds cellular Sp1 in vitro and evidence of a biological effect.,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep78 is a multifunctional protein that is required for AAV transcriptional activity, AAV DNA replication, and possibly for site-specific integration of AAV into human chromosome 19. Rep78 is also able to inhibit a variety of heterologous promoters, including those of c-H-ras, human papillomavirus types 16 and 18, and HIV type 1. However, Rep78 is unable to significantly affect murine osteosarcomavirus (MSV). It was noticed that promoters that are inhibited possess binding motifs for the cellular transcription factor Sp1, whereas the MSV long terminal repeat promoter did not. These data stimulated the hypothesis that Rep78 may recognize and interact with cellular Sp1. Here, we demonstrate that Rep78 is able to interact with Sp1 in vitro as analyzed by West(far)-Western, electrophoretic mobility shift assay-supershift, and coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Furthermore, in support of an in vivo biological effect from this interaction, Rep78 is demonstrated to inhibit a synthetic, Sp1-dependent promoter. Further still, the insertion of Sp1 DNA binding motifs into the Rep78-resistant MSV long terminal repeat results in a promoter that has increased sensitivity to inhibition by Rep78. Finally, it is demonstrated that the Sp1-Rep78 interaction requires the amino half of Rep78. The interaction of Rep78 with Sp1, along with possible downstream effects on the transcription initiation process of RNA polymerase II, may partially explain the rather broad-based antitumor abilities of AAV."
16537587,Acetylated Tat regulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 splicing through its interaction with the splicing regulator p32.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) potent transactivator Tat protein mediates pleiotropic effects on various cell functions. Posttranslational modification of Tat affects its activity during viral transcription. Tat binds to TAR and subsequently becomes acetylated on lysine residues by histone acetyltransferases. Novel protein-protein interaction domains on acetylated Tat are then established, which are necessary for both sustained transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 promoter and viral transcription elongation. In this study, we investigated the identity of proteins that preferentially bound acetylated Tat. Using a proteomic approach, we identified a number of proteins that preferentially bound AcTat, among which p32, a cofactor of splicing factor ASF/SF-2, was identified. We found that p32 was recruited to the HIV-1 genome, suggesting a mechanism by which acetylation of Tat may inhibit HIV-1 splicing needed for the production of full-length transcripts. Using Tat from different clades, harboring a different number of acetylation sites, as well as Tat mutated at lysine residues, we demonstrated that Tat acetylation affected splicing in vivo. Finally, using confocal microscopy, we found that p32 and Tat colocalize in vivo in HIV-1-infected cells."
8663223,The HIV nef protein associates with protein kinase C theta.,"Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Nef protein has been linked to both decreased cell surface expression of CD4 and an impairment of signal transduction. The recently reported association of Nef with an unidentified serine kinase provides a clue as to how Nef might exert its effects. Considering the key role of protein kinase C (PKC) in T cell activation, we investigated the possibility that Nef interacts with PKC. Our results, using two approaches for detecting interactions between Nef and PKC isozymes in Jurkat cells, show that Nef interacts preferentially with thetaPKC. The interaction of Nef and thetaPKC is independent of calcium, enhanced by phospholipid activators of PKC and not affected by a PKC pseudosubstrate peptide. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin stimulation of Jurkat cells expressing Nef fails to produce the usual translocation of thetaPKC from the cytosol to the particulate fraction; translocation of betaPKC and epsilonPKC was unaffected. Indeed, there appears to be a net loss of thetaPKC in Nef-expressing cells following stimulation. The loss of thetaPKC, which may be a result of inhibition of its binding to RACKs due to Nef binding, could contribute to the various impairments of T cell function associated with HIV infection and Nef expression."
11222720,Epstein-Barr virus BamHi-a rightward transcript-encoded RPMS protein interacts with the CBF1-associated corepressor CIR to negatively regulate the activity of EBNA2 and NotchIC.,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BamHI-A rightward transcripts (BARTs) are expressed in all EBV-associated tumors as well as in latently infected B cells in vivo and cultured B-cell lines. One of the BART family transcripts contains an open reading frame, RPMS1, that encodes a nuclear protein termed RPMS. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that BART transcripts with the splicing pattern that generates the RPMS1 open reading frame are commonly expressed in EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines and are also detected in Hodgkin's disease tissues. Experiments undertaken to determine the function of RPMS revealed that RPMS interacts with both CBF1 and components of the CBF1-associated corepressor complex. RPMS interaction with CBF1 was demonstrated in a glutathione S-transferase (GST) affinity assay and by the ability of RPMS to alter the intracellular localization of a mutant CBF1. A Gal4-RPMS fusion protein mediated transcriptional repression, suggesting an additional interaction between RPMS and corepressor proteins. GST affinity assays revealed interaction between RPMS and the corepressor Sin3A and CIR. The RPMS-CIR interaction was further substantiated in mammalian two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and colocalization experiments. RPMS has been shown to interfere with NotchIC and EBNA2 activation of CBF1-containing promoters in reporter assays. Consistent with this function, immunofluorescence assays performed on cotransfected cells showed that there was colocalization of RPMS with NotchIC and with EBNA2 in intranuclear punctate speckles. The effect of RPMS on NotchIC function was further examined in a muscle cell differentiation assay where RPMS was found to partially reverse NotchIC-mediated inhibition of differentiation. The mechanism of RPMS action was examined in cotransfection and mammalian two-hybrid assays. The results revealed that RPMS blocked relief of CBF1-mediated repression and interfered with SKIP-CIR interactions. We conclude that RPMS acts as a negative regulator of EBNA2 and Notch activity through its interactions with the CBF1-associated corepressor complex."
20573815,Identification of rep-associated factors in herpes simplex virus type 1-induced adeno-associated virus type 2 replication compartments.,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a human parvovirus that replicates only in cells coinfected with a helper virus, such as adenovirus or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). We previously showed that nine HSV-1 factors are able to support AAV rep gene expression and genome replication. To elucidate the strategy of AAV replication in the presence of HSV-1, we undertook a proteomic analysis of cellular and HSV-1 factors associated with Rep proteins and thus potentially recruited within AAV replication compartments (AAV RCs). This study resulted in the identification of approximately 60 cellular proteins, among which factors involved in DNA and RNA metabolism represented the largest functional categories. Validation analyses indicated that the cellular DNA replication enzymes RPA, RFC, and PCNA were recruited within HSV-1-induced AAV RCs. Polymerase delta was not identified but subsequently was shown to colocalize with Rep within AAV RCs even in the presence of the HSV-1 polymerase complex. In addition, we found that AAV replication is associated with the recruitment of components of the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex, Ku70 and -86, and the mismatch repair proteins MSH2, -3, and -6. Finally, several HSV-1 factors were also found to be associated with Rep, including UL12. We demonstrated for the first time that this protein plays a role during AAV replication by enhancing the resolution of AAV replicative forms and AAV particle production. Altogether, these analyses provide the basis to understand how AAV adapts its replication strategy to the nuclear environment induced by the helper virus."
10799781,The influenza A virus M1 protein interacts with the cellular receptor of activated C kinase (RACK) 1 and can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C.,"The M1 protein of influenza A virus has multiple regulatory functions during the infectious cycle, which include mediation of nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins, inhibition of viral transcription and a crucial role in virus assembly and budding. The only known modification of the M1 protein is by phosphorylation through yet-to-be-identified kinases. We postulated that at least some of the M1 functions are exerted or regulated through interactions with cellular components. In a screen for such cellular mediators, the protein receptor of the activated C-kinase (RACK 1) was identified by its interaction with the viral M1 protein in the yeast two hybrid system. The physical M1-RACK 1 interaction was confirmed in glutathione-S-transferase-based coprecipitation assays for the diverged M1 proteins of avian, swine and human influenza A virus strains. This conservation suggests that the M1-RACK 1 interaction is of general importance during influenza A virus infections. RACK 1 has previously been identified to specifically bind the activated form of protein kinase C (PKC) and is assumed to anchor the kinase at membranes in the vicinity of its substrates. Since the M1 protein becomes phosphorylated during influenza virus infection, we examined if PKC could catalyze the phosphate transfer. We demonstrate that virion-derived and recombinant M1 protein can indeed be efficiently phosphorylated by purified PKC. Moreover, in cell extracts, we detected M1 phosphorylation activity that was strongly reduced in the presence of the PKC-specific inhibitor compound GF109203X. These data suggest that PKC is the main M1-phosphorylating activity in the cell. Since both, the M1 protein and PKC have been shown to interact with RACK 1, we suggest that the M1-RACK 1 interaction is involved in M1 phosphorylation."
18032501,Hsp40 facilitates nuclear import of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 Vpx-mediated preintegration complex.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) Vpx is required for nuclear translocation of the viral preintegration complex (PIC) in quiescent cells. In order to decipher the mechanism of action of Vpx, a cDNA library was screened with the yeast two-hybrid assay, resulting in the identification of heat shock protein 40, Hsp40/DnaJB6, as a Vpx-interactive protein. Interaction with Vpx was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Overexpression of Hsp40/DnaJB6 enhanced Vpx nuclear import, whereas overexpression of a nuclear localization mutant of Hsp40/DnaJB6 (H31Q) or down-regulation of Hsp40/DnaJB6 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the nuclear import of Vpx. Hsp40/DnaJB6 competed with the Pr55(Gag) precursor protein for the binding of Vpx and incorporation into virus-like particles. Overexpression of Hsp40/DnaJB6 promoted viral PIC nuclear import, whereas siRNA down-regulation of Hsp40/DnaJB6 inhibited PIC nuclear import. These results demonstrate a role for Hsp40/DnaJB6 in the regulation of HIV-2 PIC nuclear transport."
10861636,Analysis of relative binding affinity of E7-pRB of human papillomavirus 16 clinical variants using the yeast two-hybrid system.,"A number of genotypes of the human papillomaviruses (HPV) are associated with malignancies of the uterine cervix. Sequencing work has revealed the existence of intratype HPV variants with minor differences in the nucleotide sequence. More recent data suggest the possibility that some of the variants may have different modes of clinical manifestation. In this study, sequences of the E6 and E7 oncogenes of 17 HPV16 isolates derived from PAP smear samples of Taiwanese patients were analyzed. A number of E6 and E7 novel variants were found. Particularly, a prevalent (64.7%) E6 polymorphic site A442C with an E113D amino acid substitution seems specific to Taiwanese patients. In E7, two novel but silent polymorphic sites G663A (41.2%) and T846C (88.2%) were also prevalent in the samples analyzed. The yeast two-hybrid system was adopted for rapid assessment of relative E7-pRb binding affinity in the variants. The relative binding affinities of the E7 proteins of different HPV types to pRB were in close agreement with previous biochemical data. A T663G/C24W polymorphic change in E7 correlated with a decrease in E7-pRb relative binding affinity the significance of which remains to be clarified. This semi-quantitative biochemical and genetic approach may be useful as a first step in the development of clinical protocols for the screening and identification of important HPV variants for clinical interpretation and for further functional analysis by transfection or other bioassays."
10936084,Selective inhibition of nuclear steroid receptor function by a protein from a human tumorigenic poxvirus.,"The poxvirus molluscum contagiosum (MC) has a worldwide distribution and its prevalence is on the rise. Here we report that the MCV MC013L protein inhibits glucocorticoid and vitamin D, but not retinoid or estrogen, nuclear receptor transactivation. A direct interaction of MC013L with glucocorticoid and vitamin D receptor is supported by yeast two-hybrid, GST pull-down, and far Western blot analyses. Glucocorticoids act as potent inhibitors of keratinocyte proliferation, while vitamin D and retinoids promote and block terminal differentiation, respectively. Therefore, MC013L may promote efficient virus replication by blocking the differentiation of infected keratinocytes. MC013L may be the first member of a new class of poxvirus proteins that directly modulate nuclear receptor-mediated transcription."
9747724,Transcription-positive cofactor 4 enhances rescue of adeno-associated virus genome from an infectious clone.,"While Rep proteins are required for adeno-associated virus (AAV) replication, little is known about cellular proteins that interact with Rep. We demonstrate here that transcription-positive cofactor 4 (PC4, p15) fused to Gal4-activating domain interacted with both AAV-2 and AAV-3 Rep proteins fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain, leading to reporter activation in the yeast two-hybrid system. In addition to its coactivating function, PC4 recently has been shown to be involved in replication of simian virus 40. To study a functional role for the PC4-Rep protein interaction, 293-31 cells were cotransfected with a PC4 expression plasmid and an infectious clone of AAV-3, followed by super-infection with helper adenovirus. A significantly increased number of AAV-3 genomes were rescued in PC4 transfected cells. Our results support a possible involvement of PC4 in AAV replication and may be used in efficient production of AAV vectors for gene therapy."
15286176,Human Dlg protein binds to the envelope glycoproteins of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 and regulates envelope mediated cell-cell fusion in T lymphocytes.,"Human homologue of the Drosophila Dlg tumor suppressor (hDlg) is a widely expressed scaffold protein implicated in the organization of multi-protein complexes at cell adhesion sites such as the neuronal synapse. hDlg contains three PDZ domains that mediate its binding to the consensus motifs present at the C-termini of various cell surface proteins, thus inducing their clustering and/or stabilization at the plasma membrane. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified hDlg as a cellular binding partner of a viral membrane integral protein, the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus that infects CD4+ T lymphocytes and is preferentially transmitted via direct contacts between infected and target cells, through a structure referred to as the virological synapse. Here, we demonstrate that hDlg interacts with a classical PDZ domain-binding motif present at the C-terminus of the cytoplasmic domain of HTLV-1 Env and conserved in the related HTLV-2 virus. We further document that, in HTLV-1 infected primary T cells, hDlg and Env are concentrated in restricted areas of the plasma membrane, enriched in molecules involved in T-cell contacts. The presence of Gag proteins responsible for viral assembly and budding in these areas indicated that they constitute platforms for viral assembly and transmission. Finally, a mutant virus unable to bind hDlg exhibited a decreased ability to trigger Env mediated cell fusion between T lymphocytes. We thus propose that hDlg stabilizes HTLV-1 envelope glycoproteins at the virological synapse formed between infected and target cells, hence assisting the cell-to-cell transmission of the virus."
9195957,"The hepatitis B virus X-associated protein, XAP3, is a protein kinase C-binding protein.","The hepatitis B virus X protein induces transcriptional activation of a wide variety of viral and cellular genes. In addition to its ability to interact directly with many nuclear transcription factors, several reports indicate that the X protein stimulates different cytoplasmic kinase signal cascades. Using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we have isolated a clone designated X-associated protein 3 (XAP3) that encodes a human homolog of the rat protein kinase C-binding protein. One of the activation domains of X (amino acids 90-122) is required for binding to XAP3, while the NH2-terminal part of XAP3 is necessary for binding to X. Both X and XAP3 bound specifically to the eta PKC isoenzyme synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Overexpression of XAP3 enhanced X transactivation activity. These results support earlier findings that one of the mechanisms of transactivation by X is through involvement with the cellular protein kinase C pathway."
8709224,"Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 2 (EBNA2) binds to a component of the human SNF-SWI complex, hSNF5/Ini1.","Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), one of the six viral nuclear proteins expressed in latently infected B lymphocytes, is essential to the immortalization of B cells by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBNA2 promotes transcriptional transactivation of viral and cellular genes by acting as an adapter molecule that binds to cellular sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, JK recombination signal-binding protein (RBP-JK), and PU.1 and engages multiple members of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex. In the present study, we show that EBNA2 also interacts with hSNF5/Ini1, the human homolog of the yeast transcription factor SNF5. Gel filtration fractionation of partially purified EBV-positive lymphocyte nuclear extracts shows that a fraction of EBNA2 coelutes with both hSNF5/Ini1 and BRG1, a human homolog of SWI/SNF2, in the high-molecular-mass region (1.5 to 2.0 MDa) of a Superose 6 chromatogram. An affinity-purified rabbit antibody directed against hSNF5/Ini1 coimmunoprecipitates EBNA2 from this high-molecular-mass nuclear protein fraction, demonstrating that EBNA2 and hSNF5/Ini1 interact in vivo. This interaction is restricted to a subpopulation of phosphorylated viral EBNA2. Deletion mutation analysis of EBNA2 shows that the proline-rich aminoterminal end and a domain within the divergent region of EBNA2 mediate EBNA2-hSNF5/Ini1 interaction. Since the SNF-SWI complex participates in gene regulation through the alteration of nucleosome configuration and may be a component of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, the EBNA2-hSNF5/Ini1 interaction supports the hypothesis that EBNA2 facilitates transcriptional transactivation by acting as a transcription adapter molecule. We postulate that EBNA2 engages the hSNF-SWI complex to generate an open chromatin conformation at the EBNA2-responsive target genes, thereby potentiating the function of the RBP-JK-EBNA2-polymerase II transcription complex."
10888643,The interaction of vpr with uracil DNA glycosylase modulates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 In vivo mutation rate.,"The Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) influences the in vivo mutation rate of the virus. Since Vpr interacts with a cellular protein implicated in the DNA repair process, uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG), we have explored the contribution of this interaction to the mutation rate of HIV-1. Single-amino-acid variants of Vpr were characterized for their differential UNG-binding properties and used to trans complement vpr null mutant HIV-1. A striking correlation was established between the abilities of Vpr to interact with UNG and to influence the HIV-1 mutation rate. We demonstrate that Vpr incorporation into virus particles is required to influence the in vivo mutation rate and to mediate virion packaging of the nuclear form of UNG. The recruitment of UNG into virions indicates a mechanism for how Vpr can influence reverse transcription accuracy. Our data suggest that distinct mechanisms evolved in primate and nonprimate lentiviruses to reconcile uracil misincorporation into lentiviral DNA."
8875624,Viral co-factors in liver cancer: lessons from hepatitis B virus.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a co-factor in some hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Chronic infection with HBV is a risk factor for tumor development, suggesting the accumulation of cellular genetic changes. HBV DNA is frequently found integrated at random sites in HCC, with chromosomal deletions and rearrangements being common at the sites of viral integration. Tumor suppressor gene p53 is frequently altered in HCC. Environmental carcinogens are factors in HCC development in certain geographic locations. HBV encodes a protein (X) known to transactivate viral and cellular genes; the X gene is often retained in HCC. To learn more about X gene function. We employed the yeast two-hybrid genetic system to seek X-interactive proteins. A cellular protein, designated XAP-1, was recovered that interacts specifically with the X protein. XAP-1 is the human homologue of the monkey UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB); the UV-DDB protein functions in DNA repair and is defective in some xeroderma pigmentosum group E patients. The interaction between XAP-1 and HBV X protein was confirmed by several independent methods. This suggests that cellular DNA repair processes may be affected by HBV and that the resulting genetic instability may contribute to hepatocellular carcinogenesis. A unifying model of the molecular basis of HBV involvement in HCC development is presented. Fundamental components of the model are chronic infection by HBV and viral effects on cellular DNA repair. This model has implications for the possible role of HCV infection in the induction of HCV-associated HCC."
9765402,"Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus Rev and human T-cell leukemia virus Rex function, but not Mason-Pfizer monkey virus constitutive transport element activity, by a mutant human nucleoporin targeted to Crm1.","The hypothesis that the cellular protein Crm1 mediates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev-dependent nuclear export posits that Crm1 can directly interact both with the Rev nuclear export signal (NES) and with cellular nucleoporins. Here, we demonstrate that Crm1 is indeed able to interact with active but not defective forms of the HIV-1 Rev NES and of NESs found in other retroviral nuclear export factors. In addition, we demonstrate that Crm1 can bind the Rev NES when Rev is assembled onto the Rev response element RNA target and that Crm1, like Rev, is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein. Crm1 also specifically binds the Rev NES in vitro, although this latter interaction is detectable only in the presence of added Ran . GTP. Overexpression of a truncated, defective form of the nucleoporin Nup214/CAN, termed DeltaCAN, that retains Crm1 binding ability resulted in the effective inhibition of HIV-1 Rev or human T-cell leukemia virus Rex-dependent gene expression. In contrast, DeltaCAN had no significant affect on Mason-Pfizer monkey virus constitutive transport element (MPMV CTE)-dependent nuclear RNA export or on the expression of RNAs dependent on the cellular mRNA export pathway. As a result, DeltaCAN specifically blocked late, but not early, HIV-1 gene expression in HIV-1-infected cells. These data strongly validate Crm1 as a cellular cofactor for HIV-1 Rev and demonstrate that the MPMV CTE nuclear RNA export pathway uses a distinct, Crm1-independent mechanism. In addition, these data identify a novel and highly potent inhibitor of leucine-rich NES-dependent nuclear export."
11119607,An Epstein-Barr virus protein interacts with Notch.,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BamHI A mRNAs were originally identified in cDNA libraries from nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where they are expressed at high levels. The RNAs are differentially spliced to form several open reading frames and also contain the BARF0 open reading frame at the 3' end. One cDNA, RK-BARF0, included a potential endoplasmic reticulum-targeting signal peptide sequence. The RK-BARF0 protein is shown here to interact with the Notch4 ligand binding domain, using yeast two-hybrid screening, coimmunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy. This interaction induces translocation of a portion of the full-length unprocessed Notch4 to the nucleus by using the Notch nuclear localization signal. These effects of RK-BARF0 on Notch intracellular location indicate that EBV possibly modulates Notch signaling. Unprocessed Notch4 was also detected in immunoprecipitated complexes from EBV-infected cells by using a rabbit antiserum raised against a BARF0-specific peptide. This finding provides additional evidence for expression of RK-BARF0 and its interaction with Notch during EBV infection. In EBV-infected, EBNA2-negative cells, RK-BARF0 induced the expression of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), and this induction was dependent on the RK-BARF0/Notch interaction domain. The activation of LMP1 expression by RK-BARF0 may be responsible for expression of LMP1 in EBV latent infections in the absence of EBNA2."
16641280,Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus E8 protein is essential for wart formation and provides new insights into viral pathogenesis.,"The cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) a and b subtypes display a conserved E8 open reading frame encoding a 50-amino-acid hydrophobic protein, with structural similarities to the E5 transmembrane oncoprotein of genital human PVs (HPVs). CRPV E8 has been reported to play a role in papilloma growth but not to be essential in papilloma formation. Here we report that the knockout of E8 start codon almost prevented wart induction upon biobalistic inoculation of viral DNA onto rabbit skin. The scarce warts induced showed very slow growth, despite sustained expression of E6 and E7 oncogenes. This points to an essential role of E8 in disturbing epidermal homeostasis. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that E8 interacted with the zinc transporter ZnT1, protocadherin 1 (PCDH1), and AHNAK/desmoyokin, three proteins as yet unrelated to viral pathogenesis or cell transformation. HPV16 E5 also interacted with these proteins in two-hybrid assay. CRPV E8 mainly localized to the Golgi apparatus and the early endosomes of transfected keratinocytes and colocalized with ZnT1, PCDH1, and AHNAK. We showed that ZnT1 and PCDH1 formed a complex and that E8 disrupted this complex. CRPV E8, like HPV16 E5, increased epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and both the EGF-dependent and the EGF-independent activity of activating protein-1 (AP-1). Competition experiments with a nonfunctional truncated ZnT1 protein showed that E8-ZnT1 interaction was required for AP-1 activation. Our data identify CRPV E8 as a key player in papilloma induction and unravel novel cellular targets for inducing the proliferation of keratinocytes."
22174682,IRGM is a common target of RNA viruses that subvert the autophagy network.,"Autophagy is a conserved degradative pathway used as a host defense mechanism against intracellular pathogens. However, several viruses can evade or subvert autophagy to insure their own replication. Nevertheless, the molecular details of viral interaction with autophagy remain largely unknown. We have determined the ability of 83 proteins of several families of RNA viruses (Paramyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Retroviridae and Togaviridae), to interact with 44 human autophagy-associated proteins using yeast two-hybrid and bioinformatic analysis. We found that the autophagy network is highly targeted by RNA viruses. Although central to autophagy, targeted proteins have also a high number of connections with proteins of other cellular functions. Interestingly, immunity-associated GTPase family M (IRGM), the most targeted protein, was found to interact with the autophagy-associated proteins ATG5, ATG10, MAP1CL3C and SH3GLB1. Strikingly, reduction of IRGM expression using small interfering RNA impairs both Measles virus (MeV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-induced autophagy and viral particle production. Moreover we found that the expression of IRGM-interacting MeV-C, HCV-NS3 or HIV-NEF proteins per se is sufficient to induce autophagy, through an IRGM dependent pathway. Our work reveals an unexpected role of IRGM in virus-induced autophagy and suggests that several different families of RNA viruses may use common strategies to manipulate autophagy to improve viral infectivity."
11525746,A natural variability in the proline-rich motif of Nef modulates HIV-1 replication in primary T cells.,"In the infected host, the Nef protein of HIV/SIV is required for high viral loads and thus disease progression. Recent evidence indicates that Nef enhances replication in the T cell compartment after the virus is transmitted from dendritic cells (DC). The underlying mechanism, however, is not clear. Here, we report that a natural variability in the proline-rich motif (R71T) profoundly modulated Nef-stimulated viral replication in primary T cells of immature dendritic cell/T cell cocultures. Whereas both Nef variants (R/T-Nef) downregulated CD4, only the isoform supporting viral replication (R-Nef) efficiently interacted with signaling molecules of the T cell receptor (TCR) environment and stimulated cellular activation. Structural analysis suggested that the R to T conversion induces conformational changes, altering the flexibility of the loop containing the PxxP motif and hence its ability to bind cellular partners. Our report suggests that functionally and conformationally distinct Nef isoforms modulate HIV replication on the interaction level with the TCR-signaling environment once the virus enters the T cell compartment."
11231635,Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein EBNA-3C interacts with the human metastatic suppressor Nm23-H1: a molecular link to cancer metastasis.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus associated with a number of human malignancies including Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lymphoproliferative disease and, though still debated, breast carcinoma. A subset of latent EBV antigens is required for mediating immortalization of primary B-lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal region of the essential latent antigen, EBNA-3C, interacts specifically with the human metastatic suppressor protein Nm23-H1. Moreover, EBNA-3C reverses the ability of Nm23-H1 to suppress the migration of Burkitt lymphoma cells and breast carcinoma cells. We propose that EBNA-3C contributes to EBV-associated human cancers by targeting and altering the role of the metastasis suppressor Nm23-H1."
11100124,Uptake of HIV-1 tat protein mediated by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein disrupts the neuronal metabolic balance of the receptor ligands.,"Neurological disorders develop in most people infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we report that binding of HIV-1 transactivator (Tat) protein to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) promoted efficient uptake of Tat into neurons. LRP-mediated uptake of Tat was followed by translocation to the neuronal nucleus. Furthermore, the binding of Tat to LRP resulted in substantial inhibition of neuronal binding, uptake and degradation of physiological ligands for LRP, including alpha2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein E4, amyloid precursor protein and amyloid beta-protein. In a model of macaques infected with a chimeric strain of simian-human immunodeficiency virus, increased staining of amyloid precursor protein was associated with Tat expression in the brains of simian-human immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques with encephalitis. These results indicate that HIV-1 Tat may mediate HIV-1-induced neuropathology through a pathway involving disruption of the metabolic balance of LRP ligands and direct activation of neuronal genes."
18971280,Identification of cellular proteins that interact with the adeno-associated virus rep protein.,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) codes for four related nonstructural Rep proteins. AAV both replicates and assembles in the nucleus and requires coinfection with a helper virus, either adenovirus (Ad) or herpesvirus, for a productive infection. Like other more complex DNA viruses, it is believed that AAV interacts or modifies host cell proteins to carry out its infection cycle. To date, relatively little is known about the host proteins that interact with the viral Rep proteins, which are known to be directly involved in DNA replication, control of viral and cellular transcription, splicing, and protein translation. In this study, we used affinity-tagged Rep protein to purify cellular protein complexes that were associated with Rep in cells that had been infected with Ad and AAV. In all, we identified 188 cellular proteins from 16 functional categories, including 14 transcription factors, 6 translation factors, 15 potential splicing proteins, 5 proteins involved in protein degradation, and 13 proteins involved in DNA replication or repair. This dramatically increases the number of potential interactions over the current number of approximately 26. Twelve of the novel proteins found were further tested by coimmunoprecipitation or colocalization using confocal immunomicroscopy. Of these, 10 were confirmed as proteins that formed complexes with Rep, including proteins of the MCM complex (DNA replication), RCN1 (membrane transport), SMC2 (chromatin dynamics), EDD1 (ubiquitin ligase), IRS4 (signal transduction), and FUS (splicing). Computer analysis suggested that 45 and 28 of the 188 proteins could be placed in a pathway of interacting proteins involved in DNA replication and protein synthesis, respectively. Of the proteins involved in DNA replication, all of the previously identified proteins involved in AAV DNA replication were found, except Ad DBP. The only Ad protein found to interact with Rep was the E1b55K protein. In addition, we confirmed that Rep interacts with Ku70/80 helicase. In vitro DNA synthesis assays demonstrated that although Ku helicase activity could substitute for MCM to promote strand displacement synthesis, its presence was not essential. Our study suggests that the interaction of AAV with cellular proteins is much more complex than previously suspected and provides a resource for further studies of the AAV life cycle."
12408826,Tat stimulates cotranscriptional capping of HIV mRNA.,"Here we investigated how capping and methylation of HIV pre-mRNAs are coupled to Pol II elongation. Stable binding of the capping enzyme (Mce1) and cap methyltransferase (Hcm1) to template-engaged Pol II depends on CTD phosphorylation, but not on nascent RNA. Both Mce1 and Hcm1 travel with Pol II during elongation. The capping and methylation reactions cannot occur until the nascent pre-mRNA has attained a chain length of 19-22 nucleotides. HIV pre-mRNAs are capped quantitatively when elongation complexes are halted at promoter-proximal positions, but capping is much less efficient during unimpeded Pol II elongation. Cotranscriptional capping of HIV mRNA is strongly stimulated by Tat, and this stimulation requires the C-terminal segment of Tat that mediates its direct binding to Mce1. Our findings implicate capping in an elongation checkpoint critical to HIV gene expression."
15113913,The papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein is ubiquitinated by UbcH7 and Cullin 1- and Skp2-containing E3 ligase.,"Recurrent infections with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with human cervical cancers. All HPV-associated cancer tissues express the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, which stimulate cell growth. The expression of E7 is crucial for both the initiation and the maintenance of HPV-associated cancer. Recent studies showed that the level of E7 in cancer cells is regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis through the 26S proteasome. In this study, we characterized the enzymes involved in the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of E7. We show that UbcH7, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is specifically involved in the ubiquitination of E7. Furthermore, we show that E7 interacts with the SCF (Skp-Cullin-F box) ubiquitin ligase complex containing Cullin 1 (Cul1) and Skp2 and can be ubiquitinated by the Cul1-containing ubiquitin ligase in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses revealed that E7 interacts with Skp2 and Cul1 in vivo. Finally, the half-life of E7 was found to be significantly longer in Skp2(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) than in wild-type MEFs. Taken together, these results suggest that the Cul1- and Skp2-containing ubiquitin ligase plays a role in the ubiquitination and proteolysis of E7. In HPV type 16-containing cervical carcinoma cell line Caski, E7 localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Brief treatment of Caski cells with MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor) causes the accumulation of E7 in discrete nuclear bodies. These nuclear bodies are detergent insoluble and contain polyubiquitinated E7. We suggest that E7 relocates to specific nuclear bodies for proteolysis in HPV-containing epithelial cells."
9781815,Biochemical and genetic evidence for complex formation between the influenza A virus NS1 protein and the interferon-induced PKR protein kinase.,"The interferon (IFN)-induced protein kinase (PKR) functions as a gatekeeper of mRNA translation initiation and is, therefore, a key mediator of the host IFN-induced antiviral defense system. Many viruses have invested countermeasures against PKR. Some apparently use more than one mechanism. The influenza virus can repress PKR activity through the use of at least two factors, the cellular P58IPK protein and the viral NS1 protein. The exact mode of action of the latter has not been established. Here, using a coprecipitation assay, we found that PKR could form a complex with NS1 in crude cell extracts prepared from influenza virus-infected HeLa cells. The NS1-PKR interaction was verified by using the yeast two-hybrid system and an in vitro binding assay. Deletion analysis mapped the NS1 binding site to the N-terminal 98 residues of PKR regulatory region. Furthermore, an NS1 mutant, which lacks PKR inhibitory activity, did not bind PKR. Finally, the functional role of NS1 in PKR inhibition was substantiated using an in vivo assay for PKR activity. These results support the role of NS1 in PKR modulation during viral infection that is mediated through a complex formation between the two proteins."
16501114,A hydrophobic binding surface on the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef core is critical for association with p21-activated kinase 2.,"The interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef with p21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2) has been proposed to play an important role in T-cell activation and disease progression during viral infection. However, the mechanism by which Nef activates Pak2 is poorly understood. Mutations in most Nef motifs previously reported to be required for Pak2 activation (G2, PxxP72, and RR105) also affect other Nef functions, such as CD4 or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) downregulation. To better understand Nef interactions with Pak2, we performed mutational analysis of three primary HIV-1 Nef clones that exhibited similar capacities for downregulation of CD4 and MHC-I but variable abilities to associate with activated Pak2. Our results demonstrate that Nef amino acids at positions 85, 89, 187, 188, and 191 (L, H, S, R, and F in the clade B consensus, respectively) are critical for Pak2 association. Mutation of these Nef residues dramatically altered association with Pak2 without affecting Nef expression levels or CD4 and MHC-I downregulation. Furthermore, compensation occurred at positions 89 and 191 when both amino acids were substituted. Since residues 85, 89, 187, 188, and 191 cluster on the surface of the Nef core domain in a region distinct from the dimerization and SH3-binding domains, we propose that these Nef residues form part of a unique binding surface specifically involved in association with Pak2. This binding surface includes exposed and recessed hydrophobic residues and may participate in an as-yet-unidentified protein-protein interaction to facilitate Pak2 activation."
16260749,"Direct interaction of the human I-mfa domain-containing protein, HIC, with HIV-1 Tat results in cytoplasmic sequestration and control of Tat activity.","The primary function of the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat, activation of transcription from the viral LTR, is highly regulated by complex interactions between Tat and a number of host cell proteins. Tat nuclear import, a process mediated by importin beta, is a prerequisite for its activity. Here, we report and characterize the interaction of the human inhibitor of MyoD family domain-containing protein (I-mfa), HIC, with Tat at a biochemical and a functional level. This interaction was shown to occur in vivo and in vitro and to involve the nuclear localization signal and the transactivation responsive element-binding domains of Tat and the I-mfa domain of HIC. Coexpression of HIC and Tat resulted in the down-regulation of transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR, and colocalization studies revealed the cytoplasmic sequestration of Tat by HIC. Functionally this sequestration appears to be the underlying mechanism of LTR transcriptional repression by HIC and represents a unique mechanism for the control of Tat activity and regulation of HIV-1 replication."
15194762,Nef proteins from simian immunodeficiency virus-infected chimpanzees interact with p21-activated kinase 2 and modulate cell surface expression of various human receptors.,"The accessory Nef protein allows human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to persist at high levels and to cause AIDS in infected humans. The function of HIV-1 group M subtype B nef alleles has been extensively studied, and a variety of in vitro activities believed to be important for viral pathogenesis have been established. However, the function of nef alleles derived from naturally simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected chimpanzees, the original host of HIV-1, or from the HIV-1 N and O groups resulting from independent zoonotic transmissions remains to be investigated. In the present study we demonstrate that SIVcpz and HIV-1 group N or O nef alleles down-modulate CD4, CD28, and class I or II MHC molecules and up-regulate surface expression of the invariant chain (Ii) associated with immature major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. Furthermore, the ability of Nef to interact with the p21-activated kinase 2 was generally conserved. The functional activity of HIV-1 group N and O nef genes did not differ significantly from group M nef alleles. However, SIVcpz nef genes as a group showed a 1.8- and 2.0-fold-higher activity in modulating CD28 (P = 0.0002) and Ii (P = 0.016) surface expression, respectively, but were 1.7-fold less active in down-regulating MHC class II molecules (P = 0.006) compared to HIV-1 M nef genes. Our finding that primary SIVcpz nef alleles derived from naturally infected chimpanzees modulate the surface expression of various human cellular receptors involved in T-cell activation and antigen presentation suggests that functional nef genes helped the chimpanzee virus to persist efficiently in infected humans immediately after zoonotic transmission."
16677157,A novel hepatitis B virus X-interactive protein: cytochrome C oxidase III.,"Hepatitis B virus-encoded X protein has been shown to be capable of activating many different viral and cellular promoters through protein-protein interactions and to contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. As its mechanism has not yet been identified unequivocally, the aim of the present study was to screen the cellular proteins that can interact with X protein."
10704345,The E7 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus type 16 interacts with F-actin in vitro and in vivo.,"We report here that E7 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) forms a complex in vivo and in vitro with actin, one of the components of the cellular cytoskeleton. The in vivo interaction was detected by immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopic examination of normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK) and CV-1 cells after transient expression of E7 employing the vaccinia virus-T7 RNA polymerase system and by coimmunoprecipitation from an immortalized, nontumorigenic cell line obtained after transfecting NHOK with the cloned HPV-16 DNA genome. The in vitro interaction was detected by cosedimentation of bacterially expressed E7 phosphorylated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate or purified casein kinase II (CKII) prior to incubation with F-actin. This interaction was inhibited if E7 phosphorylation by the rabbit reticulocyte lysate was prevented with heparin, a CKII inhibitor, or if the amino acids Ser-31 and Ser-32 in E7, which are phosphorylated by CKII, were replaced with amino acids that cannot be phosphorylated. Interestingly, a decrease in the amount of polymerized actin occurred in cells expressing E7."
18165234,Avian and 1918 Spanish influenza a virus NS1 proteins bind to Crk/CrkL Src homology 3 domains to activate host cell signaling.,"NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) is an important virulence factor of the influenza A virus. We observed that NS1 proteins of the 1918 pandemic virus (A/Brevig Mission/1/18) and many avian influenza A viruses contain a consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding motif. Screening of a comprehensive human SH3 phage library revealed the N-terminal SH3 of Crk and CrkL as the preferred binding partners. Studies with recombinant proteins confirmed avid binding of NS1 proteins of the 1918 virus and a representative avian H7N3 strain to Crk/CrkL SH3 but not to other SH3 domains tested, including p85alpha and p85beta. Endogenous CrkL readily co-precipitated NS1 from cells infected with the H7N3 virus. In transfected cells association with CrkL was observed for NS1 of the 1918 and H7N3 viruses but not A/Udorn/72 or A/WSN/33 NS1 lacking this sequence motif. SH3 binding was dispensable for suppression of interferon-induced gene expression by NS1 but was associated with enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, as evidenced by increased Akt phosphorylation. Thus, the Spanish Flu virus resembles avian influenza A viruses in its ability to recruit Crk/CrkL to modulate host cell signaling."
11827166,HIV-1 Rev transactivator: a beta-subunit directed substrate and effector of protein kinase CK2.,"The phosphorylation of HIV-1 Rev by protein kinase CK2 is strictly dependent on the regulatory beta subunit of the kinase and is deeply affected by conformational changes of the substrate outside the phosphorylation site. Here we show that Rev modulates a variety of CK2 properties, including autophosphorylation, catalytic activity toward calmodulin, and susceptibility to polycationic effectors, whose common denominator is the involvement of the beta subunit. Rev's two major CK2 sites are located at its N-terminus, immediately adjacent to a helix-loop-helix motif. By comparing the behaviour of full-size Rev with that of synthetic peptides reproducing, with suitable modifications, its N-terminal 26 amino acids including the phosphoacceptor site (Ser 5, Ser 8) and amphipathic helix-1, it appears that the functional interaction of the N-terminal portion of Rev with the N-terminal domain of the beta subunit must rely on both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The former mainly involve Rev's arginine-rich domain (residues 35-50) in helix-2, while the latter are mostly mediated by residues 12-24 of helix-1. These data disclose the possibility that, besides displaying protective, regulatory and targeting properties with respect to the catalytic subunit, the CK2 beta subunit also plays a role as a docking site for a subset of CK2 substrates."
15970589,The homeobox protein MSX2 interacts with tax oncoproteins and represses their transactivation activity.,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) tax is an essential gene involved in the transcriptional activation of viral expression. Tax is also believed to be implicated in leukemogenesis because of its ability to immortalize primary cells in vitro. To gain insight into the molecular pathways mediating the activities of this important gene, we identified cellular proteins interacting with Tax. By means of a two-hybrid approach, we show that Tax specifically interacts with MSX2, a general repressor of gene expression. GST pull-down experiments and co-immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed binding specificity. Furthermore, the N-terminal residues 1-79 of MSX2 are required for binding, whereas the C-terminal residues 201-267 of MSX2 do not play a critical role. Whereas the oncogenic potential of Tax in primary cells was only slightly affected by overexpression of MSX2, the other function of Tax, namely LTR-dependent transcriptional activation, was inhibited by MSX2 in human HeLa and bovine B-lymphoblastoid (BL3) cell lines. This MSX2 repression function can be counteracted by overexpression of transcription factors CREB2 and RAP74. The Tax/MSX2 interplay thus results in repression of viral transcriptional activation possibly acting as a regulatory feedback loop. Importantly, this viral gene silencing is not strictly associated with a concomitant loss of Tax oncogenicity as measured by its ability to immortalize primary cells. And interestingly, MSX2 also interacts with and inhibits the transactivation function of the related Tax1 protein encoded by the Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)."
16201484,[Screening and cloning of the genes of protein interacting with the N-terminal protein of hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase by yeast-two hybrid technique].,To screen and clone the genes of protein interacting with the N-terminal protein (TP) of hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase.
16518412,Biochemical and functional characterization of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded BARF1 protein: interaction with human hTid1 protein facilitates its maturation and secretion.,"EBV BARF1 gene encodes a secretory protein with transforming and mitogenic activities. In this report, the post-translational modification, folding, maturation and secretion of BARF1 are systematically studied by site-directed mutagenesis and overexpression of the protein in mammalian cells using the vaccinia/T7 system. The protein was shown to be post-translationally modified by N-linked glycosylation on the asparagine 95 residue. This modification was confirmed to be essential for the maturation and secretion of the protein. Analysis of the four cysteine residues by site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that cysteine 146 and 201 were essential for proper folding and secretion of the protein. To search for human proteins involved in the maturation process of the protein, a yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out using the BARF1 sequence from amino acids 21-221 (BARF1Delta) as bait, leading to the identification of human hTid1 protein as a potential interacting protein. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and dual immunofluorescent labeling of cells coexpressing BARF1 and hTid1, and the interaction domain in hTid1 was mapped to amino acids 149-320. Interestingly, coexpression of BARF1 with hTid1 demonstrated that hTid1 could promote secretion of BARF1, suggesting that hTid1 may act as a chaperone to facilitate the folding, processing and maturation of BARF1."
14517094,The adeno-associated virus major regulatory protein Rep78-c-Jun-DNA motif complex modulates AP-1 activity.,"Multiple epidemiologic studies show that adeno-associated virus (AAV) is negatively associated with cervical cancer (CX CA), a cancer which is positively associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Mechanisms for this correlation may be by Rep78's (AAV's major regulatory protein) ability to bind the HPV-16 p97 promoter DNA and inhibit transcription, to bind and interfere with the functions of the E7 oncoprotein of HPV-16, and to bind a variety of HPV-important cellular transcription factors such as Sp1 and TBP. c-Jun is another important cellular factor intimately linked to the HPV life cycle, as well as keratinocyte differentiation and skin development. Skin is the natural host tissue for both HPV and AAV. In this article it is demonstrated that Rep78 directly interacts with c-Jun, both in vitro and in vivo, as analyzed by Western blot, yeast two-hybrid cDNA, and electrophoretic mobility shift-supershift assay (EMSA supershift). Addition of anti-Rep78 antibodies inhibited the EMSA supershift. Investigating the biological implications of this interaction, Rep78 inhibited the c-Jun-dependent c-jun promoter in transient and stable chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) assays. Rep78 also inhibited c-Jun-augmented c-jun promoter as well as the HPV-16 p97 promoter activity (also c-Jun regulated) in in vitro transcription assays in T47D nuclear extracts. Finally, the Rep78-c-Jun interaction mapped to the amino-half of Rep78. The ability of Rep78 to interact with c-Jun and down-regulate AP-1-dependent transcription suggests one more mechanism by which AAV may modulate the HPV life cycle and the carcinogenesis process."
15383329,Identification and cloning of a novel chromatin-associated protein partner of Epstein-Barr nuclear protein 2.,"In a screen for binding partners of the Epstein-Barr virus transformation-related protein EBNA2, we cloned a novel, evolutionarily conserved protein showing similarity to the Drosophila Parallel Sister Chromatids Protein (PASC). We have named this protein ""Friend of EBNA2"" (FOE). Human FOE encodes a protein of 1227 amino acids with a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal, an arginine-rich motif, a putative nuclear export signal as well as with three highly acidic regions and a predicted coiled-coil domain. FOE and EBNA2 coimmunoprecipitate from lymphocyte nuclear extracts. RNA and protein blots show that FOE is expressed in all human tissues. FOE is a nuclear protein with the bulk of the protein associated with the insoluble nuclear fraction biochemically defined as the nuclear matrix. Indirect immunofluorescence and dynamic imaging studies suggest that FOE associates with transcriptionally active nuclear subregions in interphase cells and concentrates at the ends of formed chromosomes during mitosis."
15843383,Identification of FEZ1 as a protein that interacts with JC virus agnoprotein and microtubules: role of agnoprotein-induced dissociation of FEZ1 from microtubules in viral propagation.,"The human polyomavirus JC virus (JCV) is the causative agent of a fatal demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and encodes six major proteins, including agnoprotein. Agnoprotein colocalizes with microtubules in JCV-infected cells, but its function is not fully understood. We have now identified fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1 (FEZ1) as a protein that interacted with JCV agnoprotein in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library. An in vitro binding assay showed that agnoprotein interacted directly with FEZ1 and microtubules. A microtubule cosedimentation assay revealed that FEZ1 also associates with microtubules and that agnoprotein induces the dissociation of FEZ1 from microtubules. Agnoprotein inhibited the promotion by FEZ1 of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Conversely, overexpression of FEZ1 suppressed JCV protein expression and intracellular trafficking in JCV-infected cells. These results suggest that FEZ1 promotes neurite extension through its interaction with microtubules, and that agnoprotein facilitates JCV propagation by inducing the dissociation of FEZ1 from microtubules."
7634337,Identification of a novel cellular cofactor for the Rev/Rex class of retroviral regulatory proteins.,"HIV-1 Rev is the prototype of a class of retroviral regulatory proteins that induce the sequence-specific nuclear export of target RNAs. This function requires the Rev activation domain, which is believed to bind an essential cellular cofactor. We report the identification of a novel human gene product that binds to not only the HIV-1 Rev activation domain in vitro and in vivo but also to functionally equivalent domains in other Rev and Rex proteins. The Rev/Rex activation domain-binding (Rab) protein occupies a binding site on HIV-1 Rev that precisely matches that predicted by genetic analysis. Rab binds the Rev activation domain when Rev is assembled onto its RNA target and can significantly enhance Rev activity when overexpressed. We conclude that Rab is the predicted activation domain-specific cofactor for the Rev/Rex class of RNA export factors."
17686838,Measles virus N protein inhibits host translation by binding to eIF3-p40.,"The nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA genome of measles virus (MV) is encapsidated by the virus-encoded nucleocapsid protein (N). In this study, we searched for N-binding cellular proteins by using MV-N as bait and screening the human T-cell cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid assay and isolated the p40 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3-p40) as a binding partner. The interaction between MV-N and eIF3-p40 in mammalian cells was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. Since eIF3-p40 is a translation initiation factor, we analyzed the potential inhibitory effect of MV-N on protein synthesis. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused MV-N (GST-N) inhibited translation of reporter mRNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system in a dose-dependent manner. Encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site-mediated translation, which requires canonical initiation factors to initiate translation, was also inhibited by GST-N. In contrast, a unique form of translation mediated by the intergenic region of Plautia stali intestine virus, which can assemble 80S ribosomes in the absence of canonical initiation factors, was scarcely affected by GST-N. In vivo expression of MV-N induced by the Cre/loxP switching system inhibited the synthesis of a transfected reporter protein, as well as overall protein synthesis. These results suggest that MV-N targets eIF3-p40 and may be involved in inhibiting MV-induced host translation."
9151883,"Uracil DNA glycosylase specifically interacts with Vpr of both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus of sooty mangabeys, but binding does not correlate with cell cycle arrest.","The Vpr protein encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is important for growth of virus in macrophages and prevents infected cells from passing into mitosis (G2 arrest). The cellular target for these functions is not known, but Vpr of HIV-1 and the related Vpr from simian immunodeficiency virus of sooty mangabeys (SIV(SM)) bind the DNA repair enzyme UNG, while the Vpx protein of SIV(SM) does not. Nonetheless, a mutational analysis of Vpr showed that binding to UNG is neither necessary nor sufficient for the effect of Vpr on the cell cycle."
17049367,"mda-5, but not RIG-I, is a common target for paramyxovirus V proteins.","The induction of IFN-beta by the paramyxovirus PIV5 (formerly known as SV5) is limited by the action of the viral V protein that targets the cellular RNA helicase mda-5. Here we show that 12 other paramyxoviruses also target mda-5 by a direct interaction between the conserved cysteine-rich C-terminus of their V proteins and the helicase domain of mda-5. The inhibition of IFN-beta induction is not species-restricted, being observed in a range of mammalian cells as well as in avian cells, and we show that the inhibition of mda-5 function is also not restricted to mammalian cells. In contrast, the V proteins do not bind to the related RNA helicase RIG-I and do not inhibit its activity. The relative contributions of mda-5 and RIG-I to IFN-beta induction are discussed."
17192311,Nuclear import of bovine papillomavirus type 1 E1 protein is mediated by multiple alpha importins and is negatively regulated by phosphorylation near a nuclear localization signal.,"Papillomavirus DNA replication occurs in the nucleus of infected cells and requires the viral E1 protein, which enters the nuclei of host epithelial cells and carries out enzymatic functions required for the initiation of viral DNA replication. In this study, we investigated the pathway and regulation of the nuclear import of the E1 protein from bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1). Using an in vitro binding assay, we determined that the E1 protein interacted with importins alpha3, alpha4, and alpha5 via its nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence. In agreement with this result, purified E1 protein was effectively imported into the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells after incubation with importin alpha3, alpha4, or alpha5 and other necessary import factors. We also observed that in vitro binding of E1 protein to all three alpha importins was significantly decreased by the introduction of pseudophosphorylation mutations in the NLS region. Consistent with the binding defect, pseudophosphorylated E1 protein failed to enter the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells in vitro. Likewise, the pseudophosphorylation mutant showed aberrant intracellular localization in vivo and accumulated primarily on the nuclear envelope in transfected HeLa cells, while the corresponding alanine replacement mutant displayed the same cellular location pattern as wild-type E1 protein. Collectively, our data demonstrate that BPV1 E1 protein can be transported into the nucleus by more than one importin alpha and suggest that E1 phosphorylation by host cell kinases plays a regulatory role in modulating E1 nucleocytoplasmic localization. This phosphoregulation of nuclear E1 protein uptake may contribute to the coordination of viral replication with keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation."
12351659,Molecular examination of the transmembrane requirements of the platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor for a productive interaction with the bovine papillomavirus E5 oncoprotein.,"The small transmembrane E5 protein of bovine papillomavirus (BPV) transforms cells by forming a stable complex with and activating the platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor (PDGFbetaR). The E5/PDGFbetaR interaction is thought to involve specific physical contacts between the transmembrane domains of the two proteins. Lys(499) at the extracellular juxtamembrane position and Thr(513) within the transmembrane domain of the PDGFbetaR are required for the interaction and are predicted to contact analogously positioned residues in the E5 protein. Here, mutagenic analysis of the transmembrane region of the PDGFbetaR was performed to further characterize the nature of the E5/PDGFbetaR interaction. We show that the receptor transmembrane domain, with minimal extracellular and intracellular sequence, is sufficient for the interaction. In addition, we provide evidence that the polar nature of Thr(513) as well as its positioning along the transmembrane alpha-helix is important for the interaction. We also identify the receptor transmembrane amino acids Ile(506) and Leu(520) as additional requirements for the interaction. Because Lys(499), Thr(513), Ile(506), and Leu(520) all align along the same face of the predicted PDGFbetaR transmembrane alpha-helix, our data support the model that the PDGFbetaR contacts the E5 protein via multiple amino acids along a single alpha-helical interface."
15674330,Interaction of HTLV-1 Tax and methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 positively regulates the gene expression from the hypermethylated LTR.,"Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is critical in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of normal epigenetic transcription occurs in abnormal physiological conditions, such as those seen in cancer cells and cells infected with parasites, making the mechanism underlying abnormal epigenetic transcription of great interest. Gene expression of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is regulated by a viral transcriptional stimulator, Tax. We herein report a novel mechanism of transcription from the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) that is regulated by Tax. In this study, we determined that Tax is able to activate transcription from the LTR, even when it was heavily methylated. In addition, the methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (MBD2) protein played an important role in Tax-mediated transcriptional activation. We demonstrated the importance of a physical interaction between Tax and MBD2 in enhancing the transcriptional activity of Tax against the methylated LTR. Furthermore, we identified the formation of a protein complex composed of MBD2 and Tax bound to the methylated LTR. We propose a new model of epigenetic regulation by MBD2 acting in concert with a virally encoded transactivator, Tax. Our observation provides insight into the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and the diverse mechanisms of transcriptional regulation using methylated promoters."
12181323,"Negative regulation of Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1-mediated functions by the bone morphogenetic protein receptor IA-binding protein, BRAM1.","The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus causes cellular transformation and activates several intracellular signals, including NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Using yeast two-hybrid screening with the LMP1 C-terminal sequence as bait, we demonstrate that BRAM1 (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-associated molecule 1) is an LMP1-interacting protein. BRAM1 associates with LMP1, both in vitro and in vivo, as revealed by confocal microscopy, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation assays. This association mainly involves the C-terminal half of BRAM1 comprising the MYND domain and the CTAR2 region of LMP1, which is critical in LMP1-mediated signaling pathways. We show that BRAM1 interferes with LMP1-mediated NF-kappaB activation but not the JNK signaling pathway. Because the CTAR2 region interacts with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha receptor-associated death domain protein, it is interesting to find that BRAM1 also interferes with NF-kappaB activation mediated by TNF-alpha. BRAM1 interferes LMP1-mediated and TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation by targeting IkappaBalpha molecules. Moreover, BRAM1 inhibits the resistance of LMP1-expressing cells to TNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity. We therefore propose that the BRAM1 molecule associates with LMP1 and functions as a negative regulator of LMP1-mediated biological functions."
17959659,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein interacts with CD74 and modulates major histocompatibility complex class II presentation.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu accessory protein is a transmembrane protein that down regulates CD4 expression and promotes the release of new virions. We screened a human leukocyte-specific yeast two-hybrid expression library to discover novel Vpu-interacting cellular proteins. The major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) invariant chain, also called Ii or CD74, was found to be one such protein. We show direct binding of Vpu and CD74 by using a yeast two-hybrid assay and coimmunoprecipitation from HIV-1-infected cells. The cytoplasmic region of Vpu was found to interact with the 30-amino-acid cytoplasmic tail of CD74. Human monocytic U937 cells infected with wild-type or Vpu-defective HIV-1 and transfected cells showed that Vpu down modulated the surface expression of mature MHC II molecules. The reduction in cell surface mature MHC II molecules correlated with decreased antigen presentation to T cells in culture. Thus, the Vpu protein also contributes to viral persistence by attenuating immune responses during HIV infection. This report further exemplifies the rich diversity and redundancy shown by HIV in immune evasion."
16150693,Murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 latency protein M2 binds to Vav signaling proteins and inhibits B-cell receptor-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in WEHI-231 B cells.,"The MHV-68 latent protein, M2, does not have homology to any known viral or cellular proteins, and its function is unclear. To define the role played by M2 during MHV-68 latency as well as the molecular mechanism involved, we used M2 as bait to screen a yeast two-hybrid mouse B-cell cDNA library. Vav1 was identified as an M2-interacting protein in two independent screenings. Subsequent yeast two-hybrid interaction studies showed that M2 also binds to Vav2, but not Vav3, and that three ""PXXP"" motifs located at the C terminus of M2 are important for this interaction. The interactions between M2 and Vav proteins were also confirmed in vivo in 293T and WEHI-231 B-cells by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Rac1/GST-PAK ""pull-down"" experiments and Western blot analysis using a phospho-Vav antibody demonstrated that expression of M2 in WEHI-231 cells enhances Vav activity. We further showed in WEHI-231 cells that M2 expression promotes proliferation and survival and is associated with enhanced cyclin D2 and repressed p27(Kip1), p130, and Bim expression. Taken together, these experiments suggest that M2 might have an important role in disseminating the latent virus during the establishment and maintenance of latency by modulating B-cell receptor-mediated signaling events through Vav to promote B-cell activation, proliferation, and survival."
8955054,"Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-3 and -4 interact with RBP-2N, a major isoform of RBP-J kappa in B lymphocytes.","The Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA)-3 and EBNA-4 proteins are thought to act as transcriptional transactivators. The yeast two-hybrid system and coimmunoprecipitation were used to demonstrate that EBNA-3 and -4 associate with the DNA-binding protein RBP-2N, an isoform of RBP-J kappa. A comparison between EBNA-3, EBNA-4, and EBNA-6 binding to RBP-2N indicated that EBNA-3 enhanced beta-galactosidase activity 4-fold more than EBNA-6 and 30-fold more than EBNA-4. Assay of RBP-2N deletion mutants demonstrated that EBNA-3 binds to regions of RBP-2N which are distinct from those to which EBNA-2 and -6 interact, whereas EBNA-4 binds to the same region of RBP-2N as EBNA-2 and -6 (amino acids 159-331 of RBP-2N). Interaction of both A- and B-type EBNA-3 with RBP-2N was also demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. RT-PCR analysis of a panel of B cell lymphomas and lymphoblastoid cell lines demonstrated that higher levels of RBP-2N were expressed, in comparison to RBP-J kappa, indicating that RBP-2N is a major isoform expressed in B cells. These results suggest that all the EBNA-3 family proteins lead to transcriptional regulation via interaction with RBP-2N."
14999100,A single amino acid difference in the host APOBEC3G protein controls the primate species specificity of HIV type 1 virion infectivity factor.,"The HIV type 1 (HIV-1) virion infectivity factor (Vif) protein blocks the action of the host defense factor APOBEC3G in human cells, thereby allowing release of infectious virions, but fails to inhibit similar APOBEC3G proteins present in some simian cells. Conversely, the Vif protein encoded by the African green monkey (agm) simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) can block agm APOBEC3G function but fails to inhibit human APOBEC3G. This difference plays a key role in determining the primate species tropism of HIV-1 and SIV agm. Here, we demonstrate that a single APOBEC3G residue, which is an aspartic acid in human APOBEC3G and a lysine in agm APOBEC3G, controls the ability of the HIV-1 Vif protein to bind and inactivate these host defense factors. These data identify a critical charged residue that plays a key role in mediating the formation of the distinct Vif:APOBEC3G complexes formed in human and simian cells. Moreover, these results suggest that the biological barrier preventing the entry of additional SIV into the human population as zoonotic infections is potentially quite fragile."
11971966,Physical interaction of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 stimulates the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein.,"The Tax oncoprotein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) induces leukemia in transgenic mice and permanent T-cell growth in vitro. In transformed lymphocytes, it acts as an essential growth factor. Tax stimulates the cell cycle in the G(1) phase by activating the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) CDK4 and CDK6 holoenzyme complexes. Here we show that Tax directly interacts with CDK4. This binding to CDK4 was specific, since Tax did not bind to either CDK2 or CDK1. The interaction with CDK4/cyclin D complexes was observed in vitro, in transfected fibroblasts, in HTLV-1-infected T cells, and in adult T-cell leukemia-derived cultures. Binding studies with several point and deletion mutants indicated that the N terminus of Tax mediates the interaction with CDK4. The Tax/CDK complex represented an active holoenzyme which capably phosphorylates the Rb protein in vitro and is resistant to repression by the inhibitor p21(CIP). Binding-deficient Tax mutants failed to activate CDK4, indicating that direct association with Tax is required for enhanced kinase activity. Tax also increased the association of CDK4 with its positive cyclin regulatory subunit. Thus, protein-protein contact between Tax and the components of the cyclin D/CDK complexes provides a further mechanistic explanation for the mitogenic and immortalizing effects of this HTLV-1 oncoprotein."
15767367,Vaccinia virus protein A46R targets multiple Toll-like-interleukin-1 receptor adaptors and contributes to virulence.,"Viral immune evasion strategies target key aspects of the host antiviral response. Recently, it has been recognized that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have a role in innate defense against viruses. Here, we define the function of the vaccinia virus (VV) protein A46R and show it inhibits intracellular signalling by a range of TLRs. TLR signalling is triggered by homotypic interactions between the Toll-like-interleukin-1 resistance (TIR) domains of the receptors and adaptor molecules. A46R contains a TIR domain and is the only viral TIR domain-containing protein identified to date. We demonstrate that A46R targets the host TIR adaptors myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), MyD88 adaptor-like, TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF), and the TRIF-related adaptor molecule and thereby interferes with downstream activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor kappaB. TRIF mediates activation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and induction of IFN-beta by TLR3 and TLR4 and suppresses VV replication in macrophages. Here, A46R disrupted TRIF-induced IRF3 activation and induction of the TRIF-dependent gene regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted. Furthermore, we show that A46R is functionally distinct from another described VV TLR inhibitor, A52R. Importantly, VV lacking the A46R gene was attenuated in a murine intranasal model, demonstrating the importance of A46R for VV virulence."
10364319,Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C interacts with histone deacetylase to repress transcription.,"EBNA3C can specifically repress the expression of reporter plasmids containing EBV Cp latency-associated promoter elements. Cp is normally the main promoter for EBNA mRNA initiation, so it appears that EBNA3C contributes to a negative autoregulatory control loop. By mutational analysis it was previously established that this repression is consistent with EBNA3C being targeted to Cp by binding the cellular sequence-specific DNA-binding protein CBF1 (also known as recombination signal-binding protein [RBP]-Jkappa. Further analysis suggested that in vivo a corepressor interacts with EBNA3C in this DNA binding complex. Results presented here are all consistent with a component of such a corepressor exhibiting histone deacetylase activity. The drug trichostatin A, which specifically inhibits histone deacetylases, relieved two- to threefold the repression of Cp induced by EBNA3C in two different cell types. Moreover, repression of pTK-CAT-Cp4x by EBNA3C was specifically enhanced by cotransfection of an expression plasmid for human histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1). Consistent with these functional assays, in vitro-translated HDAC1 bound to a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein including full-length EBNA3C, and in the reciprocal experiment EBNA3C bound to a GST fusion with the N terminus of HDAC1. Coimmunoprecipitations also revealed an EBNA3C-HDAC1 interaction in vivo, and GST-EBNA3C bound functional histone deacetylase enzyme activity from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The region of EBNA3C involved in the interaction with HDAC1 appears to correspond to the region which is necessary for binding to CBF1/RBP-Jkappa. A direct physical interaction between EBNA3C and HDAC1 was demonstrated with recombinant proteins purified from bacterial cells, and we therefore conclude that HDAC1 and CBF1/RBP-Jkappa bind to the same or adjacent regions of EBNA3C. These data suggest that recruitment of histone deacetylase activity makes a significant contribution to the repression of transcription from Cp because EBNA3C bridges an interaction between CBF1/RBP-Jkappa and HDAC1."
11880649,Antivirally active MxA protein sequesters La Crosse virus nucleocapsid protein into perinuclear complexes.,"Bunyaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. New viral particles are formed by budding of nucleocapsids into the Golgi apparatus. We have previously shown that the IFN-induced human MxA protein inhibits bunyavirus replication by an unknown mechanism. Here we demonstrate that MxA binds to the nucleocapsid protein of La Crosse virus (LACV) and colocalizes with the viral protein in cytoplasmic complexes. Electron microscopy revealed that these complexes accumulated in the perinuclear area and consisted of highly ordered fibrillary structures. A similar MxA-mediated redistribution of viral nucleocapsid proteins was detected with other bunyaviruses, such as Bunyamwera virus and Rift Valley fever virus. MxA(E645R), a carboxy-terminal mutant of MxA without antiviral activity against LACV, did not lead to complex formation. Wild-type MxA, but not MxA(E645R), was able to bind to LACV nucleocapsid protein in coimmunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating the importance of the carboxy-terminal effector domain of MxA. These results illustrate an efficient mechanism of IFN action whereby an essential virus component is trapped in cytoplasmic inclusions and becomes unavailable for the generation of new virus particles."
10792988,HTLV-1 tax oncoprotein binds to DNA topoisomerase I and inhibits its catalytic activity.,"HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein exerts pleiotropic effects on cellular regulatory systems, such as transcription and the cell cycle, through the interaction with various cellular factors. During our search for additional cellular targets of Tax using a yeast two-hybrid screening system, we isolated a cDNA encoding human DNA topoisomerase I. Tax was demonstrated to bind to topoisomerase I in vitro, and the Tax-topoisomerase I complex was also detected in HTLV-1-infected T-cells by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, Tax inhibited the catalytic activity of topoisomerase I as measured by relaxation of supercoiled DNA, although complete inhibition was not observed under the conditions used. The binding of topoisomerase I to DNA was inhibited by the addition of the wild type of Tax but not by a mutant of Tax that cannot bind to topoisomerase I. Consistent with these observations, expression of Tax induced an in vivo reduction of the covalent association of topoisomerase I with chromosomal DNA, which accumulates in the presence of camptothecin. These results suggest that Tax has a novel potential to affect various cellular processes such as transcription and maintenance of genomic stability, in which DNA topoisomerase I is involved."
16164752,The HTLV-1 Tax protein binding domain of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) includes the regulatory PSTAIRE helix.,The Tax oncoprotein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is leukemogenic in transgenic mice and induces permanent T-cell growth in vitro. It is found in active CDK holoenzyme complexes from adult T-cell leukemia-derived cultures and stimulates the G1- to-S phase transition by activating the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) CDK4. The Tax protein directly and specifically interacts with CDK4 and cyclin D2 and binding is required for enhanced CDK4 kinase activity. The protein-protein contact between Tax and the components of the cyclin D/CDK complexes increases the association of CDK4 and its positive regulatory subunit cyclin D and renders the complex resistant to p21CIP inhibition. Tax mutants affecting the N-terminus cannot bind cyclin D and CDK4.
12740372,"Importin alpha nuclear localization signal binding sites for STAT1, STAT2, and influenza A virus nucleoprotein.","Proteins actively transported into the nucleus via the classical nuclear import pathway contain nuclear localization signals (NLSs), which are recognized by the family of importin alpha molecules. Importin alpha contains 10 armadillo (arm) repeats, of which the N-terminal arm repeats 2-4 have been considered as the ""major"" NLS binding site. Interferon-activated, dimerized signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT2) directly bind to importin alpha5 via a dimeric nonclassical NLS. Here we show by site-directed mutagenesis that the very C-terminal arm repeats 8 and 9 of importin alpha5 form a unique binding site for STAT1 homodimers and STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers. Influenza A virus nucleoprotein also contains a nonclassical NLS that is recognized by the C-terminal NLS binding site of importin alpha5, comprising arm repeats 7-9. Binding of influenza A virus nucleoprotein to importin alpha3 also occurs via the C-terminal arm repeats. Simian virus 40 large T antigen instead binds to the major N-terminal arm repeats of importin alpha3, indicating that one importin alpha molecule is able to use either its N- or C-terminal arm repeats for binding various NLS containing proteins."
17121805,E6AP-dependent degradation of DLG4/PSD95 by high-risk human papillomavirus type 18 E6 protein.,"In most cervical cancers, DNAs of high-risk mucosotropic human papillomaviruses (HPVs), such as types 16 and 18, are maintained so as to express two viral proteins, E6 and E7, suggesting that they play important roles in carcinogenesis. The carboxy-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif of the E6 proteins is in fact essential for transformation of rodent cells and induction of hyperplasia in E6-transgenic mouse skin. To date, seven PDZ domain-containing proteins, including DLG1/hDLG, which is a human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor (Dlg), have been identified as targets of high-risk HPV E6 proteins. Here, we describe DLG4/PSD95, another human homologue of Dlg, as a novel E6 target. DLG4 was found to be expressed in normal human cells, including cervical keratinocytes, but only to a limited extent in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative cervical cancer cell lines. Expression of HPV18 E6 in HCK1T decreased DLG4 levels more strongly than did HPV16 E6, the carboxy-terminal motif of the proteins being critical for binding and degradation of DLG4 in vitro. DLG4 levels were restored by expression of either E6AP-specific short hairpin RNA or bovine papillomavirus type 1 E2 in HeLa but not CaSki or SiHa cells, reflecting downregulation of DLG4 mRNA as opposed to protein by an HPV-independent mechanism in HPV16-positive cancer lines. The tumorigenicity of CaSki cells was strongly inhibited by forced expression of DLG4, while growth in culture was not inhibited at all. These results suggest that DLG4 may function as a tumor suppressor in the development of HPV-associated cancers."
15371598,"Guanidine alkaloid analogs as inhibitors of HIV-1 Nef interactions with p53, actin, and p56lck.","With current anti-HIV treatments targeting only 4 of the 15 HIV proteins, many potential viral vulnerabilities remain unexploited. We report small-molecule inhibitors of the HIV-1 protein Nef. In addition to expanding the anti-HIV arsenal, small-molecule inhibitors against untargeted HIV proteins could be used to dissect key events in the HIV lifecycle. Numerous incompletely characterized interactions between Nef and cellular ligands, for example, present a challenge to understanding molecular events during HIV progression to AIDS. Assays with phage-displayed Nef from HIV(NL4-3) were used to identify a series of guanidine alkaloid-based inhibitors of Nef interactions with p53, actin, and p56(lck). The guanidines, synthetic analogs of batzellidine and crambescidin natural products, inhibit the Nef-ligand interactions with IC(50) values in the low micromolar range. In addition, sensitive in vivo assays for Nef inhibition are reported. Although compounds that are effective in vitro proved to be too cytotoxic for cellular assays, the reported Nef inhibitors provide proof-of-concept for disrupting a new HIV target and offer useful leads for drug development."
10950981,"The potential terminase subunit of human cytomegalovirus, pUL56, is translocated into the nucleus by its own nuclear localization signal and interacts with importin alpha.","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA-binding protein pUL56 is thought to be involved in the cleavage/packaging process of viral DNA and therefore needs to be transported into the nucleus. By using indirect immunofluorescence analysis, HCMV pUL56 (p130) was found to be localized predominantly in the nucleus of infected cells. Solitary expression of wild-type as well as epitope-tagged pUL56 also resulted in nuclear distribution after transfection, suggesting the presence of an endogenous nuclear localization signal (NLS). Deletion of a carboxy-terminal stretch of basic amino acids (aa 816-827) prevented nuclear translocation, indicating that the sequence RRVRATRKRPRR of HCMV pUL56 mediates nuclear targetting. The signal character of the NLS sequence was demonstrated by successful transfer of the NLS to a reporter protein chimera. Furthermore, sequential substitutions of pairs of amino acids by alanine in the context of the reporter protein as well as substitutions within the full-length pUL56 sequence indicated that residues at positions 7 and 8 of the NLS (R and K at positions 822 and 823 of pUL56) were essential for nuclear translocation. In order to identify the transport machinery involved, the potential of pUL56 to bind importin alpha (hSRP1 alpha) was examined. Clear evidence of a direct interaction of a carboxy-terminal portion as well as the NLS of pUL56 with hSRP1 alpha was provided by in vitro binding assays. In view of these findings, it is suggested that nuclear translocation of HCMV pUL56 is mediated by the importin-dependent pathway."
16038965,Protein profiling and identification of modulators regulated by human papillomavirus 16 E7 oncogene in HaCaT keratinocytes by proteomics.,Viral oncogenes E6 and E7 are selectively retained and expressed in carcinoma cells infected with human papillomavirus type 16 and cooperated with each other in immortalization and transformation of primary keratinocytes. This study was performed to identify proteins to be bound or modulated by high risk HPV E7 oncogene by using a proteomics.
12674498,Hepatitis B virus HBx peptide 116-138 and proteasome activator PA28 compete for binding to the proteasome alpha4/MC6 subunit.,PA28 is a modulator of the 20S proteasome. The PA28 binding sites on the 20S proteasome are still not well defined. Using yeast two-hybrid interaction assays and proteasome inactivation kinetics we provide evidence that the proteasome alpha4 subunit is one of the PA28 binding sites. This finding is supported by the observation that a hepatitis B virus X protein-derived polypeptide habouring the alpha4 proteasome subunit binding motif impairs the activation of 20S proteasomes by PA28.
15681409,"Leucine-specific, functional interactions between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef and adaptor protein complexes.","The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virulence protein Nef interacts with the endosomal sorting machinery via a leucine-based motif. Similar sequences within the cytoplasmic domains of cellular transmembrane proteins bind to the adaptor protein (AP) complexes of coated vesicles to modulate protein traffic, but the molecular basis of the interactions between these motifs and the heterotetrameric complexes is controversial. To identify the target of the Nef leucine motif, the native sequence was replaced with either leucine- or tyrosine-based AP-binding sequences from cellular proteins, and the interactions with AP subunits were correlated with function. Tyrosine motifs predictably modulated the interactions between Nef and the mu subunits of AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3; heterologous leucine motifs caused little change in these interactions. Conversely, leucine motifs mediated a ternary interaction between Nef and hemicomplexes containing the sigma1 plus gamma subunits of AP-1 or the sigma3 plus delta subunits of AP-3, whereas tyrosine motifs did not. Similarly, only leucine motifs supported the Nef-mediated association of AP-1 and AP-3 with endosomal membranes in cells treated with brefeldin A. Functionally, Nef proteins containing leucine motifs down-regulated CD4 from the cell surface and enhanced viral replication, whereas those containing tyrosine motifs were inactive. Apparently, the interaction of Nef with the mu subunits of AP complexes is insufficient for function. A leucine-specific mode of interaction that likely involves AP hemicomplexes is further required for Nef activity. The mu and hemicomplex interactions may cooperate to yield high avidity binding of AP complexes to Nef. This binding likely underlies the unusual ability of Nef to induce the stabilization of these complexes on endosomal membranes, an activity that correlates with enhancement of viral replication."
12058068,Subunit H of the V-ATPase involved in endocytosis shows homology to beta-adaptins.,"The vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit enzyme that facilitates the acidification of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells and plays an important role in receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular trafficking processes, and protein degradation. In this study we show that the C-terminal fragment of 350 residues of the regulatory subunit H (V1H) of the V-ATPase shares structural and functional homologies with the beta-chains of adaptor protein complexes. Moreover, the fragment is similar to a region in the beta-subunit of COPI coatomer complexes, which suggests the existence of a shared domain in these three different families of proteins. For beta-adaptins, this fragment binds to cytoplasmic di-leucine-based sorting motifs such as in HIV-1 Nef that mediate endocytic trafficking. Expression of this fragment in cells blocks the internalization of transmembrane proteins, which depend on di-leucine-based motifs, whereas mutation of the consensus sequence GEY only partly diminishes the recognition of the sorting motif. Based on recent structural analysis, our results suggest that the di-leucine-binding domain consists of a HEAT or ARM repeat protein fold."
12007002,[Interaction between HTLV-1 transcription activator tax and Taxreb107].,"Tax is a transcription activator encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-1. Ribosomal protein L6 was also defined as Taxreb107 (Tax responsible element binding protein 107) for its activity of binding to the long terminal repeats of HTLV-1. To investigate the relationship between Tax and Taxreb107/RpL6, yeast two hybrid and GST pull-down assays were used. Results suggest that Tax can interact with Taxreb107/RpL6 directly and Taxreb107/RpL6 may regulate the function of Tax in HTLV-1 proliferation."
14517060,"Mason-Pfizer monkey virus Gag proteins interact with the human sumo conjugating enzyme, hUbc9.","Retroviral Gag proteins function during early and late stages of the viral life cycle. To gain additional insight into the cellular requirements for viral replication, a two-hybrid screen was used to identify cellular proteins that interact with the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus Gag protein. One of the cellular proteins found was identified as hUbc9, a nuclear pore-associated E2 SUMO conjugating enzyme. In vitro protein interaction assays verified the association and mapped the interaction domain to the CA protein. In vivo, hUbc9 and Gag colocalized in the cytoplasm as discrete foci near the nuclear membrane. In addition, overexpression of hUbc9 in cells caused a fraction of Gag to colocalize with hUbc9 in the nucleus. These experiments demonstrate that hUbc9 and Gag interact in cells, strengthen the hypothesis that Gag proteins transiently associate with the nuclear compartment during viral replication, and suggest that hUbc9 plays a role in this process."
7831767,"NPI-1, the human homolog of SRP-1, interacts with influenza virus nucleoprotein.","We used the yeast interactive trap system to identify a cellular protein which interacts with the nucleoprotein of influenza A viruses. This protein, nucleoprotein interactor 1 (NPI-1) is the human homolog of the yeast protein SRP1. SRP1 was previously identified as a suppressor of temperature-sensitive RNA polymerase I mutations (R. Yano, M. Oakes, M. Yamaghishi, J. Dodd, and M. Nomura, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 5640-5651, 1992). A full-length cDNA clone of NPI-1 was generated from HeLa cell poly A + RNA. The viral nucleoprotein, which had been partially purified from influenza A/PR/8/34 virus-infected embryonated eggs, could be coprecipitated from solution by glutathione agarose beads complexed with a bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase-NPI-1 fusion protein, confirming the results of the yeast genetic system. Antisera raised against NPI-1 identified a 60-kDa polypeptide from total cellular extracts of both HeLa and MDBK cells. The viral nucleoprotein was coimmunoprecipitated from influenza A/WSN/33 virus-infected MDBK cells by anti-NPI-1 sera, demonstrating an interaction of these two proteins in infected cells. Similarly, NPI-1 was coimmunoprecipitated from MDBK cells by anti-NP sera. These experiments suggest that NPI-1 plays a role during influenza virus replication."
14659004,Endophilins interact with Moloney murine leukemia virus Gag and modulate virion production.,"The retroviral Gag protein is the central player in the process of virion assembly at the plasma membrane, and is sufficient to induce the formation and release of virus-like particles. Recent evidence suggests that Gag may co-opt the host cell's endocytic machinery to facilitate retroviral assembly and release."
7853484,The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein specifically binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CD4: implications for the mechanism of degradation.,"We have recently demonstrated that coexpression of Vpu and CD4 in HeLa cells results in the degradation of CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum. The sensitivity of CD4 to Vpu-mediated degradation is conferred by the presence of specific sequences located between amino acids 402 and 420 in the CD4 cytoplasmic domain. Using an in vitro translation system, we also showed that degradation of CD4 by Vpu requires the two proteins to be present in the same membrane compartment. Although these results suggest that spatial proximity between CD4 and Vpu may be critical in triggering degradation, it remains unknown whether the two molecules have the ability to interact with each other. In order to better define the mechanisms involved in CD4 degradation, we investigated the existence and functional relevance of direct interactions between CD4 and Vpu. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Vpu specifically binds to the cytoplasmic tail of CD4. This phenomenon is relevant to the mechanism of CD4 degradation since the ability of CD8/CD4 chimeric molecules and various CD4 mutants to form complexes with Vpu correlates with their sensitivity to degradation. Accordingly, we found that amino acid residues in the CD4 cytoplasmic tail previously shown to be important for degradation are necessary for Vpu binding. We further demonstrate that a deletion mutant of Vpu as well as a phosphorylation mutant, both biologically inactive with regard to CD4 degradation, retained the capacity to interact with the CD4 cytoplasmic domain. Taken together, these results indicate that Vpu binding is necessary to trigger CD4 degradation. However, the binding to target molecules is not sufficient per se to cause degradation. Interaction between CD4 and Vpu is thus likely to be an early event critical in triggering a multistep process leading to CD4 degradation."
7645215,"The HPV16 E5 protein: expression, detection, and stable complex formation with transmembrane proteins in COS cells.","The human papillomavirus-16 (HPV16) E5 gene is able to induce stable growth transformation and transient mitogenic stimulation in a variety of cultured cell systems. To characterize the biochemical properties of the hydrophobic HPV16 E5 transforming protein, we have constructed vectors expressing the wild-type HPV16 E5 gene and have generated antipeptide antisera. The 10-kDa E5 protein was readily detectable in transfected COS monkey cells by using these antisera either for immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled cells or for immunoblotting. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of cells coexpressing the viral protein and various growth factor receptors demonstrated stable complex formation between the E5 protein and the epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor, colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, and p185neu. The E5 protein also formed a stable complex with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. These experiments indicated that the HPV16 E5 protein was able to participate in complex formation with a variety of transmembrane proteins, a property which may contribute to the biological activities of the viral protein. In addition, the expression vectors and antibodies described here will be useful reagents in examining various aspects of HPV16 E5 expression and function."
18353424,The highly conserved orthopoxvirus 68k ankyrin-like protein is part of a cellular SCF ubiquitin ligase complex.,"The 68k ankyrin-like protein (68k-ank) of unknown function is highly conserved among orthopoxviruses and contains ankyrin repeats and an F-box-like domain. We performed a yeast-two-hybrid screen with 68k-ank to find interacting proteins. From a human and a murine cDNA library, 99% of the interaction partners were S-phase kinase-associated protein 1a (Skp1a), a part of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. 68k-ank co-immunoprecipitated with components of the endogenous, mammalian SCF ubiquitin ligase. This interaction was F-box domain dependent and could also be observed in infected cells, indicating that SCF complex formation might be important for the viral life cycle."
10325410,Interaction of influenza virus NS1 protein and the human homologue of Staufen in vivo and in vitro.,"A screening for human proteins capable of interacting with influenza virus NS1 has been carried out using the two-hybrid genetic trap in yeast. A cDNA corresponding to the human homologue of Drosophila melanogaster Staufen protein (hStaufen) was isolated that fulfilled all genetic controls of the two-hybrid protocol. Using a hStaufen cDNA isolated from a lambda human library, the interaction of hStaufen and NS1 proteins was characterised in vivo and in vitro. Co-transfection of NS1 cDNA and a partial cDNA of hStaufen led to the relocalisation of recombinant hStaufen protein from its normal accumulation site in the cytoplasm to the nuclear location of NS1 protein. NS1 and hStaufen proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated from extracts of co-transfected cells and from mixtures of extracts containing either protein, as well as from extracts of influenza virus-infected cells. Furthermore, both proteins co-localised in the ribosomal and polysomal fractions of influenza virus-infected cells. The interaction was also detected in pull-down experiments using a resin containing purified hStaufen and NS1 protein translated in vitro. Deletion mapping of the NS1 gene indicated that a mutant protein containing the N-terminal 81 amino acids is unable to interact with hStaufen, in spite of retaining full RNA-binding capacity. These results are discussed in relation to the possible mechanisms of action of hStaufen and its relevance for influenza virus infection."
18987133,Epstein-Barr virus LF2: an antagonist to type I interferon.,"Upon viral infection, the major defense mounted by the host immune system is activation of the interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral pathway, which is mediated by IFN regulatory factors (IRFs). In order to complete their life cycle, viruses must modulate host IFN-mediated immune responses. Despite its association with significant human health problems, activities of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human tumor-inducing herpesvirus, to evade host IFN-mediated innate immunity have not been well characterized. To search for EBV genes that block IFN signal transduction, we carried out a screening of EBV open reading frames for their abilities to block IFN-alpha/beta-mediated luciferase expression upon Sendai virus infection. This screening demonstrates that EBV LF2 tegument protein specifically interacts with the central inhibitory association domain of IRF7, and this interaction leads to inhibition of the dimerization of IRF7, which suppresses IFN-alpha production and IFN-mediated immunity. This demonstrates a novel immune evasion mechanism of EBV LF2 in blocking cellular IRF7-mediated innate immunity."
18455505,Karyopherin beta3: a new cellular target for the HPV-16 E5 oncoprotein.,"Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the causative agents of cervical cancer worldwide, and that HPV-16 is associated with more than half of these cases. In addition to the well-characterized E6 and E7 oncoproteins of HPV-16, recent evidence increasingly has implicated the HPV-16 E5 protein (16E5) as an important mediator of oncogenic transformation. Since 16E5 has no known intrinsic enzymatic activity, its effects on infected cells are most likely mediated by interactions with various cellular proteins and/or its documented association with lipid rafts. In the present study, we describe a new cellular target that binds to 16E5 in COS cells and in stable human ectocervical cell lines. This target is karyopherin beta3, a member of the nuclear import receptor family with critical roles in the nuclear import of ribosomal proteins and in the secretory pathway."
8709241,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef associates with a member of the p21-activated kinase family.,"Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Nef is essential for the induction of AIDS, its biochemical function has remained an enigma. In this study, HIV Nef protein is shown to associate with a serine-threonine kinase that recognizes histone H4 as a substrate, is serologically related to rat p21-activated kinase (PAK), and is specifically activated by Rac and Cdc42. These characteristics define the Nef-associated kinase as belonging to the PAK family. PAKs initiate kinase cascades in response to environmental stimuli, and their identification as a target of Nef implicates these signaling molecules in HIV pathogenesis and provides a novel target for clinical intervention."
8253832,Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A is a cellular target of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev activation domain mediating trans-activation.,"Expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) structural proteins requires the presence of the viral trans-activator protein Rev. Rev is localized in the nucleus and binds specifically to the Rev response element (RRE) sequence in viral RNA. Furthermore, the interaction of the Rev activation domain with a cellular cofactor is essential for Rev function in vivo. Using cross-linking experiments and Biospecific Interaction Analysis (BIA) we identify eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) as a cellular factor binding specifically to the HIV-1 Rev activation domain. Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that a significant fraction of eIF-5A localizes to the nucleus. We also provide evidence that Rev transactivation is functionally mediated by eIF-5A in Xenopus oocytes. Furthermore, we are able to block Rev function in mammalian cells by antisense inhibition of eIF-5A gene expression. Thus, regulation of HIV-1 gene expression by Rev involves the targeting of RRE-containing RNA to components of the cellular translation initiation complex."
8419915,The type 1 human immunodeficiency virus Tat binding protein is a transcriptional activator belonging to an additional family of evolutionarily conserved genes.,"The type 1 human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein is a powerful transcriptional activator when bound to an RNA structure (TAR) present at the extreme 5' terminus of viral mRNA. Since transcriptional activation requires binding of Tat to RNA, it has been suggested that Tat enhances initiation or elongation through a direct interaction with cellular transcription factors. Here we show through protein fusion experiments that the previously identified cellular Tat binding protein, TBP-1, although unable to bind DNA, is a strong transcriptional activator when brought into proximity of several promoter elements. Transcriptional activity depends upon the integrity of at least two highly conserved domains: one resembling a nucleotide-binding motif and the other motif common to proteins with helicase activity. Our studies further reveal that TBP-1 represents one member of a large, highly conserved gene family that encodes proteins demonstrating strong amino acid conservation across species. Finally, we identified a second family member that, although 77% similar to TBP-1, does not activate transcription from the promoters examined. This finding, together with the observation that TBP-1 does not activate each promoter examined, suggests that this gene family may encode promoter-specific transcriptional activators."
15050687,"Proliferation inhibition of astrocytes, neurons, and non-glial cells by intracellularly expressed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein.","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein is one of the soluble neurotoxins. Most studies have to date focused on Tat as an extracellular molecule and its role in neuronal apoptosis, as recombinant Tat protein is often used in these studies. In this study, we expressed Tat protein in astrocytes and neurons, and examined its effects on these cells. We found that Tat expression resulted in growth inhibition of astrocytes, neurons, as well as non-glial cells 293T. We further showed that Tat interacted with a number of cell cycle-related proteins including cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin D3, Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk1/Cdc2, cdc6, p27, p53, p63, hdlg, and PCNA. These data demonstrate that Tat inhibited cell proliferation when expressed intracellularly, and suggest that Tat interactions with multiple cell cycle regulators may account for this anti-proliferative effect. These results support the notion that Tat-induced neuropathogenesis is mediated by multiple mechanisms involving both intracellular and extracellular Tat protein."
7745688,Protein domains involved in both in vivo and in vitro interactions between human T-cell leukemia virus type I tax and CREB.,"Gene expression from the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) long terminal repeat (LTR) is mediated by three cis-acting regulatory elements known as 21-bp repeats and the transactivator protein Tax. The 21-bp repeats can be subdivided into three motifs known as A, B, and C, each of which is important for maximal gene expression in response to Tax. The B motif contains nucleotide sequences known as a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) or tax-response element which binds members of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors. Though mutations of this element in the HTLV-I LTR eliminate tax activation, Tax will not activate most other promoters containing these CRE sites. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which Tax activates gene expression in conjunction with members of the ATF/CREB family. We found that Tax enhanced the binding of one member of the ATF/CREB family, CREB 1, to each of the three HTLV-I LTR 21-bp repeats but not another member designated CRE-BP1 or CREB2. Tax enhanced the binding of CREB1 to nonpalindromic CRE binding sites such as those found in the HTLV-I LTR, but Tax did not enhance the binding of CREB1 to palindromic CRE binding sites such as found in the somatostatin promoter. This finding may help explain the failure of Tax to activate promoters containing consensus CRE sites. These studies were extended by use of the mammalian two-hybrid system. Tax was demonstrated to interact directly with CREB1 but not with other bZIP proteins, including CREB2 and Jun. Site-directed mutagenesis of both Tax and CREB1 demonstrated that the amino terminus of Tax and both the basic and the leucine zipper regions of CREB1 were required for direct interactions between these proteins both in vivo and in vitro. This interaction occurred in vivo and thus did not require the presence of the HTLV-I 21-bp repeats, as previously suggested. These results define the domains required for interaction between Tax and CREB that are likely critical for the activation of HTLV-I gene expression."
11418688,Both E6 and E7 oncoproteins of human papillomavirus 16 inhibit IL-18-induced IFN-gamma production in human peripheral blood mononuclear and NK cells.,"Cervical carcinoma is the predominant cancer among malignancies in women throughout the world, and human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 is the most common agent linked to human cervical carcinoma. The present study was performed to investigate the mechanisms of immune escape in HPV-induced cervical cancer cells. The presence of HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 in the extracellular fluids of HPV-containing cervical cancer cell lines SiHa and CaSki was demonstrated by ELISA. The effect of HPV 16 oncoproteins E6 and E7 on the production of IFN-gamma by IL-18 was assessed. E6 and E7 proteins reduced IL-18-induced IFN-gamma production in both primary PBMCs and the NK0 cell line. FACS analysis revealed that the viral oncoproteins reduced the binding of IL-18 to its cellular surface receptors on NK0 cells, whereas there was no effect of oncoproteins on IL-1 binding to its surface IL-1 receptors on D10S, a subclone of the murine Th cell D10.G4.1. In vitro pull-down assays also revealed that the viral oncoproteins and IL-18 bound to IL-18R alpha-chain competitively. These results suggest that the extracellular HPV 16 E6 and E7 proteins may inhibit IL-18-induced IFN-gamma production locally in HPV lesions through inhibition of IL-18 binding to its alpha-chain receptor. Down-modulation of IL-18-induced immune responses by HPV oncoproteins may contribute to viral pathogenesis or carcinogenesis."
11264384,Direct in vitro binding of full-length human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein to CD4 cytoplasmic domain.,"The Nef protein of the simian and human immunodeficiency viruses is known to directly bind and downregulate the CD4 receptor. Although the molecular mechanism is well understood, direct binding of Nef and CD4 is difficult to demonstrate and is believed to be of low affinity. Applying nuclear magnetic resonance and fluorescence spectroscopy, we biophysically reevaluated the CD4-Nef complex and found the dissociation constant to be in the submicromolar range. We conclude that additional, so far disregarded residues in the N terminus of Nef are important for interaction with CD4."
10364329,Analysis of the effect of natural sequence variation in Tat and in cyclin T on the formation and RNA binding properties of Tat-cyclin T complexes.,"The biological activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat (Tat1) transcriptional activator requires the recruitment of a Tat1-CyclinT1 (CycT1) complex to the TAR RNA target encoded within the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). While other primate immunodeficiency viruses, such as HIV-2 and mandrill simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmnd), also encode Tat proteins that activate transcription via RNA targets, these proteins differ significantly, both from each other and from Tat1, in terms of their ability to activate transcription directed by LTR promoter elements found in different HIV and SIV isolates. Here, we show that CycT1 also serves as an essential cofactor for HIV-2 Tat (Tat2) and SIVmnd Tat (Tat-M) function. Moreover, the CycT1 complex formed by each Tat protein displays a distinct RNA target specificity that accurately predicts the level of activation observed with a particular LTR. While Tat2 and Tat-M share the ability of Tat1 to bind to CycT1, they differ from Tat1 in that they are also able to bind to the related but distinct CycT2. However, the resultant Tat-CycT2 complexes fail to bind TAR and are therefore abortive. Surprisingly, mutation of a single residue in CycT2 (asparagine 260 to cysteine) rescues the ability of CycT2 to bind Tat1 and also activates not only TAR binding by all three Tat-CycT2 complexes but also Tat function. Therefore, the RNA target specificity of different Tat-CycT1 complexes is modulated by natural sequence variation in both the viral Tat transcriptional activator and in the host cell CycT molecule recruited by Tat. Further, the RNA target specificity of the resultant Tat-CycT1 complex accurately predicts the ability of that complex to activate transcription from a given LTR promoter element."
15847701,Identification of a novel Rev-interacting cellular protein.,Human cell types respond differently to infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Defining specific interactions between host cells and viral proteins is essential in understanding how viruses exploit cellular functions and the innate strategies underlying cellular control of HIV replication. The HIV Rev protein is a post-transcriptional inducer of HIV gene expression and an important target for interaction with cellular proteins. Identification of Rev-modulating cellular factors may eventually contribute to the design of novel antiviral therapies.
9055856,Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional bcl-2 homologue.,Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a newly discovered herpesvirus etiologically associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and two lymphoproliferative disorders. We describe a KSHV vbcl-2 gene with homology to the proto-oncogene bcl-2. It is expressed in KS lesions and in cell lines derived from primary effusion lymphomas. Using yeast and human cells we demonstrate the ability of KSHV vBcl-2 protein to suppress Bax toxicity. We show that KSHV vBcl-2 heterodimerizes with human Bcl-2 in a yeast two-hybrid system. These results suggest that KSHV vBcl-2 plays an anti-apoptotic role in virus infected cells.
9021971,The hepatitis B virus X protein: the quest for a role in viral replication and pathogenesis.,"Although the biological importance of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBX) in the life cycle of hepatitis B virus has been well established, the cellular and molecular basis of its function remains largely undefined. Despite the association of multiple activities with HBX, none of them appear to provide a unifying hypothesis regarding the true biological function of HBX. Identification and characterization of cellular targets of HBX remain an essential goal in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of HBX. Using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid system, we have identified and characterized a novel subunit of the proteasome complex (XAPC7) that interacts specifically with HBX. We also showed that HBX binds specifically to XAPC7 in vitro. Mutagenesis studies have defined the domains of interaction to be critical for the function of HBX. Furthermore, overexpression of XAPC7 appeared to activate transcription by itself and antisense expression of XAPC7 was able to block transactivation by HBX. Therefore, the proteasome complex is possibly a functional target of HBX in cells."
14990717,US11 of herpes simplex virus type 1 interacts with HIPK2 and antagonizes HIPK2-induced cell growth arrest.,"Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a nuclear serine/threonine kinase of the subfamily of dual-specificity Yak1-related kinase proteins. HIPK2 was first described as a homeodomain-interacting protein kinase acting as a corepressor for homeodomain transcription factors. More recently, it was reported that HIPK2 plays a role in p53-mediated cellular apoptosis and could also participate in the regulation of the cell cycle. US11 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of several processes related to the survival of cells submitted to environmental stresses by mechanisms that are not fully elucidated. In an attempt to better understand the multiple functions of US11, we identified cellular binding partners of this protein by using the yeast two-hybrid system. We report that US11 interacts with HIPK2 through the PEST domain of HIPK2 and that this interaction occurs also in human cells. This interaction modifies the subcellular distribution of HIPK2 and protects the cell against the HIPK2-induced cell growth arrest."
15334674,Cytochrome C oxidase III interacts with hepatitis B virus X protein in vivo by yeast two-hybrid system.,To screen and identify the proteins which interact with hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein in hepatocytes by yeast two-hybrid system and to explore the effects of X protein in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
12767936,Association of hepatitis B virus polymerase with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies mediated by the S100 family protein p11.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase (Pol) interacts with cellular chaperone proteins and thereby performs multiple functions necessary for viral replication. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was applied to identify additional cellular targets required for HBV Pol function. HBV Pol interacted with S100A10 (p11), a Ca(2+)-modulated protein previously shown to bind to annexin II. The interaction between HBV Pol and p11 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins synthesized either in vitro or in transfected cells and by inhibition of the DNA polymerase activity of HBV Pol by p11. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected human cell lines revealed that, although most HBV Pol and p11 was restricted to the cytoplasm, a small proportion of each protein colocalized as nuclear speckles; HBV Pol was not detected in the nucleus in the absence of p11. The HBV Pol-p11 nuclear speckles coincided with nuclear bodies containing the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML. Furthermore, the association of HBV Pol-p11 with PML was increased by exposure of cells to EGTA and inhibited by valinomycin. These results suggest a role for p11 in modulation of HBV Pol function and implicate PML nuclear bodies and intracellular Ca(2+) in viral replication."
9199350,Regulation of the protein kinase PKR by the vaccinia virus pseudosubstrate inhibitor K3L is dependent on residues conserved between the K3L protein and the PKR substrate eIF2alpha.,"The mammalian double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR is a component of the cellular antiviral defense mechanism and phosphorylates Ser-51 on the alpha subunit of the translation factor eIF2 to inhibit protein synthesis. To identify the molecular determinants that specify substrate recognition by PKR, we performed a mutational analysis on the vaccinia virus K3L protein, a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKR. High-level expression of PKR is lethal in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae because PKR phosphorylates eIF2alpha and inhibits protein synthesis. We show that coexpression of vaccinia virus K3L can suppress the growth-inhibitory effects of PKR in yeast, and using this system, we identified both loss-of-function and hyperactivating mutations in K3L. Truncation of, or point mutations within, the C-terminal portion of the K3L protein, homologous to residues 79 to 83 in eIF2alpha, abolished PKR inhibitory activity, whereas the hyperactivating mutation, K3L-H47R, increased the homology between the K3L protein and eIF2alpha adjacent to the phosphorylation site at Ser-51. Biochemical and yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed that the suppressor phenotype of the K3L mutations correlated with the affinity of the K3L protein for PKR and was inversely related to the level of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in the cell. These results support the idea that residues conserved between the pseudosubstrate K3L protein and the authentic substrate eIF2alpha play an important role in substrate recognition, and they suggest that PKR utilizes sequences both near and over 30 residues from the site of phosphorylation for substrate recognition. Finally, by reconstituting part of the mammalian antiviral defense mechanism in yeast, we have established a genetically useful system to study viral regulators of PKR."
12560563,Physical interaction of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP) with human oestrogen-related receptor 1 (hERR1): hERR1 interacts with a conserved domain of EBNA-LP that is critical for EBV-induced B-cell immortalization.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP) consists of W1W2 repeats and a unique C-terminal Y1Y2 domain and plays a critical role in EBV-induced transformation. To identify the cellular proteins associating with EBNA-LP, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using EBNA-LP cDNA containing a single W1W2 domain as bait and an EBV-transformed human peripheral blood lymphocyte cDNA library as the source of cellular genes. Our results were as follows. (i) A cDNA in the positive yeast colony was found to encode a cellular protein, human oestrogen-related receptor 1 (hERR1), which is a constitutive transcriptional activator of the various types of oestrogen response elements. (ii) A purified chimeric protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to hERR1 specifically formed complexes with EBNA-LPs containing one (EBNA-LPR1), two (EBNA-LPR2) or four W1W2 repeats (EBNA-LPR4) transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Reciprocally, GST fused to EBNA-LPR1 or EBNA-LPR2 pulled down hERR1 transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. (iii) Mutational analyses of EBNA-LP revealed that the Y2 domain of EBNA-LP is responsible for the interaction with hERR1 and two leucines in the Y2 domain (Leu-78 and -82), which are conserved among a subset of primate gammaherpesviruses, are interactive sites for hERR1. So far, it has been reported that the only domain of EBNA-LP critical for EBV-induced transformation is the Y1Y2 domain. Potential roles of hERR1 in EBV-induced transformation are discussed."
17079289,Inhibition of retinoic acid-inducible gene I-mediated induction of beta interferon by the NS1 protein of influenza A virus.,"The retinoic acid-inducible gene I product (RIG-I) has been identified as a cellular sensor of RNA virus infection resulting in beta interferon (IFN-beta) induction. However, many viruses are known to encode viral products that inhibit IFN-beta production. In the case of influenza A virus, the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) prevents the induction of the IFN-beta promoter by inhibiting the activation of transcription factors, including IRF-3, involved in IFN-beta transcriptional activation. The inhibitory properties of NS1 appear to be due at least in part to its binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), resulting in the sequestration of this viral mediator of RIG-I activation. However, the precise effects of NS1 on the RIG-I-mediated induction of IFN-beta have not been characterized. We now report that the NS1 of influenza A virus interacts with RIG-I and inhibits the RIG-I-mediated induction of IFN-beta. This inhibition was apparent even when a mutant RIG-I that is constitutively activated (in the absence of dsRNA) was used to trigger IFN-beta production. Coexpression of RIG-I, its downstream signaling partner, IPS-1, and NS1 resulted in increased levels of RIG-I and NS1 within an IPS-1-rich, solubilization-resistant fraction after cell lysis. These results suggest that RIG-I, IPS-1, and NS1 become part of the same complex. Consistent with this idea, NS1 was also found to inhibit IFN-beta promoter activation by IPS-1 overexpression. Our results indicate that, in addition to sequestering dsRNA, the NS1 of influenza A virus binds to RIG-I and inhibits downstream activation of IRF-3, preventing the transcriptional induction of IFN-beta."
15099523,Vpu-mediated degradation of CD4 reconstituted in yeast reveals mechanistic differences to cellular ER-associated protein degradation.,"In HIV infected cells, the plasma membrane protein CD4 is removed from the secretory pathway by proteasomal digestion. This crucial step of viral infection occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum and is triggered by the HIV encoded protein Vpu. Here we show that this process can be recapitulated in baker's yeast. The analysis in the yeast system revealed that Vpu-induced breakdown of CD4 occurs independently of the cellular ER-associated protein degradation system. Moreover, our system allows direct comparison between Vpu-mediated turnover and cellular ER-associated protein degradation of CD4. This analysis suggests fundamental mechanistic differences between both pathways: Vpu-induced turnover strictly relies on ubiquitination of CD4 at cytosolic lysine residues prior to export of the substrate from the membrane. In contrast, the cellular ER-associated protein degradation pathway can transport ER-lumenal parts of CD4 into the cytoplasm before ubiquitination and extraction of the membrane anchor."
12941912,SR-related protein TAXREB803/SRL300 is an important cellular factor for the transactivational function of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax.,"Expression of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) genes is transcriptionally activated by the cognate oncoprotein Tax which enhances the binding of the cyclin AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) to the Tax responsive element (TxRE) located in its long terminal repeat (LTR). TxRE is highly homologous to the cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) except for the GC-rich sequence flanking the CRE. We cloned the cDNA for a cellular factor, TAXREB803, of which the DNA-binding domain bound to TxRE and the binding was dependent on the 3' GC-rich sequence in TxRE. TAXREB803 is an SR-related protein composed of 2,752 amino acids including numerous arginine/serine (RS) motifs. TAXREB803 enhanced both the Tax dependent transcription and the CREB binding to TxRE in cooperation with Tax. The interaction of TAXREB803 and Tax was detected by coimmunoprecipitation assays as well as by indirect immunofluorescence assays. Significantly, Tax transactivation for the HTLV-1 LTR decreased dramatically when the expression level of the endogenous TAXREB803 was suppressed by the small interfering RNA. These results suggest that TAXREB803 functions as a transcriptional coactivator for Tax and plays a critical role in the expression of HTLV-1 genes."
15956605,Detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef and CD4 physical interaction in living human cells by using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer.,"CD4 down-regulation by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef protein is a key function for virus virulence. This activity may be mediated by a direct Nef-CD4 interaction. We investigated the formation, in situ, of such a complex between proteins using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer technology and co-immunoprecipitations. Our data clearly demonstrate that Nef and CD4 interact in intact human cells. Moreover, our results clearly indicate that the dileucine motif of the CD4 cytoplasmic domain, critical for the Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation, is not implicated in the Nef/CD4 complex formation in the cellular context."
17928350,Ebola virus VP24 proteins inhibit the interaction of NPI-1 subfamily karyopherin alpha proteins with activated STAT1.,"The Zaire ebolavirus protein VP24 was previously demonstrated to inhibit alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta)- and IFN-gamma-induced nuclear accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 (PY-STAT1) and to inhibit IFN-alpha/beta- and IFN-gamma-induced gene expression. These properties correlated with the ability of VP24 to interact with the nuclear localization signal receptor for PY-STAT1, karyopherin alpha1. Here, VP24 is demonstrated to interact not only with overexpressed but also with endogenous karyopherin alpha1. Mutational analysis demonstrated that VP24 binds within the PY-STAT1 binding region located in the C terminus of karyopherin alpha1. In addition, VP24 was found to inhibit PY-STAT1 binding to both overexpressed and endogenous karyopherin alpha1. We assessed the binding of both PY-STAT1 and the VP24 proteins from Zaire, mouse-adapted Zaire, and Reston Ebola viruses for interaction with all six members of the human karyopherin alpha family. We found, in contrast to previous studies, that PY-STAT1 can interact not only with karyopherin alpha1 but also with karyopherins alpha5 and alpha6, which together comprise the NPI-1 subfamily of karyopherin alphaS. Similarly, all three VP24s bound and inhibited PY-STAT1 interaction with karyopherins alpha1, alpha5, and alpha6. Consistent with their ability to inhibit the karyopherin-PY-STAT1 interaction, Zaire, mouse-adapted Zaire, and Reston Ebola virus VP24s displayed similar capacities to inhibit IFN-beta-induced gene expression in human and mouse cells. These findings suggest that VP24 inhibits interaction of PY-STAT1 with karyopherins alpha1, alpha5, or alpha6 by binding within the PY-STAT1 binding region of the karyopherins and that this function is conserved among the VP24 proteins of different Ebola virus species."
12237292,Carboxyl terminus of hVIP/mov34 is critical for HIV-1-Vpr interaction and glucocorticoid-mediated signaling.,"Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) vpr is a highly conserved gene among lentiviruses. The diverse functions of Vpr support interactions of this HIV accessory protein with host cell partners of important pathways. hVIP/mov34 (human Vpr Interacting Protein) is one of these identified Vpr ligands. hVIP is a 34-kDa member of the eIF3 family that is vital for early embryonic development in transgenic mice and important in cell cycle regulation. Its interaction with Vpr, however, is not yet clearly defined. Therefore, we constructed a panel of deletion mutants of this cytoplasmic cellular ligand to map the protein domain that mediates its interaction with Vpr. We observed that the carboxyl-terminal region of hVIP is critical for its interaction with Vpr. In the absence of Vpr or HIV infection, full-length hVIP is expressed in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization pattern of full-length hVIP protein, however, is shifted to a clear nuclear localization pattern in cells expressing both hVIP and Vpr. In contrast, Vpr did not alter the localization pattern of hVIP mutants, which have their carboxyl-terminal domain deleted. The movement of hVIP supported prior work that suggested that Vpr triggers activation of the GR receptor complex. In fact, we also observed that dexamethasone moves hVIP into the nucleus and that glucocorticoid antagonists inhibit this effect. Interestingly, the expression of an hVIP carboxyl-terminal mutant, which is not responsive to Vpr, is also not responsive to dexamethasone. These data illustrate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of hVIP is critical for mediating hVIP-Vpr interaction as well as for its glucocorticoid response. These results support the view that hVIP is a member of the complex array of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins that are regulated by HIV infection and glucocorticoids."
15542637,Identification of Epstein-Barr virus RK-BARF0-interacting proteins and characterization of expression pattern.,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BamHI A transcripts are a family of transcripts that are differentially spliced and can be detected in multiple EBV-associated malignancies. Several of the transcripts may encode proteins. One transcript of interest, RK-BARF0, is proposed to encode a 279-amino-acid protein with a possible endoplasmic reticulum-targeting sequence. In this study, the properties of RK-BARF0 were examined through identification of cellular-interacting proteins through yeast two-hybrid analysis and characterization of its expression in EBV-infected cells and tumors. In addition to the interaction previously identified with cellular Notch, it was determined that RK-BARF0 also bound cellular human I-mfa domain-containing protein (HIC), epithelin, and scramblase. An interaction between RK-BARF0 and Notch or epithelin induced proteasome-dependent degradation of Notch and epithelin but not of HIC or scramblase. Low levels of endogenous Notch expression in EBV-positive cell lines may correlate with RK-BARF0 expression. However, a screen of EBV-positive cell lines and tumors with an affinity-purified alpha-RK-BARF0 antiserum did not consistently detect RK-BARF0. These data suggest that while RK-BARF0 may have important cellular functions during EBV infection, and while the phenotype of EBV-positive cells suggest its expression, RK-BARF0 levels may be too low to detect."
11278515,A gamma-2 herpesvirus nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein interacts with importin alpha 1 and alpha 5.,"Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is the prototype gamma-2 herpesvirus. This is an increasing important subfamily of herpesviruses due to the identification of the first human gamma-2 herpesvirus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. The HVS open reading frame (ORF) 57 protein is a multifunctional trans-regulatory protein homologous to genes identified in all classes of herpesviruses. Recent analysis has demonstrated that ORF 57 has the ability to bind viral RNA and to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and is required for efficient nuclear export of viral transcripts. Here we have investigated the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling mechanism utilized by the ORF 57 protein. The yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify interacting cellular proteins using ORF 57 as bait. We demonstrate that ORF 57 interacts with importin alpha isoforms 1 and 5. In addition, the binding of ORF 57 to importin alpha was mediated by the importin alpha hydrophobic internal armadillo repeats. An ORF 57 amino-terminal arginine-rich sequence, which functions as a nuclear localization sequence, was also required for this interaction. Furthermore, the ORF 57 protein is responsible for the redistribution of importin alpha into the nucleoli. These results identify novel cellular interactions essential for the functioning of this important herpesvirus regulatory protein."
11070042,A functional complex of adenovirus proteins E1B-55kDa and E4orf6 is necessary to modulate the expression level of p53 but not its transcriptional activity.,"In adenovirus-infected cells, binding of E1B-55kDa and E4orf6 to the tumor suppressor protein p53 inhibits its transcriptional activity and causes rapid turnover of the protein. To investigate the requirements of the E1B-E4orf6 complex to modulate p53 function, we generated an E4orf6 mutant that failed to associate functionally and physically with E1B-55kDa but still interacted with p53. We confirm that E4orf6 and E1B-55kDa reduce p53 transactivation individually and show that their combined inhibition is additive rather than synergistic. Furthermore, we found that downregulation of p53's expression level, but not transcriptional inhibition of p53, depends on a functional E1B-E4 complex. A functional interaction of E1B-55kDa with p53, on the other hand, is a prerequisite for both transcriptional repression and downregulation of p53. The separation of these two functions will enable further dissection of the requirements for oncogenicity by the E4orf6 protein."
8648759,Evidence that replication of human neurotropic JC virus DNA in glial cells is regulated by the sequence-specific single-stranded DNA-binding protein Pur alpha.,"Initiation of polyomavirus DNA replication in eukaryotic cells requires the participation of the viral early protein T antigen, cellular replication factors, and DNA polymerases. The human polyomavirus JC virus (JCV) is the etiologic agent of the fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immunocompromised individuals. This virus exhibits a narrow host range and a tissue specificity that restricts its replication to glial cells of the central nervous system. Restriction of viral DNA replication due to species specificity of the DNA polymerase, coupled with glial cell-specific transcription of the viral early promoter, is thought to account for the brain-specific replication of JCV. In this report we demonstrate that overexpression of Pur alpha, a protein which binds to single-stranded DNA in a sequence-specific manner, suppresses replication of JCV DNA in glial cells. Results from footprinting studies indicate that Pur alpha and T antigen share a common binding region spanning the single-stranded ori sequence of JCV. Further, T antigen was capable of stimulating the association of Pur alpha with the ori sequence in a band shift assay. Whereas no evidence for simultaneous binding of Pur alpha and T antigen to single-stranded DNA has been observed, results from coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot (immunoblot) analyses of proteins derived from cells producing JCV T antigen indicate a molecular association of JCV T antigen and Pur alpha. The binding of Pur alpha to the single-stranded ori sequence and its association with T antigen suggest that Pur alpha interferes with the activity of T antigen and/or other regulatory proteins to exert its negative effect on JCV DNA replication. The importance of these findings in the reactivation of JCV in the latently infected individual under immunosuppressed conditions is discussed."
9819417,Inhibition of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR by vaccinia virus E3: role of complex formation and the E3 N-terminal domain.,"The human double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase PKR inhibits protein synthesis by phosphorylating translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). Vaccinia virus E3L encodes a dsRNA binding protein that inhibits PKR in virus-infected cells, presumably by sequestering dsRNA activators. Expression of PKR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibits protein synthesis by phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, dependent on its two dsRNA binding motifs (DRBMs). We found that expression of E3 in yeast overcomes the lethal effect of PKR in a manner requiring key residues (Lys-167 and Arg-168) needed for dsRNA binding by E3 in vitro. Unexpectedly, the N-terminal half of E3, and residue Trp-66 in particular, also is required for anti-PKR function. Because the E3 N-terminal region does not contribute to dsRNA binding in vitro, it appears that sequestering dsRNA is not the sole function of E3 needed for inhibition of PKR. This conclusion was supported by the fact that E3 activity was antagonized, not augmented, by overexpressing the catalytically defective PKR-K296R protein containing functional DRBMs. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that a majority of PKR in yeast extracts was in a complex with E3, whose formation was completely dependent on the dsRNA binding activity of E3 and enhanced by the N-terminal half of E3. In yeast two-hybrid assays and in vitro protein binding experiments, segments of E3 and PKR containing their respective DRBMs interacted in a manner requiring E3 residues Lys-167 and Arg-168. We also detected interactions between PKR and the N-terminal half of E3 in the yeast two-hybrid and lambda repressor dimerization assays. In the latter case, the N-terminal half of E3 interacted with the kinase domain of PKR, dependent on E3 residue Trp-66. We propose that effective inhibition of PKR in yeast requires formation of an E3-PKR-dsRNA complex, in which the N-terminal half of E3 physically interacts with the protein kinase domain of PKR."
10684300,"Hepatitis B virus X protein colocalizes to mitochondria with a human voltage-dependent anion channel, HVDAC3, and alters its transmembrane potential.","Understanding the mechanism(s) of action of the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded protein HBx is fundamental to elucidating the underlying mechanisms of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma caused by HBV infection. In our continued attempts to identify cellular targets of HBx, we have previously reported the identification of a novel cellular protein with the aid of a yeast two-hybrid assay. This cellular gene was identified as a third member of the family of human genes that encode the voltage-dependent anion channel (HVDAC3). In the present study, physical interaction between HBx and HVDAC3 was established by standard in vitro and in vivo methods. Confocal laser microscopy of transfected cells with respective expression vectors colocalized HVDAC3 and HBx to mitochondria. This novel, heretofore unreported subcellular distribution of HBx in mitochondria implies a functional role of HBx in functions associated with mitochondria. Using a stable cationic fluorophore dye, CMXRos, we show that HBx expression in cultured human hepatoma cells leads to alteration of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Such functional roles of HBx in affecting mitochondrial physiology have implications for HBV-induced liver injury and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma."
17428862,Induction of apoptosis by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 7a protein is dependent on its interaction with the Bcl-XL protein.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 7a protein, which is not expressed by other known coronaviruses, can induce apoptosis in various cell lines. In this study, we show that the overexpression of Bcl-XL, a prosurvival member of the Bcl-2 family, blocks 7a-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the mechanism for apoptosis induction by 7a is at the level of or upstream from the Bcl-2 family. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that 7a interacts with Bcl-XL and other prosurvival proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1) but not with the proapoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bid). A good correlation between the abilities of 7a deletion mutants to induce apoptosis and to interact with Bcl-XL was observed, suggesting that 7a triggers apoptosis by interfering directly with the prosurvival function of Bcl-XL. Interestingly, amino acids 224 and 225 within the C-terminal transmembrane domain of Bcl-XL are essential for the interaction with the 7a protein, although the BH3 domain of Bcl-XL also contributes to this interaction. In addition, fractionation experiments showed that 7a colocalized with Bcl-XL at the endoplasmic reticulum as well as the mitochondria, suggesting that they may form complexes in different membranous compartments."
12414957,Direct binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef to the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) cytoplasmic tail disrupts MHC-I trafficking.,"Nef, an essential pathogenic determinant for human immunodeficiency virus type 1, has multiple functions that include disruption of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHC-I) and CD4 and CD28 cell surface expression. The effects of Nef on MHC-I have been shown to protect infected cells from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte recognition by downmodulation of a subset of MHC-I (HLA-A and -B). The remaining HLA-C and -E molecules prevent recognition by natural killer (NK) cells, which would otherwise lyse cells expressing small amounts of MHC-I. Specific amino acid residues in the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail confer sensitivity to Nef, but their function is unknown. Here we show that purified Nef binds directly to the HLA-A2 cytoplasmic tail in vitro and that Nef forms complexes with MHC-I that can be isolated from human cells. The interaction between Nef and MHC-I appears to be weak, indicating that it may be transient or stabilized by other factors. Supporting the fact that these molecules interact in vivo, we found that Nef colocalizes with HLA-A2 molecules in a perinuclear distribution inside cells. In addition, we demonstrated that Nef fails to bind the HLA-E tail and also fails to bind HLA-A2 tails with deletions of amino acids necessary for MHC-I downmodulation. These data provide an explanation for differential downmodulation of MHC-I allotypes by Nef. In addition, they provide the first direct evidence indicating that Nef functions as an adaptor molecule able to link MHC-I to cellular trafficking proteins."
11160719,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef selectively associates with a catalytically active subpopulation of p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) independently of PAK2 binding to Nck or beta-PIX.,"We have recently identified the Nef-associated serine-threonine kinase (NAK) as the p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2). Here we have taken advantage of the possibility to manipulate the functional properties of NAK by transfecting PAK2 cDNA or its mutant derivatives in order to further characterize the Nef-NAK complex. To exclude the possibility that some Nef variants might interact with PAK1 instead of PAK2, we also examined the identity of NAK complexed with divergent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV-1 Nef proteins. All tested Nef proteins, including SF2, NL4-3, BH10, and HAN-2, associated with PAK2 but not with PAK1. By exchanging different regions between these two PAK proteins, the selective ability of PAK2 to associate with Nef could be mapped to the carboxy-terminal part of its regulatory domain. Binding of PAK2 with the adapter protein Nck or beta-PIX was found to be dispensable for the assembly of the Nef-PAK2 complex, whereas an intact Cdc42-Rac1 interactive binding motif was required. Most importantly, we found that NAK represented a distinct subpopulation of the total cellular PAK2 characterized by a high specific kinase activity. Thus, although only a small fraction of cellular PAK2 could be found in complex with Nef, NAK represented a major part of cellular PAK2 activity."
16177101,The Nef protein of HIV-1 induces loss of cell surface costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in APCs.,"The Nef protein of HIV-1 is essential for its pathogenicity and is known to down-regulate MHC expression on infected cell surfaces. We now show that Nef also redistributes the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 away from the cell surface in the human monocytic U937 cell line as well as in mouse macrophages and dendritic cells. Furthermore, HIV-1-infected U937 cells and human blood-derived macrophages show a similar loss of cell surface CD80 and CD86. Nef colocalizes with MHC class I (MHCI), CD80, and CD86 in intracellular compartments, and binds to both mouse and human CD80 and CD86. Some Nef mutants defective in MHCI down-modulation, including one from a clinical isolate, remain capable of down-modulating CD80 and CD86. Nef-mediated loss of surface CD80/CD86 is functionally significant, because it leads to compromised activation of naive T cells. This novel immunomodulatory role of Nef may be of potential importance in explaining the correlations of macrophage-tropism and Nef with HIV-1 pathogenicity and immune evasion."
2194290,A cDNA for a protein that interacts with the human immunodeficiency virus Tat transactivator.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tat protein (Tat) is a positive regulator of virus gene expression and replication. Biotinylated Tat was used as a probe to screen a lambda gt11 fusion protein library, and a complementary DNA encoding a protein that interacts with Tat was cloned. Expression of this protein, designated TBP-1 (for Tat binding protein-1), was observed in a variety of cell lines, with expression being highest in human cells. TBP-1 was localized predominantly in the nucleus, which is consistent with the nuclear localization of Tat. In cotransfection experiments, expression of TBP-1 was able to specifically suppress Tat-mediated transactivation. The strategy described may be useful for direct identification and cloning of genes encoding proteins that associate with other proteins to modulate their activity in a positive or negative fashion."
9742109,"Inhibition of PrKX, a novel protein kinase, and the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase PKA by the regulatory proteins of adeno-associated virus type 2.","Adeno-associated virus encodes four nonstructural proteins, which are known as Rep78, Rep68, Rep52, and Rep40. Expression of these nonstructural proteins affects cell growth and gene expression through processes that have not yet been characterized. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have demonstrated that a stable interaction occurs between the viral proteins Rep78 and Rep52 and the putative protein kinase PrKX, which is encoded on the X chromosome. The stability and specificity of the Rep-PrKX interaction were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of complexes assembled in vitro and in vivo. Overexpressed PrKX, which was purified from cos cells, was shown to phosphorylate a synthetic protein kinase A (PKA) substrate. However, this activity was dramatically inhibited by stoichiometric amounts of Rep52 and weakly inhibited with Rep68, which lacks the carboxy-terminal sequence contained in Rep52. Similarly, a stable interaction was observed with Rep78, which also contains the carboxy-terminal sequence of Rep52. A stable interaction and inhibition were also observed between Rep52 and the catalytic subunit of PKA. By using surface plasmon resonance and kinetic studies, Kis of approximately 300 and 167 nM were calculated for Rep52 with PKA and with PrKX, respectively. Thus, Rep52 but not Rep68 can significantly inhibit the trans- and autophosphorylation activities of these kinases. The biological effects of Rep78-specific inhibition of PKA-responsive genes are illustrated by the reduction of steady-state levels of cyclic AMP-responsive-element-binding protein and cyclin A protein."
8989432,Human plasmatic apolipoprotein H binds human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 proteins.,"Apolipoprotein H (apo H), isolated from human plasma albumin solution, was shown to capture HIV-1-related antigens from antigen-positive sera (HIV-1 AG+) of AIDS patients, by using HIV-1-specific polyclonal antibodies. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and ligand blot and dot assays, apo H was able to bind recombinant retroviral HIV antigens, especially Gag proteins p18 of HIV-1, p26 of HIV-2, and Env gp160 of HIV-1. Binding was shown to be pH and NaCl dependent, with an optimum at acidic pH and low ionic strength. Specificity was demonstrated by saturation of this binding and inhibition either by homologous competition or by specific antisera. Binding was also observed in cell line-harvested viral proteins. The mechanism of this apo H-polyspecific binding is discussed in relation to conformational changes due to the influence of lipids or detergents."
16135253,Hepatitis B virus X protein interacts with beta5 subunit of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein.,"To isolate cellular proteins interacting with hepatitis B virus X protein (HBX), from HepG2 cells infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV)."
12767938,Selection of peptides with affinity for the N-terminal domain of GATA-1: Identification of a potential interacting protein.,"As most transcription factors, GATA-1 activities are mediated by interactions with multiple proteins. Those identified so far associate with the zinc-finger domain and/or surrounding sequences. In contrast, no proteins interacting with the N-terminal domain have been identified although several evidences suggest its involvement in the control of hematopoiesis. In an attempt to identify proteins that interact with the N-terminal transactivation domain of GATA-1, a random phage peptide library was screened with recombinant GATA-1 protein and the sequence of a selected peptide was used for database protein sequence retrieval. We selected a set of peptides sharing the core sequence phi-B((2-3))-nu((2-4)) (where phi, B, and nu represent hydrophobic, basic, and neutral residues, respectively). Using the sequence of the most represented peptide (pep5) as query, we retrieved the HIV accessory protein Nef. We show that Nef binds GATA-1 and GATA-3 in vitro in virtue of its sequence homology with pep5."
10200597,Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear protein EBNA-3 interacts with the epsilon-subunit of the T-complex protein 1 chaperonin complex.,"To find cellular proteins that associate with EBNA-3 (also called EBNA-3A), one of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded growth transformation-associated nuclear proteins."
10777214,"Epstein-Barr virus encoded nuclear protein EBNA-3 binds XAP-2, a protein associated with Hepatitis B virus X antigen.","EBNA-3 (also called EBNA-3A) is one of the EBV encoded nuclear antigens that are necessary for B-cell transformation. EBNA-3 is known to target RBPs, nuclear proteins that also interacts with EBNA-2, EBNA-4 and EBNA-6. In order to identify additional EBNA-3 targets, an EBV-transformed human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened in the yeast two-hybrid system with N-terminus truncated EBNA-3 that cannot interact with RBP-Jkappa. A clone, encoding Xap-2 protein, a cellular partner of Hepatitis B virus X-antigen was isolated. This protein is also known as the p38 subunit of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor complex (ARA9). The specific binding to EBNA-3 was confirmed by showing that the GST-Xap-2 precipitated EBNA-3 from CV1 cells that were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing EBNA-3. Deletion of the C-terminus of Xap-2 eliminated the binding. Fusion with green fluorescent protein showed that Xap-2 is preferentially cytoplasmic but translocates to the nucleus upon expression of EBNA-3."
9586638,Nef interacts with the mu subunit of clathrin adaptor complexes and reveals a cryptic sorting signal in MHC I molecules.,"The surface expression of MHC I is reduced in HIV-infected cells. We show that the Nef protein affects the intracellular sorting of HLA-A and -B molecules. In the presence of Nef, these proteins accumulate in the Golgi and colocalize with clathrin-coated vesicles. MHC I modulation relies on a tyrosine-based sorting signal located in the cytoplasmic domain of HLA-A and -B heavy chains. This cryptic sorting signal becomes operative only in the presence of Nef. Nef interacts with the medium (mu) subunit of AP adaptor complexes involved in the recognition of tyrosine-based sorting signals, likely facilitating the connection between MHC I and the clathrin-dependent sorting machinery."
16140759,Inhibition of ubiquitination and stabilization of human ubiquitin E3 ligase PIRH2 by measles virus phosphoprotein.,"Using a C-terminal domain (PCT) of the measles virus (MV) phosphoprotein (P protein) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, a cDNA identical to the recently described human p53-induced-RING-H2 (hPIRH2) cDNA was isolated. A glutathione S-transferase-hPIRH2 fusion protein expressed in bacteria was able to pull down P protein when mixed with an extract from P-expressing HeLa cells in vitro, and myc-tagged hPIRH2 could be reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated with MV P protein from human cells. Additionally, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that hPIRH2-myc, MV P, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins form a ternary complex. The hPIRH2 binding site was mapped to the C-terminal X domain region of the P protein by using a yeast two-hybrid assay. The PCT binding site was mapped on hPIRH2 by using a novel yeast two-hybrid tagged PCR approach and by co-immunoprecipitation of hPIRH2 cysteine mutants and mouse/human PIRH2 chimeras. The hPIRH2 C terminus could mediate the interaction with MV P which was favored by the RING-H2 motif. When coexpressed with an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged hPIRH2 protein, MV P alone or in a complex with MV N was able to redistribute hPIRH2 to outside the nucleus, within intracellular aggregates. Finally, MV P efficiently stabilized hPIRH2-myc expression and prevented its ubiquitination in vivo but had no effect on the stability or ubiquitination of an alternative ubiquitin E3 ligase, Mdm2. Thus, MV P protein is the first protein from a pathogen that is able to specifically interact with and stabilize the ubiquitin E3 ligase hPIRH2 by preventing its ubiquitination."
9190894,Functional interaction of the HTLV-1 transactivator Tax with activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4).,"The Tax protein of the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus (HTLV) activates the expression of viral mRNA through a three 21 bp repeat enhancer located within the HTLV-1 LTR. Since Tax does not bind to the 21 bp DNA repeats directly, it has been speculated that Tax interacts with cellular protein(s) which mediate binding to the enhancer. We employed the yeast two hybrid system to identify host proteins that are potentially relevant to Tax transactivation. We identified a Tax binding protein encoded from a cDNA expression library derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes. The corresponding cDNA has sequence identity with a known transcription factor, activating factor-4 (ATF-4). ATF-4 also binds to GST-Tax fusion protein in vitro. Tax mutants that did not transactivate the HTLV-1 LTR also failed to bind ATF-4. The critical domain for Tax binding resides in a 85 amino acid stretch in the C-terminus of ATF-4, which contains the basic domain and leucine zipper. We further demonstrated that both full length and N-terminal truncated ATF-4 were able to enhance Tax transactivation. Thus, ATF-4 may act as an adapter between Tax and the TRE (Tax responsive element), and play an important role in Tax-mediated transactivation."
15614436,Human hepatitis B virus X protein promotes cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis through interacting with a serine protease Hepsin.,"The X protein of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) acts as an indirect transcriptional transactivator to regulate the expression of many viral and cellular genes as well as playing a critical role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. While the biological importance of HBx has been well established, the cellular and molecular bases of its function remain largely undefined. In this study, we isolated a new HBV field strain from a patient with chronic viral infection. The X protein encoded by this virus was used as a bait protein for screening a human liver cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system. Several cell proteins were identified as new HBx interacting partners, including a transmembrane serine protease, Hepsin. Direct interaction between HBx and Hepsin proteins was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays. HBx also co-localized with Hepsin in human cells as determined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The interaction between HBx and Hepsin protein appeared to play a role in both promoting cell proliferation and blocking apoptosis in human liver tumor cell and normal liver cell lines. In addition, the complex of HBx and Hepsin promoted the expression of HBeAg in Hep G2.2.1.5 cells indicating that the association of these two proteins stimulated viral replication."
9733879,"CREB-2, a cellular CRE-dependent transcription repressor, functions in association with Tax as an activator of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter.","The Tax protein of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been implicated in human T-cell immortalization. The primary function of Tax is to transcriptionally activate the HTLV-1 promoter, but Tax is also known to stimulate expression of cellular genes. It has been reported to associate with several transcription factors, as well as proteins not involved in transcription. To better characterize potential cellular targets of Tax present in infected cells, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid screening was performed with a cDNA library constructed from the HTLV-1-infected MT2 cell line. From this study, we found 158 positive clones representing seven different cDNAs. We focused our attention on the cDNA encoding the transcription factor CREB-2. CREB-2 is an unconventional member of the ATF/CREB family in that it lacks a protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site and has been reported to negatively regulate transcription from the cyclic AMP response element of the human enkephalin promoter. In this study, we demonstrate that CREB-2 cooperates with Tax to enhance viral transcription and that its basic-leucine zipper C-terminal domain is required for both in vitro and in vivo interactions with Tax. Our results confirm that the activation of the HTLV-1 promoter through Tax and factors of the ATF/CREB family is PKA independent."
15592516,HTLV-I Tax induces and associates with Crk-associated substrate lymphocyte type (Cas-L).,"Crk-associated substrate lymphocyte type (Cas-L) is a docking protein that is heavily tyrosine phosphorylated by the engagement of beta1 integrins in T cells. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the role of Cas-L in the pathophysiology of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Examination of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ATL patients as well as ATL-derived T cell lines showed an elevation of Cas-L in these cells. We showed that tyrosine phosphorylation as well as expression of Cas-L was markedly elevated through the induction of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) Tax in JPX-9 cells, with these cells showing marked motile behavior on the ligands for integrins. We next performed yeast two-hybrid screening of cDNA library from an HTLV-I-transformed T cell line, which resulted in the identification of Tax as a putative binding partner for Cas-L. Co-precipitation experiments revealed that the serine-rich region of Cas-L might serve as the binding site with the highest affinity for Tax. Co-localization study showed that Tax and Cas-L partly merged in the cytoplasm. Finally, we showed that exogenous Cas-L inhibited Tax-mediated transactivation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), while Tax-independent activation of NF-kappaB remained intact, hence indicating that Cas-L might specifically regulate Tax-NF-kappaB pathway."
12904574,Replication-initiator protein (UL9) of the herpes simplex virus 1 binds NFB42 and is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.,"The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a critical role in the degradation of short-lived and regulatory proteins in a variety of cellular processes. The F-box proteins are part of the ubiquitin-ligase complexes, which mediate ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of phosphorylated proteins. We previously identified NFB42, an F-box protein that is highly enriched in the nervous system, as a binding partner for the herpes simplex virus 1 UL9 protein, the viral replication-initiator protein, in a yeast two-hybrid screen. In the present work, we find that coexpression of NFB42 and UL9 genes in 293T cells leads to a significant decrease in the level of UL9 protein. Treatment with the 26S-proteasome inhibitor MG132 restores the UL9 protein to normal levels. We have observed also that the UL9 protein is polyubiquitinated in vivo and that the interaction between NFB42 and the UL9 protein is dependent upon phosphorylation of the UL9 protein. These results suggest that the interaction of the UL9 protein with NFB42 results in its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. They suggest further a mechanism by which latency of herpes simplex virus 1 can be established in neuronal cells."
11532000,Mutational analysis of the J recombination signal sequence binding protein (RBP-J)/Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) and RBP-J/Notch interaction.,"Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) and the Notch protein both function within the nucleus as transcriptional adaptor proteins. EBNA2 plays a key role during the immortalization of primary B-cells by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Notch proteins are involved in lymphomagenesis as well as in multiple cell fate decisions during tissue differentiation and development. Both, EBNA2 and Notch interact with the DNA binding protein RBP-J and thereby gain access to the promoter of their target genes. In order to identify regions within the J recombination signal sequence binding protein (RBP-J), that are relevant for either the Notch or the EBNA2 interaction, we have performed a mutational analysis of RBP-J. A library of RBP-J mutants was screened by a reverse two-hybrid system for alleles that fail to bind to either EBNA2 or Notch. The sequence analysis of these alleles reveals that a limited and particularly distinct number of amino-acid positions are relevant for either interaction only. Given the important role of RBP-J in B-cell immortalization, the EBNA2/RBP-J protein-protein interaction could be a candidate target for therapeutic intervention in EBV related diseases."
15371341,Identification of a novel telomerase repressor that interacts with the human papillomavirus type-16 E6/E6-AP complex.,"The critical immortalizing activity of the human papillomavirus (HPV) type-16 E6 oncoprotein is to induce expression of hTERT, the catalytic and rate-limiting subunit of telomerase. Additionally, E6 binds to a cellular protein called E6-associated protein (E6-AP) to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for proteasome-dependent degradation. Although telomerase induction and p53 degradation are separable and distinct functions of E6, binding of E6 to E6-AP strongly correlated with the induction of hTERT. Here, we demonstrate using shRNAs to reduce E6-AP expression that E6-AP is required for E6-mediated telomerase induction. A yeast two-hybrid screen to find new targets of the E6/E6-AP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex identified NFX1. Two isoforms of NFX1 were found: NFX1-123, which coactivated with c-Myc at the hTERT promoter, and NFX1-91, which repressed the hTERT promoter. NFX1-91 was highly ubiquitinated and destabilized in epithelial cells expressing E6. Furthermore, knockdown of NFX1-91 by shRNA resulted in derepression of the endogenous hTERT promoter and elevated levels of telomerase activity. We propose that the induction of telomerase by the HPV-16 E6/E6-AP complex involves targeting of NFX1-91, a newly identified repressor of telomerase, for ubiquitination and degradation."
10544125,The conserved core of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef is essential for association with Lck and for enhanced viral replication in T-lymphocytes.,"The Nef protein of the primate lentiviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), is a myristylated protein associated with increased viral replication and enhanced pathogenicity. Both the potentiation of T-lymphocyte activation and the enhanced serine-phosphorylation of HIV-1 capsid by Nef correlate with increased viral replication. We report the functional interactions of the Nef proteins with Src kinases. The Nef proteins from HIV-1 and SIV bind to Lck as well as Hck, Lyn, and Fyn. The SH3 and SH2 domains of Lck are sufficient for coprecipitation with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated Nef proteins. The conserved core region of HIV-1 Nef is essential for the interaction with Lck and is also important for enhanced HIV-1 replication in T-lymphocytes. In addition, we show that SIV and HIV-1 Nef proteins are differentially tyrosine-phosphorylated. The kinase-active Lck tyrosine-phosphorylates SIVmac239 Nef but does not phosphorylate HIV-1 Nef. These data suggest that the association of Nef and Lck is central to the enhanced viral replication of HIV-1 and SIV in T-lymphocytes."
11752170,"K15 protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is latently expressed and binds to HAX-1, a protein with antiapoptotic function.","The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (or human herpesvirus 8) open reading frame (ORF) K15 encodes a putative integral transmembrane protein in the same genomic location as latent membrane protein 2A of Epstein-Barr virus. Ectopic expression of K15 in cell lines revealed the presence of several different forms ranging in size from full length, approximately 50 kDa, to 17 kDa. Of these different species the 35- and 23-kDa forms were predominant. Mutational analysis of the initiator AUG indicated that translation initiation from this first AUG is required for K15 expression. Computational analysis indicates that the different forms detected may arise due to proteolytic cleavage at internal signal peptide sites. We show that K15 is latently expressed in KSHV-positive primary effusion lymphoma cell lines and in multicentric Castleman's disease. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified HAX-1 (HS1 associated protein X-1) as a binding partner to the C terminus of K15 and show that K15 interacts with cellular HAX-1 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, HAX-1 colocalizes with K15 in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. The function of HAX-1 is unknown, although the similarity of its sequence to those of Nip3 and Bcl-2 infers a role in the regulation of apoptosis. We show here that HAX-1 can form homodimers in vivo and is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis and therefore represents a new apoptosis regulatory protein. The putative functions of K15 with respect to its interaction with HAX-1 are discussed."
16928741,Latency-associated nuclear antigen of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus recruits uracil DNA glycosylase 2 at the terminal repeats and is important for latent persistence of the virus.,"Latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) of KSHV is expressed in all forms of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-mediated tumors and is important for TR-mediated replication and persistence of the virus. LANA does not exhibit any enzymatic activity by itself but is critical for replication and maintenance of the viral genome. To identify LANA binding proteins, we used a LANA binding sequence 1 DNA affinity column and determined the identities of a number of proteins associated with LANA. One of the identified proteins was uracil DNA glycosylase 2 (UNG2). UNG2 is important for removing uracil residues yielded after either misincorporation of dUTP during replication or deamination of cytosine. The specificity of the 'LANA-UNG2 interaction was confirmed by using a scrambled DNA sequence affinity column. Interaction of LANA and UNG2 was further confirmed by in vitro binding and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Colocalization of these proteins was also detected in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells, as well as in a cotransfected KSHV-negative cell line. UNG2 binds to the carboxyl terminus of LANA and retains its enzymatic activity in the complex. However, no major effect on TR-mediated DNA replication was observed when a UNG2-deficient (UNG(-/-)) cell line was used. Infection of UNG(-/-) and wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts with KSHV did not reveal any difference; however, UNG(-/-) cells produced a significantly reduced number of virion particles after induction. Interestingly, depletion of UNG2 in PEL cells with short hairpin RNA reduced the number of viral genome copies and produced infection-deficient virus."
8700889,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and 2 Tat proteins specifically interact with RNA polymerase II.,"The Tat-responsive region (TAR) element is a critical RNA regulatory element in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat, which is required for activation of gene expression by the transactivator protein Tat. Recently, we demonstrated by gel-retardation analysis that RNA polymerase II binds to TAR RNA and that Tat prevents this binding even when Tat does not bind to TAR RNA. These results suggested that direct interactions between Tat and RNA polymerase II may prevent RNA polymerase II pausing and lead to Tat-mediated increases in transcriptional elongation. To test this possibility, we performed protein interaction studies with RNA polymerase II and both the HIV-1 and the closely related HIV-2 Tat protein. These studies indicated that both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins could specifically interact with RNA polymerase II. Mutagenesis of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat demonstrated that the basic domains of both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins were required for this interaction. Furthermore, ""far Western"" analysis suggested that the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II was the site for interaction with Tat. The interactions between Tat and RNA polymerase II were of similar magnitude to those detected between RNA polymerase II and the cellular transcription factor RAP30, which stably associates with RNA polymerase II during transcriptional elongation. These studies are consistent with the model that RNA polymerase II is a cellular target for Tat resulting in Tat-mediated increases in transcriptional elongation from the HIV long terminal repeat."
15099524,Mutual functional destruction of HIV-1 Vpu and host TASK-1 channel.,"Sequence analysis predicted significant structural homology between the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu and the N-terminal region of TASK-1, a mammalian background K(+) channel. If the homology resulted from molecular piracy during HIV-1 evolution, these two proteins may have important functional interactions. Here we demonstrate that TASK and Vpu physically interact in cultured cells and in AIDS lymphoid tissues. The functional consequences were potentially destructive for both components: Vpu abolished TASK-1 current, while overexpressing TASK led to a marked impairment of Vpu's ability to enhance viral particle release. Further, the first 40 amino acids of TASK-1 (part of the homology to Vpu) were capable of enhancing HIV-1 particle release. This virus-host interaction may influence HIV-1/AIDS progression, as well as electrical signaling in infected host tissues."
8943069,Activation of the JC virus Tat-responsive transcriptional control element by association of the Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus 1 with cellular protein Pur alpha.,"JC virus is activated to replicate in glial cells of many AIDS patients with neurological disorders. In human glial cells, the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein activates the major late promoter of JC virus through a Tat-responsive DNA element, termed upTAR, which is a recognition site for cellular Pur alpha, a sequence-specific single-stranded DNA binding protein implicated in cell cycle control of DNA replication and transcription. Tat interacts with two leucine-rich repeats in Pur alpha to form a complex that can be immunoprecipitated from cell extracts. Tat enhances the ability of purified glutathione S-transferase-Pur alpha (GST-Pur alpha) to bind the upTAR element. Tat acts synergistically with Pur alpha, in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, to activate transcription at an upTAR element placed upstream of a heterologous promoter. Since Pur alpha is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and since PUR elements are located near many promoters and origins of replication, the Tat-Pur alpha interaction may be implicated in effects of HIV-1 throughout the full range of HIV-1-infected cells."
10388655,The human papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein abrogates signaling mediated by interferon-alpha.,"Greater than 95% of all cervical carcinomas have been found to be associated with ""high-risk"" human papillomavirus (mainly types 16 and 18) infections, with the viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins essential for neoplastic development and maintenance. Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) is used in the treatment of HPV infections yet both in vivo and in vitro data suggest that the virus has developed mechanisms to avoid the effects of interferon. Here we show that the HPV16 E7 oncoprotein is able to inhibit the induction of IFNalpha-inducible genes but has no effect of IFNgamma-inducible genes. Expression of E7 correlates with the loss of formation of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcription complex. Moreover, in the presence of E7, p48, the DNA-binding component of ISGF3, was unable to translocate to the nucleus upon IFNalpha stimulation. A direct protein-protein interaction was identified between E7 and p48 with the site of interaction within E7 defined as the region between amino acids 17-37, a domain that includes the binding site for the retinoblastoma protein, pRb. These results suggest that HPV, via E7, targets p48, resulting in the loss of IFNalpha-mediated signal transduction and may provide a means by which HPV can avoid the innate immune system."
9075929,The N-terminus of Nef from HIV-1/SIV associates with a protein complex containing Lck and a serine kinase.,"The Nef protein of human and primate lentiviruses is a key factor in HIV/SIV pathogenesis. Here we report that Nef associates with two different kinases, forming a multiprotein complex at the far N-terminus of the viral protein. One of the kinases was identified as Lck, whereas the second protein was found to be a serine kinase that phosphorylated Nef and Lck in vitro and could be discriminated from the serine kinase identified previously. The Nef-associated kinase complex (NAKC) was demonstrated in COS cells, in HIV-infected cells, and in vitro using recombinant Lck and Nef proteins. Deletion of a short amphipathic alpha-helix in the N-terminus, which was found to be conserved in all Nef proteins, inhibited association of the NAKC and significantly reduced virion infectivity."
12716886,Structural basis for variation in adenovirus affinity for the cellular coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor.,"The majority of adenovirus serotypes can bind to the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) on human cells despite only limited conservation of the amino acid residues that comprise the receptor-binding sites of these viruses. Using a fluorescence anisotropy-based assay, we determined that the recombinant knob domain of the fiber protein from adenovirus serotype (Ad) 2 binds the soluble, N-terminal domain (domain 1 (D1)) of CAR with 8-fold greater affinity than does the recombinant knob domain from Ad12. Homology modeling predicted that the increased affinity of Ad2 knob for CAR D1 could result from additional contacts within the binding interface contributed by two residues, Ser408 and Tyr477, which are not conserved in the Ad12 knob. Consistent with this structural model, substitution of serine and tyrosine for the corresponding residues in the Ad12 knob (P417S and S489Y) increased the binding affinity by 4- and 8-fold, respectively, whereas the double mutation increased binding affinity 10-fold. X-ray structure analysis of Ad12 knob mutants P417S and S489Y indicated that both substituted residues potentially could form additional hydrogen bonds across the knob-CAR interface. Structural changes resulting from these mutations were highly localized, implying that the high tolerance for surface variation conferred by the stable knob scaffold can minimize the impact of antigenic drift on binding specificity and affinity during evolution of virus serotypes. Our results suggest that the interaction of knob domains from different adenovirus serotypes with CAR D1 can be accurately modeled using the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 crystal structure as a template."
10660579,HIV-2 and SIV nef proteins target different Src family SH3 domains than does HIV-1 Nef because of a triple amino acid substitution.,"The nef gene is required for optimal viral spread of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of the Nef proteins may not be identical for all viral families. Here we investigate the interaction between the Nef protein of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses and SH3 domains from Src family kinases. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoblotting we show that, in contrast to HIV-1 Nef, SIV and HIV-2 Nef poorly interact with Hck SH3 but bind to Src and Fyn SH3 domains. The molecular basis of these differences in SH3 targeting was revealed by sequence analysis and homology modeling of the putative SH3-Nef structures. Three amino acids (Trp-113, Thr-117, and Gln-118) that localize in a ""hydrophobic pocket"" implicated in SH3 binding of HIV-1 Nef, are systematically substituted in SIV/HIV-2 alleles (by Tyr, Glu, and Glu, respectively). We demonstrate that site-directed mutagenesis of these residues in SIV(mac239) Nef suffices to restore Hck SH3 binding and co-immunoprecipitation with full-length Hck from transfected cells. Our findings identify fundamental mechanistic differences in targeting of Src family kinases by HIV and SIV Nef. The herein described mechanism of SH3 selection by Nef via a ""pocket"" proximal to the canonical proline-rich motif may be a common feature for SH3 recognition by their natural ligands."
10799608,Mutation of a conserved residue (D123) required for oligomerization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein abolishes interaction with human thioesterase and results in impairment of Nef biological functions.,"Nef is a myristoylated protein of 27 to 35 kDa that is conserved in primate lentiviruses. In vivo, Nef is required for high viral load and full pathological effects. In vitro, Nef has at least four activities: induction of CD4 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I downregulation, enhancement of viral infectivity, and alteration of T-cell activation pathways. We previously reported that the Nef protein from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 interacts with a novel human thioesterase (hTE). In the present study, by mutational analysis, we identified a region of the Nef core, extending from the residues D108 to W124, that is involved both in Nef-hTE interaction and in Nef-induced CD4 downregulation. This region of Nef is located on the oligomer interface and is in close proximity to the putative CD4 binding site. One of the mutants carrying a mutation in this region, targeted to the conserved residue D123, was also found to be defective in two other functions of Nef, MHC class I downmodulation and enhancement of viral infectivity. Furthermore, mutation of this residue affected the ability of Nef to form dimers, suggesting that the oligomerization of Nef may be critical for its multiple functions."
7954800,Adenovirus E1B 19 kDa and Bcl-2 proteins interact with a common set of cellular proteins.,"Adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein protects against cell death induced by viral infection and certain external stimuli. The Bcl-2 protein can functionally substitute for the E1B 19 kDa protein. To identify cellular targets for the 19 kDa protein, we used the two-hybrid screen in yeast. We have isolated cDNAs for three different proteins, designated Nip1, Nip2, and Nip3, that interact with the 19 kDa protein. Mutational analysis indicates that these proteins do not associate with 19 kDa mutants defective in suppression of cell death, suggesting a correlation between interaction of these proteins and suppression of cell death. These proteins also associate with discrete sequence motifs in the Bcl-2 protein that are homologous to motifs of the 19 kDa protein. Our results suggest that two diverse proteins, the E1B 19 kDa and the Bcl-2 proteins, promote cell survival through interaction with a common set of cellular proteins."
12457967,Novel cellular interacting partners of the human papillomavirus 16 transcription/replication factor E2.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are causative agents in a number of human diseases. HPV can be divided into two groups: low risk that cause diseases such as genital warts, and high risk that cause ano-genital cancers. Of the high-risk group, HPV16 is the most commonly found in cervical cancer. All HPV encode an E2 protein and this protein regulates transcription from, and replication of, the viral genome making it essential for the viral life cycle. In order to function E2 must interact with cellular proteins; identification of these cellular partners will provide targets for disruption of the viral life cycle and will also provide insights into the processes of transcription and replication. To identify the cellular interacting partners for HPV16 E2, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen with the amino-terminus of E2 that is essential for mediating transcription and replication. Here we describe how this screen was carried out and detail the interacting partners that were identified; these include the proteins TopBP1, RACK1, POMP, p27(BBP), ODC antizyme, and Delta-adaptin. Several of these partners have characteristics that make them ideal candidates for mediating E2 function."
9620685,Interactions between HIV1 Nef and vacuolar ATPase facilitate the internalization of CD4.,"CD4 is the primary receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Nef is an accessory protein of HIV that decreases the expression of CD4 on the surface of infected cells. In this study, we identified the Nef binding protein 1 (NBP1), which interacts specifically with Nef in vitro and in vivo. Since it shares sequence similarity with the catalytic subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and complements the loss of this VMA13 gene in yeast, NBP1 is the human homolog of Vma13p. Direct interactions between Nef and NBP1 were correlated with the ability of Nef to internalize CD4. The expression of the antisense NBP1 abrogated these effects. We conclude that NBP1 helps to connect Nef with the endocytic pathway."
11172044,Herpes simplex virus 1 alpha regulatory protein ICP0 functionally interacts with cellular transcription factor BMAL1.,"The infected cell protein no. 0 (ICP0) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a promiscuous transactivator shown to enhance the expression of gene introduced into cells by infection or transfection. At the molecular level, ICP0 is a 775-aa ring finger protein localized initially in the nucleus and late in infection in the cytoplasm and mediates the degradation of several proteins and stabilization of others. None of the known functions at the molecular level account for the apparent activity of ICP0 as a transactivator. Here we report that ICP0 functionally interacts with cellular transcription factor BMAL1, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) super family of transcriptional regulators. Specifically, sequences mapped to the exon II of ICP0 interacted with BMAL1 in the yeast two-hybrid system and in reciprocal pull-down experiments in vitro. Moreover, the enhancement of transcription of a luciferase reporter construct whose promoter contained multiple BMAL1-binding sites by ICP0 and BMAL1 was significantly greater than that observed by ICP0 or BMAL1 alone. Although the level of BMAL1 present in nuclei of infected cells remained unchanged between 3 and 8 h after infection, the level of cytoplasmic BMAL1 was reduced at 8 h after infection. The reduction of cytoplasmic BMAL1 was significantly greater in cells infected with the ICP0-null mutant than in the wild-type virus-infected cells, suggesting that ICP0 mediates partial stabilization of the protein. These results indicate that ICP0 interacts physically and functionally with at least one cellular transcription-regulatory factor."
8995621,Interaction of herpes simplex virus 1 alpha regulatory protein ICP0 with elongation factor 1delta: ICP0 affects translational machinery.,"The herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) is a promiscuous transactivator, and by necessity, its functions must be mediated through cellular gene products. In an attempt to identify cellular factors interacting with ICP0, we used the carboxyl-terminal domain of ICP0 as ""bait"" in the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid system. Our results were as follows: (i) All 43 cDNAs in positive yeast colonies were found to encode the same translation factor, elongation factor delta-1 (EF-1delta). (ii) Purified chimeric protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to EF-1delta specifically formed complexes with ICP0 contained in HSV-1-infected cell lysate. (iii) Fractionation of infected HEp-2 cells and immunofluorescence studies revealed that ICP0 was localized both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. In primary human foreskin fibroblasts, ICP0 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm throughout HSV-1 infection even early in infection. (iv) Addition of the chimeric protein GST-carboxyl-terminal domain of ICP0 to the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in protein synthesis. In contrast, GST alone or GST fused to the amino-terminal domain of ICP0 had no effect on the in vitro translation system. (v) The predominant forms of EF-1delta on electrophoresis in denaturing gels have apparent Mrs of 38,000 and 40,000. The higher-Mr form is a minor species in mock-infected cells, whereas in human fibroblasts and Vero cells infected with HSV-1, this isoform becomes dominant. These results indicate that ICP0 is present and may have a significant role in the cytoplasm of infected cells, possibly by altering the efficiency of translation of viral mRNAs."
12388711,Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus mitochondrial K7 protein targets a cellular calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand to modulate intracellular calcium concentration and inhibit apoptosis.,"On viral infection, infected cells can become the target of host immune responses or can go through a programmed cell death process, called apoptosis, as a defense mechanism to limit the ability of the virus to replicate. To prevent this, viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to subvert the apoptotic process. Here, we report the identification of a novel antiapoptotic K7 protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) which expresses during lytic replication. The KSHV K7 gene encodes a small mitochondrial membrane protein, and its expression efficiently inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of apoptogenic agents. The yeast two-hybrid screen has demonstrated that K7 targets cellular calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML), a protein that regulates the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. Similar to CAML, K7 expression significantly enhances the kinetics and amplitudes of the increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration on apoptotic stimulus. Mutational analysis showed that K7 interaction with CAML is required for its function in the inhibition of apoptosis. This indicates that K7 targets cellular CAML to increase the cytosolic Ca(2+) response, which consequently protects cells from mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. This is a novel viral antiapoptosis strategy where the KSHV mitochondrial K7 protein targets a cellular Ca(2+)-modulating protein to confer resistance to apoptosis, which allows completion of the viral lytic replication and, eventually, maintenance of persistent infection in infected host."
17315751,[Recent research on the JC virus].,"JC virus (JCV) is a causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and belongs to Polyomavirus. In this article we describe our recent research relating to this virus. First, JCV's major capsid protein VP1 possesses a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and has the ability to construct a virus-like particle (VLP). We have investigated the mechanism of nuclear entry of JCV using VLP, and clarified the role of NLS. In vitro transport assay revealed that wild type VLP (wtVLP), but not deltaNLSVLP, entered the nuclei of cells. The nuclear transport of wtVLP was dependent on the addition of importins alpha and beta and was prevented by antibodies to nuclear pore complex (NPC). These results suggested that JCV VLP binds to cellular importins via the NLS of VP1 and is transported into the nucleus through the NPC. Second, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library demonstrated that the fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1 (FEZ1) and the heterochromatin protein lalpha (HPla) are proteins that interacted with JCV agnoprotein (Agno). In vitro binding assay showed that Agno interacts directly with FEZ1 and HPlalpha. We have also shown that Agno induces the dissociation of FEZ1 from microtubules and dissociates the interaction between HPlalpha and lamin B receptor. We have demonstrated that interaction between Agno and these host proteins inhibited nuclear egress of JCV. Third, in order to inhibit JCV infection in infected cells, we synthesized siRNA which is specific for JCV Agno. Immunoblotting and immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that expression levels of agnoprotein and VP1 were significantly inhibited by specific siRNA. In addition, levels of viral mRNAs and viral production were decreased in the cells transfected with Agno siRNA. Furthermore, viral production of cell treated with Agno siRNA was significantly inhibited. These results indicate that post-infection treatment with siRNAs, that targets JCV Agno suppresses virus production in JCV infected cells. Thus, siRNA directed against JCV encoding genes may provide a useful tool for suppression of JCV infection."
16923959,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr induces G2 checkpoint activation by interacting with the splicing factor SAP145.,"Vpr, the viral protein R of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, induces G(2) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in mammalian cells via ATR (for ""ataxia-telangiectasia-mediated and Rad3-related"") checkpoint activation. The expression of Vpr induces the formation of the gamma-histone 2A variant X (H2AX) and breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1) nuclear foci, and a C-terminal domain is required for Vpr-induced ATR activation and its nuclear localization. However, the cellular target of Vpr, as well as the mechanism of G(2) checkpoint activation, was unknown. Here we report that Vpr induces checkpoint activation and G(2) arrest by binding to the CUS1 domain of SAP145 and interfering with the functions of the SAP145 and SAP49 proteins, two subunits of the multimeric splicing factor 3b (SF3b). Vpr interacts with and colocalizes with SAP145 through its C-terminal domain in a speckled distribution. The depletion of either SAP145 or SAP49 leads to checkpoint-mediated G(2) cell cycle arrest through the induction of nuclear foci containing gamma-H2AX and BRCA1. In addition, the expression of Vpr excludes SAP49 from the nuclear speckles and inhibits the formation of the SAP145-SAP49 complex. To conclude, these results point out the unexpected roles of the SAP145-SAP49 splicing factors in cell cycle progression and suggest that cellular expression of Vpr induces checkpoint activation and G(2) arrest by interfering with the function of SAP145-SAP49 complex in host cells."
11581395,mRNA decay during herpesvirus infections: interaction between a putative viral nuclease and a cellular translation factor.,"During lytic infections, the virion host shutoff (Vhs) protein (UL41) of herpes simplex virus destabilizes both host and viral mRNAs. By accelerating mRNA decay, it helps determine the levels and kinetics of viral and cellular gene expression. In vivo, Vhs shows a strong preference for mRNAs, as opposed to non-mRNAs, and degrades the 5' end of mRNAs prior to the 3' end. In contrast, partially purified Vhs is not restricted to mRNAs and causes cleavage of target RNAs at various sites throughout the molecule. To explain this discrepancy, we searched for cellular proteins that interact with Vhs using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid system. Vhs was found to interact with the human translation initiation factor, eIF4H. This interaction was verified by glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments and by coimmunoprecipitation of Vhs and epitope-tagged eIF4H from extracts of mammalian cells. The interaction was abolished by several point mutations in Vhs that abrogate its ability to degrade mRNAs in vivo. The results suggest that Vhs is a viral mRNA degradation factor that is targeted to mRNAs, and to regions of translation initiation, through an interaction with eIF4H."
11070032,Interaction between herpes simplex virus type 1 IE63 protein and cellular protein p32.,"The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) immediate-early gene IE63 (ICP27), the only HSV-1 regulatory gene with a homologue in every mammalian and avian herpesvirus sequenced so far, is a multifunctional protein which regulates transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes. One of its posttranscriptional effects is the inhibition of splicing of viral and cellular transcripts. We previously identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K and casein kinase 2 (CK2) as two protein partners of IE63 (H. Bryant et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:28991-28998, 1999). Here, using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we identify another partner of IE63, the cellular protein p32. Confirmation of this interaction was provided by coimmunoprecipitation from virus-infected cells and recombinant p32 binding assays. A p32-hnRNP K-CK2 complex, which required IE63 to form, was isolated from HSV-1-infected cells, and coimmunoprecipitating p32 was phosphorylated by CK2. Expression of IE63 altered the cytoplasmic distribution of p32, with some now colocalizing with IE63 in the nuclei of infected and transfected cells. As p32 copurifies with splicing factors and can inhibit splicing, we propose that IE63 together with p32, possibly with other IE63 partner proteins, acts to disrupt or regulate pre-mRNA splicing. As well as contributing to host cell shutoff, this effect could facilitate splicing-independent nuclear export of viral transcripts."
14557668,Hendra virus V protein inhibits interferon signaling by preventing STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear accumulation.,"The V protein of the recently emerged paramyxovirus, Nipah virus, has been shown to inhibit interferon (IFN) signal transduction through cytoplasmic sequestration of cellular STAT1 and STAT2 in high-molecular-weight complexes. Here we demonstrate that the closely related Hendra virus V protein also inhibits cellular responses to IFN through binding and cytoplasmic sequestration of both STAT1 and STAT2, but not STAT3. These findings demonstrate a V protein-mediated IFN signal evasion mechanism that is a general property of the known Henipavirus species."
17055456,The interaction of hepatitis B virus X protein and protein phosphatase type 2 Calpha and its effect on IL-6.,"HBx has been suggested as an important determinant mediating the pathological effects of HBV via interacting with various cellular proteins. To identify new HBx-interacting proteins and elucidate a possible mechanism associated with HBx and HBx-interacting proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed. We identified a novel HBx-interacting protein, serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2Calpha, and investigated the effects of PP2Calpha on HBx-mediated IL-6 regulation. The interaction between endogenous PP2Calpha, and HBx was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Recombinant HBx dose-dependently reduced enzyme activity of recombinant PP2Calphain vitro. While ectopically expressed PP2Calpha in Cos-7 and Huh-7 cells reduced the expression of IL-6, overexpressed HBx with recombinant HBx-expressing adenovirus overcame PP2Calpha-mediated IL-6 downregulation. In the response of IL-6, HBx phosphorylated STAT3 and recovered PP2Calpha-mediated dephosphorylation of STAT3. These results supported that HBx might play a crucial role in HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis even in cases where cells express a negative regulator, PP2Calpha."
18069888,A novel inhibitory mechanism of mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis by a herpesviral protein.,"Upon viral infection, cells undergo apoptosis as a defense against viral replication. Viruses, in turn, have evolved elaborate mechanisms to subvert apoptotic processes. Here, we report that a novel viral mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein (vMAP) of murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (gammaHV-68) interacts with Bcl-2 and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) in a genetically separable manner. The N-terminal region of vMAP interacted with Bcl-2, and this interaction markedly increased not only Bcl-2 recruitment to mitochondria but also its avidity for BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins, thereby suppressing Bax mitochondrial translocation and activation. In addition, the central and C-terminal hydrophobic regions of vMAP interacted with VDAC1. Consequently, these interactions resulted in the effective inhibition of cytochrome c release, leading to the comprehensive inhibition of mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis. Finally, vMAP gene was required for efficient gammaHV-68 lytic replication in normal cells, but not in mitochondrial apoptosis-deficient cells. These results demonstrate that gammaHV-68 vMAP independently targets two important regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis-mediated intracellular innate immunity, allowing efficient viral lytic replication."
11956210,Tat acetyl-acceptor lysines are important for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 replication.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type-1 trans-activator Tat is a transcription factor that activates the HIV-1 promoter through binding to the trans-activation-responsive region (TAR) localized at the 5'-end of all viral transcripts. We and others have recently shown that Tat is directly acetylated at lysine 28, within the activation domain, and lysine 50, in the TAR RNA binding domain, by Tat-associated histone acetyltransferases p300, p300/CBP-associating factor, and hGCN5. Here, we show that mutation of acetyl-acceptor lysines to arginine or glutamine affects virus replication. Interestingly, mutation of lysine 28 and lysine 50 differentially affected Tat trans-activation of integrated versus nonintegrated long terminal repeat. Our results highlight the importance of lysine 28 and lysine 50 of Tat in virus replication and Tat-mediated trans-activation."
15795250,"Inhibition of Epstein-Barr virus OriP function by tankyrase, a telomere-associated poly-ADP ribose polymerase that binds and modifies EBNA1.","Tankyrase (TNKS) is a telomere-associated poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) that has been implicated along with several telomere repeat binding factors in the regulation of Epstein-Barr virus origin of plasmid replication (OriP). We now show that TNKS1 can bind to the family of repeats (FR) and dyad symmetry regions of OriP by using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and DNA affinity purification. TNKS1 and TNKS2 bound to EBNA1 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments with transfected cell lysates and with purified recombinant proteins in vitro. Two RXXPDG-like TNKS-interacting motifs in the EBNA1 amino-terminal domain mediated binding with the ankyrin repeat domain of TNKS. Mutations of both motifs at EBNA1 G81 and G425 abrogated TNKS binding and enhanced EBNA1-dependent replication of OriP. Small hairpin RNA targeted knock-down of TNKS1 enhanced OriP-dependent DNA replication. Overexpression of TNKS1 or TNKS2 inhibited OriP-dependent DNA replication, while a PARP-inactive form of TNKS2 (M1045V) was compromised for this inhibition. We show that EBNA1 is subject to PAR modification in vivo and to TNKS1-mediated PAR modification in vitro. These results indicate that TNKS proteins can interact directly with the EBNA1 protein, associate with the FR region of OriP in vivo, and inhibit OriP replication in a PARP-dependent manner."
12032084,Transcriptional synergy between Tat and PCAF is dependent on the binding of acetylated Tat to the PCAF bromodomain.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Tat protein plays an essential role in promoting efficient transcriptional elongation of viral transcripts. We report that the transcriptional co-activator PCAF and Tat interact and synergize to activate the HIV promoter. The binding of Tat and PCAF in vitro and in vivo is dependent on the acetylated state of Lys50 of Tat and on the PCAF bromodomain. Structural analysis of the acetylated Tat peptide bound to the PCAF bromodomain defined amino acids Y47 and R53 in Tat and V763, Y802, and Y809 in PCAF as critical interaction points between the two proteins. Mutation of each of these residues in either Tat or PCAF inhibited in a cumulative manner the Tat-PCAF interaction in vitro and in vivo, and abrogated the synergistic activation of the HIV promoter by both proteins. These observations demonstrate that acetylation of Tat establishes a novel protein-protein interaction domain at the surface of Tat that is necessary for the transcriptional activation of the HIV promoter."
9632134,Cytoplasmic displacement of cyclin E-cdk2 inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 in anchorage-independent cells.,"Loss of attachment to an extracellular matrix substrate arrests the growth of untransformed cells in the G1 phase. This anchorage-dependent cell cycle arrest is linked to increased expression of the p21Cip1 (p21) and p27Kip1 (p27) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The result is a loss of cdk2-associated kinase activity, especially that of cyclin E-cdk2. The levels of p21 and p27 are also upregulated in unattached transformed cells, but cyclin E-cdk2 activity remains high, and the cells are able to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Increased expression of cyclin E and cdk2 appears to be partially responsible for the maintenance of cyclin E-cdk2 activity in transformed cells. To explore further the regulation of cyclin E-cdk2 in transformed cells, we have analysed the subcellular distribution of cyclin-cdk complexes and their inhibitors in normal human fibroblasts, their transformed counterparts, and in various human tumor cell lines. In substrate-attached normal fibroblasts, cyclin E and cdk2 were exclusively in the nuclear fraction, associated with one another. When normal fibroblasts were detached and held in suspension, cyclin E-cdk2 complexes remained nuclear, but were now found associated with the p21 and p27 cdk inhibitors and lacked histone H1 phosphorylating activity. In contrast, the transformed fibroblasts and tumor cells, which are anchorage-independent, had more than half of their cyclin E, cdk2, p21 and p27 in the cytoplasmic fraction, both in attached and suspended cultures. The cytoplasmic p21 and p27 were bound to cyclin E-cdk2, as well as to complexes containing cyclin A and cyclin D. The nuclear cyclin E-cdk2 complexes from the transformed cells grown in suspension contained only low levels of p21 and p27 and had histone H1 kinase activity. Thus, at least three mechanisms contribute to keeping cyclin E-cdk2 complexes active in suspended anchorage-independent cells: cyclin E and cdk2 are upregulated, as reported previously, cdk inhibitors are sequestered away from the nucleus by cytoplasmic cyclin-cdk complexes, and the binding of the inhibitors to nuclear cyclin E-cdk2 complexes is impaired."
16410799,The TRAF3-binding site of human molluscipox virus FLIP molecule MC159 is critical for its capacity to inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis.,"Members of the viral Flice/caspase-8 inhibitory protein (v-FLIP) family prevent induction of apoptosis by death receptors through inhibition of the processing and activation of procaspase-8 and -10 at the level of the receptor-associated death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Here, we have addressed the molecular function of the v-FLIP member MC159 of the human molluscum contagiosum virus. MC159 FLIP powerfully inhibited both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death induced by Fas. The C-terminal region of MC159 bound TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)3, was necessary for optimal TRAF2 binding, and mediated the recruitment of both TRAFs into the Fas DISC. TRAF-binding-deficient mutants of MC159 showed impaired inhibition of FasL-induced caspase-8 processing and Fas internalization, and had reduced antiapoptotic activity. Our findings provide evidence that a MC159/TRAF2/TRAF3 complex regulates a new aspect of Fas signaling, and identify MC159 FLIP as a molecule that targets multiple features of Fas-induced cell death."
16179353,Heat shock protein 40 is necessary for human immunodeficiency virus-1 Nef-mediated enhancement of viral gene expression and replication.,"The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Nef protein, originally identified as a negative factor, has now emerged as one of the most important viral proteins necessary for viral pathogenesis and disease progression. Nef has been also implicated in viral infectivity and replication, however, the molecular mechanism of Nef-induced viral gene expression and replication is not clearly understood. Although involvement of heat shock proteins in viral pathogenesis has been reported earlier, a clear understanding of their role remains to be elucidated. Here we report for the first time that Nef not only interacts with heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) but it also induces the expression of Hsp40 in HIV-1-infected cells. The interaction between Nef and Hsp40 is important for increased Hsp40 translocation into the nucleus of infected cells, which seems to facilitate viral gene expression by becoming part of the cyclin-dependent kinase 9-associated transcription complex regulating long terminal repeat-mediated gene expression. The finding is consistent with the failure of the nef-deleted virus to induce Hsp40, resulting in reduced virus production. Our data further shows that, whereas, Hsp40 overexpression induces viral gene expression, silencing of Hsp40 reduces the gene expression in a Nef-dependent manner. Thus our results clearly indicate that Hsp40 is crucial for Nef-mediated enhancement of viral gene expression and replication."
16998888,"SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein binds to hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation system.","SARS-CoV is a newly identified coronavirus (CoV) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is an important structural and functional protein. To identify cellular proteins that interact with the SARS-CoV N protein and to elucidate the possible involvement of N protein in SARS-CoV pathogenesis, a human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened using a yeast two-hybrid system assay. hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of sumoylation system, was found to interact specifically with the N protein, implying the post-translational sumoylation of the N protein. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acids 170-210, which includes the SR-rich motif. However, the consensus motif of sumoylation GK(62)EE in the N protein is not responsible for binding to hUbc9. Mutations of hUbc9 at the enzyme active site C93A or C93S severely impair the interaction with the N protein. The two proteins were also shown to colocalize in the cytoplasm of the transfected 293T cells. This is the first report demonstrating the interaction of hUbc9 with a structural protein of plus-strand RNA viruses, indicating a new drug target for SARS-CoV."
11027346,Selective CXCR4 antagonism by Tat: implications for in vivo expansion of coreceptor use by HIV-1.,"Chemokines and chemokine receptors play important roles in HIV-1 infection and tropism. CCR5 is the major macrophage-tropic coreceptor for HIV-1 whereas CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) serves the counterpart function for T cell-tropic viruses. An outstanding biological mystery is why only R5-HIV-1 is initially detected in new seroconvertors who are exposed to R5 and X4 viruses. Indeed, X4 virus emerges in a minority of patients and only in the late stage of disease, suggesting that early negative selection against HIV-1-CXCR4 interaction may exist. Here, we report that the HIV-1 Tat protein, which is secreted from virus-infected cells, is a CXCR4-specific antagonist. Soluble Tat selectively inhibited the entry and replication of X4, but not R5, virus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We propose that one functional consequence of secreted Tat is to select against X4 viruses, thereby influencing the early in vivo course of HIV-1 disease."
9225044,Both A type and B type Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 6 interact with RBP-2N.,"Using the yeast two-hybrid system, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 6A (EBNA6A) was found to interact with the RBP-2N isoform of RBP-J kappa. The interaction of EBNA6A and EBNA6B with RBP-2N was compared and the results indicated that EBNA6B was less efficient at interacting with RBP-2N than was EBNA6A. Deletion mutation analysis of EBNA6A identified a region involved in the interaction with RBP-2N, while analysis of RBP-2N identified a domain which interacts with EBNA6A. The region of RBP-2N to which EBNA6A binds has previously been shown to interact with EBNA2."
15596820,The Epstein-Barr virus replication protein BBLF2/3 provides an origin-tethering function through interaction with the zinc finger DNA binding protein ZBRK1 and the KAP-1 corepressor.,"Herpesviruses encode a set of core proteins essential for lytic replication of their genomes. Three of these proteins form a tripartite helix-primase complex that, in the case of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), consists of the helicase BBLF4, the primase BSLF1, and the linker protein BBLF2/3. BBLF2/3 and its homologs in the other herpesviruses remain relatively poorly characterized. To better understand the contribution to replication made by BBLF2/3, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with BBLF2/3 as the bait protein. This screen identified as interactors a number of cell replication-related proteins such as DNA polymerase beta and subunits of DNA polymerase delta along with the EBV-encoded DNase BGLF5. The screen also identified the DNA binding zinc finger protein ZBRK1 and the ZBRK1 corepressor KAP-1 as BBLF2/3 interactors. Interaction between BBLF2/3 and ZBRK1 and KAP-1 was confirmed in coimmunoprecipitation assays. A binding site for ZBRK1 in the EBV oriLyt enhancer was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. ZBRK1, KAP-1, and the ZBRK1 binding protein BRCA1 were shown by indirect immunofluorescence to be present in replication compartments in lytically induced D98-HR1 cells, and additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays determined that these proteins associated with oriLyt DNA. Replication of an oriLyt plasmid and a variant oriLyt (DeltaZBRK1) plasmid was examined in lytically induced D98-HR1 cells. Exogenous ZBRK1, KAP-1, or BRCA1 increased the efficiency of oriLyt replication, while deletion of the ZBRK1 binding site impaired replication. These experiments identify ZBRK1 as another cell protein that, through BBLF2/3, provides a tethering point on oriLyt for the EBV replication complex. The data also suggest that BBLF2/3 may serve as a contact interface for cell proteins involved in replication of EBV oriLyt."
9030555,"Interaction of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I Tax, Ets1, and Sp1 in transactivation of the PTHrP P2 promoter.","We have previously shown that the parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) promoter contains binding sites for transcription factors Ets1 and Sp1 and that human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) Tax cooperates with Ets1 to transactivate the PTHrP P2 promoter. Using the yeast two-hybrid interaction system, we now provide evidence that Tax interacts with Ets1. Moreover, a double mutation (D22A,C23S) in the Tax protein that abrogated the Tax/Ets1 interaction also inhibited the Tax/Ets1 cooperative effect, suggesting that the interaction between Tax and Ets1 is important for transactivation of the PTHrP promoter. In coimmunoprecipitation assays, we find that Tax facilitates the interaction between Ets1 and Sp1, forming a ternary complex. When the Sp1 site in the PTHrP promoter was mutated, the Tax/Ets1 cooperative effect was dramatically decreased. This suggests that Sp1 plays an important role in the Ets1-dependent Tax transactivation of the PTHrP P2 promoter. Finally, we demonstrate that Gal4-Tax is a strong activator of the Gal PTHrP promoter, implying that Tax contributes directly to the transcriptional activation of the promoter. We propose a model in which the Tax/Ets1 cooperative effect on the PTHrP P2 promoter is based on the ability of Tax, Ets1, and Sp1 to form a ternary complex on the template DNA. Tax facilitates the interaction of Ets1/Sp1 and participates directly in the transcription initiation process."
19701248,Functional interaction of HTLV-1 tax protein with the POZ domain of the transcriptional repressor BCL6.,"The Tax protein encoded by human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has a pivotal role in T-cell transformation by deregulating cellular signalling pathways. Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human leukocyte cDNA library, we identified BCL6 (B-cell lymphoma 6) as a cellular protein, which interacts with Tax 1. The BCL6 gene encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor that contains a conserved N-terminal poxvirus and zinc finger (POZ) repressor domain and a C-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger DNA binding domain. Using both in vivo and in vitro methods, we demonstrate that the POZ domain of BCL6 is sufficient for its interaction with Tax 1. Using functional assays, we demonstrate that Tax 1 enhanced the repressive activity of BCL6 and increased the levels of apoptosis induced by BCL6 in osteosarcoma cells indicating that both proteins cooperate in vivo to cause a physiological affect. Furthermore, BCL6 recruited Tax 1 into punctate nuclear structures, which suggests that Tax 1 colocalizes with BCL6 in repressor complexes in vivo. BCL6 expression significantly downregulated both basal and Tax-induced nuclear factor-kappaB and long terminal repeat activation. This suggests that the expression of BCL6 in HTLV infected cells may contribute to the silencing of viral gene expression and to the long clinical latency associated with HTLV infection."
9765390,Herpes simplex virus 1 regulatory protein ICP22 interacts with a new cell cycle-regulated factor and accumulates in a cell cycle-dependent fashion in infected cells.,"The herpes simplex virus 1 infected cell protein 22 (ICP22), the product of the alpha22 gene, is a nucleotidylylated and phosphorylated nuclear protein with properties of a transcriptional factor required for the expression of a subset of viral genes. Here, we report the following. (i) ICP22 interacts with a previously unknown cellular factor designated p78 in the yeast two-hybrid system. The p78 cDNA encodes a polypeptide with a distribution of leucines reminiscent of a leucine zipper. (ii) In uninfected and infected cells, antibody to p78 reacts with two major bands with an apparent Mr of 78,000 and two minor bands with apparent Mrs of 62, 000 and 55,000. (ii) p78 also interacts with ICP22 in vitro. (iii) In uninfected cells, p78 was dispersed largely in the nucleoplasm in HeLa cells and in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm in HEp-2 cells. After infection, p78 formed large dense bodies which did not colocalize with the viral regulatory protein ICP0. (iv) Accumulation of p78 was cell cycle dependent, being highest very early in S phase. (v) The accumulation of ICP22 in synchronized cells was highest in early S phase, in contrast to the accumulation of another protein, ICP27, which was relatively independent of the cell cycle. (vi) In the course of the cell cycle, ICP22 was transiently modified in an aberrant fashion, and this modification coincided with expression of p78. The results suggest that ICP22 interacts with and may be stabilized by cell cycle-dependent proteins."
15613341,Human N-myristoyltransferases form stable complexes with lentiviral nef and other viral and cellular substrate proteins.,"Nef is a multifunctional virulence factor of primate lentiviruses that facilitates viral replication in the infected host. All known functions of Nef require that it be myristoylated at its N terminus. This reaction is catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferases (NMTs), which transfer myristate from myristoyl coenzyme A (myristoyl-CoA) to the N-terminal glycine of substrate proteins. Two NMT isoforms (NMT-1 and NMT-2) are expressed in mammalian cells. To provide a better mechanistic understanding of Nef function, we used biochemical and microsequencing techniques to isolate and identify Nef-associated proteins. Through these studies, NMT-1 was identified as an abundant Nef-associated protein. The Nef-NMT-1 complex is most likely a transient intermediate of the myristoylation reaction of Nef and is modulated by agents which affect the size of the myristoyl-CoA pool in the cell. We also examined two other proteins that bear an N-terminal myristoylation signal, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag and Hck protein tyrosine kinase, and found that Gag bound preferentially the NMT-2 isoform, while Hck bound mostly to NMT-1. Recognition of different NMT isoforms by these viral and cellular substrate proteins suggests nonoverlapping roles for these enzymes in vivo and reveals a potential for the development of inhibitors that target the myristoylation of specific viral substrates more selectively."
11312667,HBV X protein targets HIV Tat-binding protein 1.,"The HBV X protein (HBx) is implicated in infection and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. HBx has a pleiotropic effect on cells, suggesting multiple targets in the virus-host cell interaction. We employed the cytoplasmic-based two-hybrid screen and identified the HIV Tat-binding protein 1 (Tbp1) as a novel HBx interacting protein. Tbp1 interacts in vivo with HBx both in yeast and in animal cells. This interaction maps to the functionally important ATP-binding motif of Tbp1. Furthermore, HBx and Tbp1 interaction is functionally significant and regulates HBV transcription. Tbp1 homologues, such as Sug1, are known members of the proteasome 19S regulatory cap particle and have also been implicated in transcription coactivation. Remarkably, Tbp1 and Sug1 interact with multiple viral effector proteins including HIV Tat, SV40 large T antigen, and adenovirus E1A, establishing these proteins as important targets of the viral oncogenes."
9223516,Interaction of the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein with hepatitis B virus X protein is conserved among mammalian hepadnaviruses and restricted to transactivation-proficient X-insertion mutants.,"We carried out a comparative analysis of several proposed host protein partners of the human hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) using both the GAL4- and the LexA-based yeast two-hybrid system. We showed that the interaction of HBx with the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UVDDB) is positive in both yeast systems, detectable in cotransfected human cells, conserved by rodent hepadnavirus X proteins (known to transactivate in human cells), and tightly correlated with the transactivation proficiency of X-insertion mutants. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that UVDDB is involved in X-mediated transactivation."
15220430,Cellular distribution of Lysyl-tRNA synthetase and its interaction with Gag during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 assembly.,"Lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) is packaged into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) via its interaction with Gag, and this enzyme facilitates the selective packaging of tRNA(3)(Lys), the primer for initiating reverse transcription, into HIV-1. The Gag/LysRS interaction is detected at detergent-resistant membrane but not in membrane-free cell compartments that contain Gag and LysRS. LysRS is found (i). in the nucleus, (ii). in a cytoplasmic high-molecular-weight aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (HMW aaRS complex), (iii). in mitochondria, and (iv). associated with plasma membrane. The cytoplasmic form of LysRS lacking the mitochondrial import signal was previously shown to be efficiently packaged into virions, and in this report we also show that LysRS compartments in nuclei, in the HMW aaRS complex, and at the membrane are also not required as a primary source for viral LysRS. Exogenous mutant LysRS species unable to either enter the nucleus or bind to the cell membrane are still incorporated into virions. Many HMW aaRS components are not packaged into the virion along with LysRS, and the interaction of LysRS with p38, a protein that binds tightly to LysRS in the HMW aaRS complex, is not required for the incorporation of LysRS into virions. These data indicate that newly synthesized LysRS may interact rapidly with Gag before the enzyme has the opportunity to move to the above-mentioned cellular compartments. In confirmation of this idea, we found that newly synthesized LysRS is associated with Gag after a 10-min pulse with [(35)S]cysteine/methionine. This observation is also supported by previous work indicating that the incorporation of LysRS into HIV-1 is very sensitive to the inhibition of new synthesis of LysRS."
16247477,The hepatitis B virus X protein enhances AP-1 activation through interaction with Jab1.,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has many cellular functions and is a major factor in hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma caused by HBV infection. A proteomic approach was used to search for HBx-interacting proteins in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis. HBx was attached to myc and flag tags (MEF tags) and expressed in 293T cells; the protein complex formed within the cells was purified and characterized by mass spectrometry. COP9 signalosome (CSN) subunits 3 and 4 were subsequently identified as HBx-interacting proteins. In addition, CSN subunit 5, Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1), was shown to be a novel cellular target of HBx. In vivo and in vitro interactions between HBx and Jab1 were confirmed by standard immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. An analysis of HBx deletion constructs showed that amino acids 30-125 of HBx were responsible for binding to Jab1. Confocal laser microscopy demonstrated that HBx was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, while Jab1 was found mainly in the nucleus and partially in the cytoplasm, and that the two proteins colocalized in the cytoplasm. The cotransfection of HBx and Jab1 resulted in substantial activator protein 1 (AP-1) activation and knockdown of endogenous Jab1 attenuated AP-1 activation caused by HBx. In addition, the coexpression of HBx and Jab1 potentiated phosphorylation of JNK, leading to the subsequent phosphorylation of c-Jun, whereas the level of c-Jun and JNK phosphorylation induced by HBx was decreased in Jab1 knockdown cells. These results suggest that the interaction between HBx and Jab1 enhances HBx-mediated AP-1 activation."
15537645,Analysis of HIV-1 viral infectivity factor-mediated proteasome-dependent depletion of APOBEC3G: correlating function and subcellular localization.,"To study how HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) mediates proteasome-dependent depletion of host factor APOBEC3G, functional and nonfunctional Vif-APOBEC3G interactions were correlated with subcellular localization. APOBEC3G localized throughout the cytoplasm and co-localized with gamma-tubulin, 20 S proteasome subunit, and ubiquitin at punctate cytoplasmic bodies that can be used to monitor the Vif-APOBEC3G interaction in the cell. Through immunostaining and live imaging, we showed that a substantial fraction of Vif localized to the nucleus, and this localization was impaired by deletion of amino acids 12-23. When co-expressed, Vif exhibited more pronounced localization to the cytoplasm and reduced the total cellular levels of APOBEC3G but rarely co-localized with APOBEC3G at cytoplasmic bodies. On the contrary, Vif(C114S), which is inactive but continues to interact with APOBEC3G, stably associated with APOBEC3G in the cytoplasm, resulting in complete co-localization at cytoplasmic bodies and a dose-dependent exclusion of Vif(C114S) from the nucleus. Following proteasome inhibition, cytoplasmic APOBEC3G levels increased, and both proteins co-accumulated nonspecifically into a vimentin-encaged aggresome. Furthermore in the presence or absence of APOBEC3G, Vif localization was significantly altered by proteasome inhibition, suggesting that aberrant localization may also contribute to the loss of Vif function. Finally mutations at Vif Ile(9) disrupted the ability of Vif or Vif(C114S) to coimmunoprecipitate and to co-localize with APOBEC3G, suggesting that the N terminus of Vif mediates interactions with APOBEC3G. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cytoplasmic Vif-APOBEC3G interactions are required but are not sufficient for Vif to modulate APOBEC3G and can be monitored by co-localization in vivo."
11765921,The US2 gene product of herpes simplex virus type 2 interacts with cytokeratin 18.,"In order to clarify the biological role of US2 gene product of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), a HeLa cDNA library was screened in the yeast two-hybrid system using US2 protein as bait, and several interacting proteins were identified, including cytokeratin 18. US2 protein was co-immunoprecipitated with cytokeratin 18 from HSV-2 infected cell lysates. Analysis of infected orA431 cells by immunofluorescence showed that US2 protein gave filamentous or dot-like cytoplasmic staining pattern, and that it co-localized with cytokeratin 18. When US2 protein was expressed alone, it co-localized with cytokeratin 18. To define the domain interacting with cytokeratin 18, deletion mutant proteins were constructed and cells transfected with mutants were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. These results suggest that the N-terminal half of the US2 protein, especially the region containing amino acids 42-77, is important for interaction with cytokeratin 18."
11752160,Binding of FADD and caspase-8 to molluscum contagiosum virus MC159 v-FLIP is not sufficient for its antiapoptotic function.,"Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a member of the human poxvirus family, encodes the MC159 protein that inhibits Fas-, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligant (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. We used site-directed mutagenesis to change charged or hydrophobic amino acid residues to alanines to identify regions of MC159 that are critical for protection from apoptosis and for protein-protein interactions. Surprisingly, while MC159 is thought to block apoptosis by binding to Fas-associated death domain (FADD) or caspase-8, several mutants that lost apoptosis blocking activity still bound to both FADD and caspase-8. Mutations in the predicted hydrophobic patch 1 and alpha2 regions of both death effector domains (DEDs) within MC159 resulted in loss of the ability to bind to FADD or caspase-8 and to block apoptosis. Amino acid substitutions in the RXDL motif located in the alpha6 region of either DED resulted in loss of protection from apoptosis induced by Fas, TNF, and TRAIL and abolished the ability of MC159 to block death effector filament formation. Thus, charged or hydrophobic amino acids in three regions of the MC159 DEDs (hydrophobic patch 1, alpha2, and alpha6) are critical for the protein's ability to interact with cellular proteins and to block apoptosis."
16003387,Modified vaccinia virus Ankara protein F1L is a novel BH3-domain-binding protein and acts together with the early viral protein E3L to block virus-associated apoptosis.,"Infection with viruses often protects the infected cell against external stimuli to apoptosis. Here we explore the balance of apoptosis induction and inhibition for infection with the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), using two MVA mutants with experimentally introduced deletions. Deletion of the E3L-gene from MVA transformed the virus from an inhibitor to an inducer of apoptosis. Noxa-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were resistant to MVA-DeltaE3L-induced apoptosis. When the gene encoding F1L was deleted from MVA, apoptosis resulted that required Bak or Bax. MVA-DeltaF1L-induced apoptosis was blocked by Bcl-2. When expressed in HeLa cells, F1L blocked apoptosis induced by forced expression of the BH3-only proteins, Bim, Puma and Noxa. Finally, biosensor analysis confirmed direct binding of F1L to BH3 domains. These data describe a molecular framework of how a cell responds to MVA infection by undergoing apoptosis, and how the virus blocks apoptosis by interfering with critical steps of its signal transduction."
18278468,Screening for novel binding proteins interacting with human papillomavirus type 18 E6 oncogene in the Hela cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid system.,"To screen for novel binding proteins interacting with high-risk HPV 18 E6 oncogene, the strain AH109 was transformed with pGBKT7-HPV18 E6 plasmid, and subsequent transference was utilized to screen for interacting proteins with HPV 18 E6 in human Hela cDNA library. HPV18 E6 mRNA was expressed in yeast and there was no self-activation and toxicity in AH109. Seven proteins that interacted with HPV18 E6, including transmembrane protein 87B, phosphonoformate immuno-associated protein 5, vimentin, KM-HN-1 protein, dedicator of cytokinesis 7, vaccinia related kinase 2 and a hypothetical protein, were identified. It was suggested that yeast two-hybrid system is an efficient for screening interacting proteins. The high-risk HPV 18 E6 oncogene may interact with the proteins, which may be associated with signal transduction and transcriptional control, epithelial cell invasion and migration, as well as humoral and cellular immune etc. This investigation provides functional clues for further exploration of potential oncogenesis targets for cancer biotherapy."
11208076,Two independent regions of HIV-1 Nef are required for connection with the endocytic pathway through binding to the mu 1 chain of AP1 complex.,"The Nef protein from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induces down-regulation of the CD4 and major histocompatibility complex class I molecules from the cell surface by interfering with the endocytic machinery. This work focuses on the interaction of HIV-1 Nef with the mu 1 chain of adaptor protein type 1 (AP1) complex and its contribution to the Nef-induced alterations of membrane trafficking. Two independent regions surrounding a disordered loop located in the C-terminal part of Nef are involved in mu 1 binding. Each region can separately interact with mu 1, and simultaneous point mutations within both regions are needed to abolish binding. We used CD8 chimeras in which the cytoplasmic tail was replaced by Nef mutants to show that these mu 1-binding sites contain determinants required to induce CD4 down-regulation and to target the chimera to the endocytic pathway by promoting AP1 complex recruitment. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the CD8-Nef chimera provokes morphological alterations of the endosomal compartments and co-localizes with AP1 complexes. These data indicate that the recruitment by Nef of AP1 via binding to mu 1 participates in the connection of Nef with the endocytic pathway."
17295834,Host factor Ebp1: selective inhibitor of influenza virus transcriptase.,"Influenza virus RNA polymerase is composed of three virus-coded proteins, and is involved in both transcription and replication of the negative-strand genome RNA. Subunit PB1 plays key roles in both the RNA polymerase assembly and the catalytic function of RNA polymerization. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, a HeLa cell protein with the molecular mass of 45 kDa was identified. After cloning and sequencing, this protein was identified to be Ebp1, ErbB3-binding protein. Epb1 specifically interacts with PB1 both in vitro and in vivo, and Epb1 contact site on PB1 was mapped at its binding site of transcription primers. Ebp1 was found to interfere with in vitro RNA synthesis by influenza virus RNA polymerase (3P complex), but no inhibition was observed for capped RNA endonuclease and RNA-cap binding, the intrinsic activities of RNA polymerase. Since inhibition was not observed against other nucleic acid polymerases tested, we propose that Ebp1 is a selective inhibitor of influenza viral RNA polymerase. Accordingly over-expression of Ebp1 interfered with virus production. The PB1-contact site on Ebp1 overlaps with the interaction site with ErbB3 (epidermal receptor tyrosine kinase), androgen receptor (AR) and retinoblastoma gene product (Rb), which are involved in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation."
11554768,p38: A novel protein that associates with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein.,"The vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) is a model transmembrane glycoprotein that has been extensively used to study the exocytotic pathway. The cytoplasmic domain of VSV G contains information for several intracellular sorting steps including efficient export from the ER, basolateral delivery, and endocytosis. In order to identify proteins that potentially interact with the polypeptide sorting motifs in the VSV G tail, the carboxy-terminal 27 amino acids of VSV G were used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system. The protein identified most frequently in the screen is a novel protein of 38 kDa, p38. In the present work, the initial molecular and biochemical characterization of p38 is described. Preliminary evidence suggests that p38 may interact transiently with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and thus may affect VSV G and other cargo movement at the step of ER to Golgi traffic."
18684816,Bap31 is a novel target of the human papillomavirus E5 protein.,"The E5 proteins of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small hydrophobic proteins that are expressed in the early and late stages of the viral life cycle; however, their role in HPV pathogenesis is not clearly understood. In this study, a split-ubiquitin yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid system was used to identify B-cell-associated protein 31 (Bap31) as a binding partner of HPV E5 proteins. The association of these proteins was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of complexes of Bap31 with either HPV type 16 (HPV16) or HPV31 E5. In addition, Bap31 and E5 were found to colocalize in perinuclear patterns consistent with localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutational analysis of E5 identified amino acids in the extreme C terminus as important for stabilizing the interaction with Bap31. Deletion of these C-terminal amino acids of E5 in the context of complete HPV31 genomes resulted in impaired proliferative capacity of HPV-positive keratinocytes following differentiation. When small interfering RNAs were used to reduce the levels of Bap31, the proliferative ability of HPV-positive keratinocytes upon differentiation was also reduced, implicating Bap31 as a regulator of this process. These studies identify a novel binding partner of the high-risk HPV E5 proteins and provide insight into how the E5 proteins may modulate the life cycle in differentiating cells."
11222675,Type D retrovirus Gag polyprotein interacts with the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC.,"The carboxy terminus-encoding portion of the gag gene of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV), the prototype immunosuppressive primate type D retrovirus, encodes a 36-amino-acid, proline-rich protein domain that, in the mature virion, becomes the p4 capsid protein. The p4 domain has no known role in M-PMV replication. We found that two mutants with premature termination codons that remove half or all of the p4 domain produced lower levels of stable Gag protein and of self-assembled capsids. Interestingly, yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that p4 specifically interacted with TCP-1gamma, a subunit of the chaperonin TRiC (TCP-1 ring complex). TRiC is a cytosolic chaperonin that is known to be involved in both folding and subunit assembly of a variety of cellular proteins. TCP-1gamma also associated with high specificity with the M-PMV pp24/16-p12 domain and human immunodeficiency virus p6. Moreover, in cells, Gag polyprotein associated with the TRiC chaperonin complex and this association depended on ATP hydrolysis. In the p4 truncation mutants, the Gag-TRiC association was significantly reduced. These results strongly suggest that cytosolic chaperonin TRiC is involved in Gag folding and/or capsid assembly. We propose that TRiC associates transiently with nascent M-PMV Gag molecules to assist in their folding. Consequently, properly folded Gag molecules carry out the intermolecular interactions involved in self-assembly of the immature capsid."
10409763,The Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 engages the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated proteins TRADD and receptor-interacting protein (RIP) but does not induce apoptosis or require RIP for NF-kappaB activation.,"A site in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforming protein LMP1 that constitutively associates with the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain protein TRADD to mediate NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation is critical for long-term lymphoblastoid cell proliferation. We now find that LMP1 signaling through TRADD differs from TNFR1 signaling through TRADD. LMP1 needs only 11 amino acids to activate NF-kappaB or synergize with TRADD in NF-kappaB activation, while TNFR1 requires approximately 70 residues. Further, LMP1 does not require TRADD residues 294 to 312 for NF-kappaB activation, while TNFR1 requires TRADD residues 296 to 302. LMP1 is partially blocked for NF-kappaB activation by a TRADD mutant consisting of residues 122 to 293. Unlike TNFR1, LMP1 can interact directly with receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and stably associates with RIP in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. Surprisingly, LMP1 does not require RIP for NF-kappaB activation. Despite constitutive association with TRADD or RIP, LMP1 does not induce apoptosis in EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma or human embryonic kidney 293 cells. These results add a different perspective to the molecular interactions through which LMP1, TRADD, and RIP participate in B-lymphocyte activation and growth."
12009866,Interaction between Nef and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase leads to activation of p21-activated kinase and increased production of HIV.,"The negative factor (Nef) is one of six accessory proteins from primate lentiviruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV). It leads to high levels of viremia and the progression to AIDS in monkeys and humans. In this study, we demonstrated that Nef from HIV-1 binds to the regulatory subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). This interaction depended on the C-terminus of p85 and Nef. Moreover, PI3K was required to activate the Nef-associated p21-activated kinase (PAK). Finally, inhibition of PI3K blocked the activation of PAK and decreased the production of viral particles to levels observed with the Nef-deleted provirus. We conclude that Nef assembles a multiprotein signaling complex which is required for the optimal replication of HIV-1."
10224289,Induction of Fas ligand expression by HIV involves the interaction of Nef with the T cell receptor zeta chain.,"During HIV/SIV infection, there is widespread programmed cell death in infected and, perhaps more importantly, uninfected cells. Much of this apoptosis is mediated by Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) interactions. Previously we demonstrated in macaques that induction of FasL expression and apoptotic cell death of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells by SIV is dependent on a functional nef gene. However, the molecular mechanism whereby HIV-1 induces the expression of FasL remained poorly understood. Here we report a direct association of HIV-1 Nef with the zeta chain of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex and the requirement of both proteins for HIV-mediated upregulation of FasL. Expression of FasL through Nef depended upon the integrity of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of the TCR zeta chain. Conformation for the importance of zeta for Nef-mediated signaling in T cells came from an independent finding. A single ITAM motif of zeta but not CD3epsilon was both required and sufficient to promote activation and binding of the Nef-associated kinase (NAK/p62). Our data imply that Nef can form a signaling complex with the TCR, which bypasses the requirement of antigen to initiate T cell activation and subsequently upregulation of FasL expression. Thus, our study may provide critical insights into the molecular mechanism whereby the HIV-1 accessory protein Nef contributes to the pathogenesis of HIV."
15789261,HBx protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV) can form complex with mitochondrial HSP60 and HSP70.,"HBx, a transcriptional transactivating protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), is required for viral infection and has been implicated in virus-mediated liver oncogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism for its influence on cell remains largely unknown. It was proved that HBx need the help of host cell proteins to exert its function by binding to them. During purifying of GSTX (fusion protein of GST and HBx) expressed in E. coli, we found that it can bind specifically with GrpE (HSP60) and DnaK (HSP70) of E. coli while GST cannot. Using GST pull-down, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrum, we found that GSTX can also bind to human mitochondrial HSP60 and HSP70, which are homologues of GrpE and DnaK. These interactions between HBx and mitochondrial HSP60 and HSP70 are supported by the result of co-immunoprecipitation experiment. It means that HBx can form complex with E. coli and human HSP60 and HSP70. The implication of HBx, HSP60 and HSP70 complex in molecular mechanism of virus infection is discussed."
11223251,Cytoplasmic retention of HIV-1 regulatory protein Vpr by protein-protein interaction with a novel human cytoplasmic protein VprBP.,"Vpr is an HIV-1 auxiliary regulatory protein packaged in the virion. It has been shown to enhance the nuclear transport of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex, activate transcription of cellular and viral promoters, and arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M check-point. We previously identified a cellular protein of 180 kDa (RIP) that interacted with HIV-1 Vpr specifically. We now rename this cellular protein as Vpr-binding protein, or VprBP. In this report, we describe the cloning of the VprBP cDNA that encodes 1507 aa residues and is identical to the previously cloned cDNA KIAA0800. We demonstrate that Vpr specifically interacts with recombinantly expressed VprBP in vitro as well as in vivo. Furthermore, Vpr interacts with the cellular endogenous VprBP in the context of the HIV-1 life cycle. Mutational analysis of VprBP suggests that the Vpr binding domain is located within the C-terminal half of VprBP, which has a Pro-rich domain and several Phe-x-x-Phe repeats. Subcellular fractionation studies show that both the endogenous VprBP and the adenovirus-expressed VprBP are distributed predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction. Consistent with previous reports, the adenovirus-expressed Vpr is distributed in both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear fractions. However, when VprBP and Vpr are expressed together, Vpr is found almost exclusively in the cytoplasm. Expression of VprBP does not affect the nuclear transport of the adenoviral nuclear protein, pTP. VprBP expressed in insect cells also blocks the nuclear transport of a Vpr-GFP fusion protein, and VprBP mutants incapable of interacting with Vpr fail to block Vpr-GFP nuclear transport. We hypothesize that Vpr interaction with VprBP may cause changes in the host cell cytoplasm that affect HIV-1 pathogenesis as well as HIV-1 replication."
15976924,Mapping the binding site of full length HIV-1 Nef on human Lck SH3 by NMR spectroscopy.,"The Nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is known to directly bind to the SH3 domain of human lymphocyte specific kinase (Lck) via a proline-rich region located in the amino terminal part of Nef. To address the question whether Nef binding to Lck SH3 involves residues outside the typical poly-proline peptide binding site and whether the Lck unique domain is involved in Nef-Lck interaction, we studied the direct interaction between both molecules using recombinant full-length HIV-1 Nef protein on one side and recombinantly expressed and uniformly 15N-isotope labeled Lck protein comprising unique and SH3 domains on the other side. Applying nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy we could show that only residues of Lck SH3, that are typically involved in binding poly-proline peptides, are affected by Nef binding. Further, for the first time we could rule out that residues of Lck unique domain are involved in binding to full length Nef protein. Thus, interactions of Lck unique domain to cellular partners e.g. CD4 or CD8, are not necessarily competitive with Lck binding to HIV-1 Nef."
9252388,The hepatitis B virus X protein enhances the DNA binding potential and transcription efficacy of bZip transcription factors.,"The hepatitis B virus X protein interacts with the basic-region, leucine zipper protein (bZip) domain of cAMP response element-binding protein increasing its affinity for the cAMP response element site in vitro and its transcriptional efficacy in vivo (Williams, J. S., and Andrisani, O. M. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 3819-3823). Here we examine pX interactions with bZip transcription factors ATF3, gadd153/Chop10, ICER IIgamma, and NF-IL6. We demonstrate direct interactions in vitro between pX and the bZip proteins tested. In contrast MyoD and Gal4(1-147) fail to interact with pX. We also demonstrate by the mammalian two-hybrid assay the direct interaction of pX with cAMP response element- binding protein, ICER IIgamma, ATF3, and NF-IL6 in hepatocytes. In addition, pX increases the DNA binding potential of bZip proteins for their cognate DNA-binding site in vitro. In transient transfections in hepatocytes (AML12 cell line), pX increases the transcriptional efficacy of the bZip transcription factors. NF-IL6-mediated transcriptional activation is enhanced 3-fold by pX. Most interestingly, pX augments the repression mediated by bZip repressors ATF3 and ICER IIgamma, by 6- and 7-fold, respectively, demonstrating for the first time the involvement of pX in gene repression. We conclude that pX is an enhancer of the DNA binding potential of bZip transcription factors, thereby increasing the transactivation or repression efficacy of bZip-responsive genes."
17103045,Multiple interference of the human papillomavirus-16 E7 oncoprotein with the functional role of the metastasis suppressor Nm23-H1 protein.,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) are linked to human cervical and other ano-genital cancers. Integration of the viral genome in the transformed epithelial cells is restricted to the coding regions for the E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Nevertheless, E7 plays the major role in cell transformation. We report a novel interaction between HPV-16 E7 and the Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2 proteins identified in yeast by the two-hybrid system and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in the human keratinocyte HaCaT cell line. Expression of the E7 oncoprotein in HaCaT cells induces modified keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation patterns, and leads to down-modulation and functional inactivation of the metastasis suppressor Nm23-H1 protein. Both transcriptional down-regulation and protein degradation contribute to reduce Nm23-H1 intracellular content. Besides metastasis suppression, Nm23-H1 displays multiple functions in cell cycle regulation and differentiation, development, DNA regulation and caspase-independent apoptosis. As a consequence of Nm23-H1 inhibition, HPV-16 E7 expressing HaCaT cells, acquire invasiveness capabilities and resistance to granzyme A-induced apoptosis. We propose that impairment of the multifunctional role of Nm23-H1 is an important feature consistent with the complex strategy carried out by HPV-16 E7 to promote cell transformation and tumor progression."
12663786,Role of ESCRT-I in retroviral budding.,"Retroviral late-budding (L) domains are required for the efficient release of nascent virions. The three known types of L domain, designated according to essential tetrapeptide motifs (PTAP, PPXY, or YPDL), each bind distinct cellular cofactors. We and others have demonstrated that recruitment of an ESCRT-I subunit, Tsg101, a component of the class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) machinery, is required for the budding of viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Ebola virus, that encode a PTAP-type L domain, but subsequent events remain undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that VPS28, a second component of ESCRT-I, binds to a sequence close to the Tsg101 C terminus and is therefore recruited to the plasma membrane by HIV-1 Gag. In addition, we show that Tsg101 exhibits a multimerization activity. Using a complementation assay in which Tsg101 is artificially recruited to sites of HIV-1 assembly, we demonstrate that the integrity of the VPS28 binding site within Tsg101 is required for particle budding. In addition, mutation of a putative leucine zipper or residues important for Tsg101 multimerization also impairs the ability of Tsg101 to support HIV-1 budding. A minimal multimerizing Tsg101 domain is a dominant negative inhibitor of PTAP-mediated HIV-1 budding but does not inhibit YPDL-type or PPXY-type L-domain function. Nevertheless, YDPL-type L-domain activity is inhibited by expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of the class E VPS ATPase VPS4. These results indicate that all three classes of retroviral L domains require a functioning class E VPS pathway in order to effect budding. However, the PTAP-type L domain appears to be unique in its requirement for an intact, or nearly intact, ESCRT-I complex."
9564030,Mechanism of Nef-induced CD4 endocytosis: Nef connects CD4 with the mu chain of adaptor complexes.,"The Nef protein of primate lentiviruses down-regulates the cell surface expression of CD4 and probably MHC I by connecting these receptors with the endocytic machinery. Here, we reveal that Nef interacts with the mu chains of adaptor complexes, key components of clathrin-coated pits. For human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Nef, this interaction occurs via tyrosine-based motifs reminiscent of endocytosis signals. Mutating these motifs prevents the binding of SIV Nef to the mu chain of plasma membrane adaptor complexes, abrogates its ability to induce CD4 internalization, suppresses the accelerated endocytosis of a chimeric integral membrane protein harboring Nef as its cytoplasmic domain and confers a dominant-negative phenotype to the viral protein. Taken together, these data identify mu adaptins as downstream mediators of the down-modulation of CD4, and possibly MHC I, by Nef."
9843510,Recruitment of a protein complex containing Tat and cyclin T1 to TAR governs the species specificity of HIV-1 Tat.,"Human cyclin T1 (hCycT1), a major subunit of the essential elongation factor P-TEFb, has been proposed to act as a cofactor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat. Here, we show that murine cyclin T1 (mCycT1) binds the activation domain of HIV-1 Tat but, unlike hCycT1, cannot mediate Tat function because it cannot be recruited efficiently to TAR. In fact, overexpression of mCycT1, but not hCycT1, specifically inhibits Tat-TAR function in human cells. This discordant phenotype results from a single amino acid difference between hCycT1 and mCycT1, a tyrosine in place of a cysteine at residue 261. These data indicate that the ability of Tat to recruit CycT1/P-TEFb to TAR determines the species restriction of HIV-1 Tat function in murine cells and therefore demonstrate that this recruitment is a critical function of the Tat protein."
9425942,Identification of a protein isolated from senescent human cells that binds to hepatitis B virus X antigen.,"Hepatitis B virus-encoded X antigen contributes to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Given that X antigen functions by binding to other proteins, additional X-binding proteins were sought from an adult human liver cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid system. The results yielded a clone encoding a 55-kd protein that is associated with replicative senescence (p55sen). Binding of p55sen to X antigen was confirmed in vitro by immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography. The expression of endogenous p55sen inversely correlated with cell growth. Transient transfection of X antigen or p55sen into HepG2 cells stimulated DNA synthesis by twofold to threefold, whereas cotransfection did not, suggesting that these molecules functionally interact. The detection of p55sen in embryonic mouse liver, its absence in adult mouse and human livers, and its reappearance in livers from carriers with chronic liver disease, suggest that it may play important roles in the regulation of liver cell growth. The similarity between p55sen and a notch ligand, which is involved in cell fate determinations during embryogenesis, implies that the binding of p55sen by X antigen may also contribute to an alteration in cell fate, which is characteristic of carcinogenesis."
8114725,"The bZIP transactivator of Epstein-Barr virus, BZLF1, functionally and physically interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B.","The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BZLF1 (Z) immediate-early transactivator initiates the switch between latent and productive infection in B cells. The Z protein, which has homology to the basic leucine zipper protein c-Fos, transactivates the promoters of several replicative cycle proteins. Transactivation efficiency of the EBV BMRF1 promoter by Z is cell type dependent. In B cells, in which EBV typically exists in a latent form, Z activates the BMRF1 promoter inefficiently. We have discovered that the p65 component of the cellular factor NF-kappa B inhibits transactivation of several EBV promoters by Z. Furthermore, the inhibitor of NF-kappa B, I kappa B alpha, can augment Z-induced transactivation in the B-cell line Raji. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and coimmunoprecipitation studies, we demonstrate a direct interaction between Z and p65. This physical interaction, which requires the dimerization domain of Z and the Rel homology domain of p65, can be demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of Z transactivation function by NF-kappa B p65, or possibly by other Rel family proteins, may contribute to the inefficiency of Z transactivator function in B cells and may be a mechanism of maintaining B-cell-specific viral latency."
12810700,VEGF guides angiogenic sprouting utilizing endothelial tip cell filopodia.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) is a major regulator of blood vessel formation and function. It controls several processes in endothelial cells, such as proliferation, survival, and migration, but it is not known how these are coordinately regulated to result in more complex morphogenetic events, such as tubular sprouting, fusion, and network formation. We show here that VEGF-A controls angiogenic sprouting in the early postnatal retina by guiding filopodial extension from specialized endothelial cells situated at the tips of the vascular sprouts. The tip cells respond to VEGF-A only by guided migration; the proliferative response to VEGF-A occurs in the sprout stalks. These two cellular responses are both mediated by agonistic activity of VEGF-A on VEGF receptor 2. Whereas tip cell migration depends on a gradient of VEGF-A, proliferation is regulated by its concentration. Thus, vessel patterning during retinal angiogenesis depends on the balance between two different qualities of the extracellular VEGF-A distribution, which regulate distinct cellular responses in defined populations of endothelial cells."
11080810,Tax-dependent stimulation of G1 phase-specific cyclin-dependent kinases and increased expression of signal transduction genes characterize HTLV type 1-transformed T cells.,"Human T cell leukemia virus protein induces T cells to permanent IL-2-dependent growth. These cells occasionally convert to factor independence. The viral oncoprotein Tax acts as an essential growth factor of transformed lymphocytes and stimulates the cell cycle in the G(1) phase. In T cells and fibroblasts Tax enhances the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) CDK4 and CDK6. These kinases, which require binding to cyclin D isotypes for their activity, control the G(1) phase. Coimmunoprecipitation from these cells revealed that Tax associates with cyclin D3/CDK6, suggesting a direct activation of this kinase. The CDK stimulation may account in part for the mitogenic Tax effect, which causes IL-2-dependent T cell growth by Tax. To address the conversion to IL-2-independent proliferation and to identify overexpressed genes, which contribute to the transformed growth, the gene expression patterns of HTLV-1-transformed T cells were compared with that of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Potentially overexpressed cDNAs were cloned, sequenced, and used to determine the RNA expression. Genes found to be up-regulated are involved in signal transduction (STAT5a, cyclin G(1), c-fgr, hPGT) and also glycoprotein synthesis (LDLC, ribophorin). Many of these are also activated during T cell activation and implicated in the regulation of growth and apoptosis. The transcription factor STAT5a, which is involved in IL-2 signaling, was strongly up-regulated only in IL-2-independent cells, thus suggesting that it contributes to factor-independent growth. Thus, the differentially expressed genes could cooperate with the Tax-induced cell cycle stimulation in the maintenance of IL-2-dependent and IL-2-independent growth of HTLV-transformed lymphocytes."
19279106,NS5 of dengue virus mediates STAT2 binding and degradation.,"The mammalian interferon (IFN) signaling pathway is a primary component of the innate antiviral response. As such, viral pathogens have devised multiple mechanisms to antagonize this pathway and thus facilitate infection. Dengue virus (DENV) encodes several proteins (NS2a, NS4a, and NS4b) that have been shown individually to inhibit the IFN response. In addition, DENV infection results in reduced levels of expression of STAT2, which is required for IFN signaling (M. Jones, A. Davidson, L. Hibbert, P. Gruenwald, J. Schlaak, S. Ball, G. R. Foster, and M. Jacobs, J. Virol. 79:5414-5420, 2005). Translation of the DENV genome results in a single polypeptide, which is processed by viral and host proteases into at least 10 separate proteins. To date, no single DENV protein has been implicated in the targeting of STAT2 for decreased levels of expression. We demonstrate here that the polymerase of the virus, NS5, binds to STAT2 and is necessary and sufficient for its reduced level of expression. The decrease in protein level observed requires ubiquitination and proteasome activity, strongly suggesting an active degradation process. Furthermore, we show that the degradation of but not binding to STAT2 is dependent on the expression of the polymerase in the context of a polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic processing for NS5 maturation. Thus, the mature form of NS5, when not expressed as a precursor, was able to bind to STAT2 but was unable to target it for degradation, establishing a unique role for viral polyprotein processing in providing an additional function to a viral polypeptide. Therefore, we have identified both a novel mechanism by which DENV evades the innate immune response and a potential target for antiviral therapeutics."
18329616,Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 uses the COPII transport system for its intracellular transport.,"The Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 plays an important role in virion formation and viral egress from cells. However, the host cell proteins and mechanisms responsible for intracellular transport of VP40 prior to its contribution to virion formation remain to be elucidated. Therefore we used coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses to identify host proteins interacting with VP40. We found that Sec24C, a component of the host COPII vesicular transport system, interacts specifically with VP40 via VP40 amino acids 303 to 307. Coimmunoprecipitation and dominant-negative mutant studies indicated that the COPII transport system plays a critical role in VP40 intracellular transport to the plasma membrane. Marburg virus VP40 was also shown to use the COPII transport system for intracellular transport. These findings identify a conserved intersection between a host pathway and filovirus replication, an intersection that can be targeted in the development of new antiviral drugs."
17395420,Interaction of HTLV-1 Tax protein with calreticulin: implications for Tax nuclear export and secretion.,"Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The HTLV-1 transcriptional transactivator protein Tax plays an integral role in virus replication and disease progression. Traditionally, Tax is described as a nuclear protein where it performs its primary role as a transcriptional transactivator. However, recent studies have clearly shown that Tax can also be localized to the cytoplasm where it has been shown to interact with a number of host transcription factors most notably NF-kappaB, constitutive expression of which is directly related to the T cell transforming properties of Tax in ATL patients. The presence of a functional nuclear export signal (NES) within Tax and the secretion of full-length Tax have also been demonstrated previously. Additionally, release of Tax from HTLV-1-infected cells and the presence of cell-free Tax was demonstrated in the CSF of HAM/TSP patients suggesting that the progression to HAM/TSP might be mediated by the ability of Tax to function as an extracellular cytokine. Therefore, in both ATL and HAM/TSP Tax nuclear export and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling may play a critical role, the mechanism of which remains unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated that the calcium binding protein calreticulin interacts with Tax by co-immunoprecipitation. This interaction was found to localize to a region at or near the nuclear membrane. In addition, differential expression of calreticulin was demonstrated in various cell types that correlated with their ability to retain cytoplasmic Tax, particularly in astrocytes. Finally, a comparison of a number of HTLV-1-infected T cell lines to non-infected T cells revealed higher expression of calreticulin in infected cells implicating a direct role for this protein in HTLV-1 infection."
9685344,Cooperative actions of HIV-1 Vpr and p53 modulate viral gene transcription.,"Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) genome is controlled by cooperative interaction of viral encoded proteins and host regulatory proteins. In this study, we have examined the capacity of the viral auxiliary protein, Vpr, to modulate transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 promoter sequence located within the long terminal repeat (LTR). We demonstrate that ectopic expression of Vpr in human astrocytic cells, U-87MG, enhances the basal activity of the viral promoter in transfected cells and that the GC-rich sequences, spanning nucleotides -80 to -43, are important for this activity. Since this region serves as the target for p53-induced suppression of LTR activity and interacts with the ubiquitous transcription factor, Sp1, we examined the cooperative activity of Vpr, p53, and Sp1 upon LTR transcription. Results from co-transfection studies indicated that overexpression of wild type p53, but not mutant p53, decreases the level of activation of the LTR by Vpr. Transcriptional activation of the LTR by Vpr required the presence of Sp1 since overexpression of Vpr in cells with no endogenous Sp1 failed to augment LTR activity. Results from protein-protein interaction studies indicated that Vpr is associated with both p53 and Sp1 in cells with ectopic expression of these proteins. Moreover, it was evident that p53 and Sp1 interact with each other in these cells. These functional and structural studies provided a working model on the cooperative interaction of Vpr with cellular proteins Sp1 and p53 and control of viral gene transcription at immediate early stage of infection prior to the participation of other viral regulatory proteins."
10675569,The polyomavirus major capsid protein VP1 interacts with the nuclear matrix regulatory protein YY1.,"Polyomavirus reaches the nucleus in a still encapsidated form, and the viral genome is readily found in association with the nuclear matrix. This association is thought to be essential for viral replication. In order to identify the protein(s) involved in the virus-nuclear matrix interaction, we focused on the possible roles exerted by the multifunctional cellular nuclear matrix protein Yin Yang 1 (YY1) and by the viral major capsid protein VP1. In the present work we report on the in vivo association between YY1 and VP1. Using the yeast two-hybrid system we demonstrate that the VP1 and YY1 proteins physically interact through the D-E region of VP1 and the activation domain of YY1."
7592727,Interaction of virion protein Vpr of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 with cellular transcription factor Sp1 and trans-activation of viral long terminal repeat.,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a result of replication of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) predominantly in CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophages. However, most of these cells in vivo are immunologically quiescent, a condition restricting HIV-1 replication. Vpr is an HIV-1 virion protein suspected to enhance HIV-1 replication in vivo. We demonstrate in this report that Vpr specifically activates HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed transcription. This effect is most pronounced on a minimal promoter from HIV-1 LTR containing the TATA box and binding motifs for the ubiquitous cellular transcription factor Sp1. Evidence is presented that Vpr interacts with Sp1 when Sp1 is bound to the Sp1 motifs within the HIV-1 LTR Both Vpr-Sp1 interaction and Vpr trans-activation require a central Leu/Ile-rich domain in Vpr. Our findings suggest that Vpr trans-activation through Sp1 is most critical for the immediate early transcription of HIV-1 when other positive regulators, such as NF-kappa B, are limited or inactive, a condition presumably present in vivo. By interacting with Sp1, Vpr also has the potential to influence cellular gene expression and cellular functions. Thus, therapeutic approaches directed toward blocking the Vpr trans-activation function could prove valuable in treating AIDS."
15542638,A cyclin-binding motif within the amino-terminal homology domain of EBNA3C binds cyclin A and modulates cyclin A-dependent kinase activity in Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells.,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is a virus-encoded latent antigen essential for primary B-cell transformation. In this report we demonstrate that although the carboxy terminus of EBNA3C predominantly regulates cyclin A-dependent kinase activity, the region of greatest affinity for cyclin A lies within the EBNA3 amino-terminal homology domain of EBNA3C. Detailed mapping studies employing both in vitro binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments implicated a small region of EBNA3C, amino acids 130 to 159 within the EBNA3 homology domain, as having the greatest affinity for cyclin A. The EBNA3 homology domain has the highest degree of amino acid similarity (approximately 30%) between the EBNA3 proteins, and, indeed, EBNA3B, but not EBNA3A, showed binding activity with cyclin A. We also show that EBNA3C binds to the alpha1 helix of the highly conserved mammalian cyclin box, with cyclin A amino acids 206 to 226 required for strong binding to EBNA3C amino acids 130 to 159. Interestingly, EBNA3C also bound human cyclins D1 and E in vitro, although the affinity was approximately 30% of that seen for cyclin A. Previously it was demonstrated that full-length EBNA3C rescues p27-mediated suppression of cyclin A-dependent kinase activity (J. S. Knight and E. S. Robertson, J. Virol. 78:1981-1991, 2004). It was also demonstrated that the carboxy terminus of EBNA3C recapitulates this phenotype. Surprisingly, the amino terminus of EBNA3C with the highest affinity for cyclin A was unable to rescue p27 suppression of kinase activity and actually downregulates cyclin A activity when introduced into EBV-infected cells. The data presented here suggests that the amino terminus of EBNA3C may play an important role in recruiting cyclin A complexes, while the carboxy terminus of EBNA3C is necessary for the functional modulation of cyclin A complex kinase activity."
12511551,Role of protein kinase CK2 phosphorylation in the molecular chaperone activity of nucleolar protein b23.,"Protein B23 is a multifunctional nucleolar protein whose molecular chaperone activity is proposed to play role in ribosome assembly. Previous studies (Szebeni, A., and Olson, M. O. J. (1999) Protein Sci. 8, 905-912) showed that protein B23 has several characteristics typical of molecular chaperones, including anti-aggregation activity, promoting the renaturation of denatured proteins, and preferential binding to denatured substrates. However, until now there has been no proposed mechanism for release of a bound substrate. Protein B23 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 (CK2) in a segment required for chaperone activity. The presence of bound substrate enhanced the rate of CK2 phosphorylation of protein B23 by 2-3-fold, and this enhancement was dependent on a nonpolar region in its N-terminal end. Formation of a complex between B23 and chaperone test substrates (rhodanese or citrate synthase) was inhibited by CK2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, CK2 phosphorylation of a previously formed B23-substrate complex promoted its dissociation. The dissociation of complexes between B23 and the human immunodeficiency virus-Rev protein required both CK2 phosphorylation and competition with a Rev nuclear localization signal peptide, suggesting that Rev binds B23 at two separate sites. These studies suggest that unlike many molecular chaperones, which directly hydrolyze ATP, substrate release by protein B23 is dependent on its phosphorylation by CK2."
18005679,HSV-1 ICP34.5 confers neurovirulence by targeting the Beclin 1 autophagy protein.,"Autophagy is postulated to play a role in antiviral innate immunity. However, it is unknown whether viral evasion of autophagy is important in disease pathogenesis. Here we show that the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-encoded neurovirulence protein ICP34.5 binds to the mammalian autophagy protein Beclin 1 and inhibits its autophagy function. A mutant HSV-1 virus lacking the Beclin 1-binding domain of ICP34.5 fails to inhibit autophagy in neurons and demonstrates impaired ability to cause lethal encephalitis in mice. The neurovirulence of this Beclin 1-binding mutant virus is restored in pkr(-/-) mice. Thus, ICP34.5-mediated antagonism of the autophagy function of Beclin 1 is essential for viral neurovirulence, and the antiviral signaling molecule PKR lies genetically upstream of Beclin 1 in host defense against HSV-1. Our findings suggest that autophagy inhibition is a novel molecular mechanism by which viruses evade innate immunity and cause fatal disease."
12199906,Epstein-Barr virus encoded nuclear protein EBNA-3 binds a novel human uridine kinase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase.,Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects resting B-lymphocytes and transforms them into immortal proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in vitro. The transformed immunoblasts may grow up as immunoblastic lymphomas in immuno-suppressed hosts.
9751712,HIV-1 tat binds TAFII250 and represses TAFII250-dependent transcription of major histocompatibility class I genes.,"HIV Tat, a transactivator of viral transcription, represses transcription of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I genes. Repression depends exclusively on the C-terminal domain of Tat, although the mechanism of this repression has not been known. We now show that repression results from the interaction of Tat with the TAFII250 component of the general transcription factor, TFIID. The C-terminal domain of Tat binds to a site on TAFII250 that overlaps the histone acetyl transferase domain, inhibiting TAFII250 histone acetyl transferase activity. Furthermore, promoters repressed by Tat, including the MHC class I promoter, are dependent on TAFII250 whereas those that are not repressed by Tat, such as SV40 and MuLV promoters, are independent of functional TAFII250. Thus, Tat repression of MHC class I transcription would be one mechanism by which HIV avoids immune surveillance."
15956556,"Novel nuclear export signal-interacting protein, NESI, critical for the assembly of hepatitis delta virus.","The process of host factor-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport is critical for diverse cellular events in eukaryotes and the life cycle of viruses. We have previously identified a chromosome region maintenance 1-independent nuclear export signal (NES) at the C terminus of the large form of hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), designated NES(HDAg-L) that is required for the assembly of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) (C.-H. Lee et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:8142-8148, 2001). To look for interacting proteins of the NES(HDAg-L), yeast two-hybrid screening was applied using the GAL4-binding domain fused to the NES(HDAg-L) as bait. Among the positive clones, one encodes a protein, designated NESI [NES(HDAg-L) interacting protein] that specifically interacted with the wild-type NES(HDAg-L) but not with the export/package-defective HDAg-L mutant, NES*(HDAg-L), in which Pro-205 has been replaced by Ala. Northern blot analysis revealed NESI as the gene product of a 1.9-kb endogenous mRNA transcript that is present predominantly in human liver tissue. NESI consists of 467 amino acid residues and bears a putative actin-binding site and a bipartite nuclear localization signal. Specific interaction between HDAg-L and NESI was further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining. Overexpression of antisense NESI RNAs inhibited the expression of NESI and abolished HDAg-L-mediated nuclear export and assembly of HDV genomic RNA. These data indicate a critical role of NESI in the assembly of HDV through interaction with HDAg-L."
16215227,Functions of early (AP-2) and late (AIP1/ALIX) endocytic proteins in equine infectious anemia virus budding.,"The proline-rich L domains of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and other retroviruses interact with late endocytic proteins during virion assembly and budding. In contrast, the YPDL L domain of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is apparently unique in its reported ability to interact both with the mu2 subunit of the AP-2 adaptor protein complex and with ALG-2-interacting protein 1 (AIP1/Alix) protein factors involved in early and late endosome formation, respectively. To define further the mechanisms by which EIAV adapts vesicle trafficking machinery to facilitate virion production, we have examined the specificity of EIAV p9 binding to endocytic factors and the effects on virion production of alterations in early and late endocytic protein expression. The results of these studies demonstrated that (i) an approximately 300-residue region of AIP1/Alix-(409-715) was sufficient for binding to the EIAV YPDL motif; (ii) overexpression of AIP1/Alix or AP-2 mu2 subunit specifically inhibited YPDL-mediated EIAV budding; (iii) virion budding from a replication-competent EIAV variant with its L domain replaced by the HIV PTAP sequence was inhibited by wild type or mutant mu2 to a level similar to that observed when a dominant-negative mutant of Tsg101 was expressed; and (iv) overexpression or siRNA silencing of AIP1/Alix and AP-2 revealed additive suppression of YPDL-mediated EIAV budding. Taken together, these results indicated that both early and late endocytic proteins facilitate EIAV production mediated by either YPDL or PTAP L domains, suggesting a comprehensive involvement of endocytic factors in retroviral assembly and budding that can be accessed by distinct L domain specificities."
10748218,Structural and functional characterization of interaction between hepatitis B virus X protein and the proteasome complex.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has a unique fourth open reading frame coding for a 16.5-kDa protein known as hepatitis B virus X protein (HBX). The importance of HBX in the life cycle of HBV has been well established, but the underlying molecular function of HBX remains controversial. We previously identified a proteasome subunit PSMA7 that interacts specifically with HBX in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid system. Here we demonstrate that PSMC1, an ATPase-like subunit of the 19 S proteasome component, also interacts with HBX and PSMA7. Analysis of the interacting domains among PSMA7, PSMC1, and HBX by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis suggested a mutually competitive structural relationship among these polypeptides. The competitive nature of these interactions is further demonstrated using a modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system. The crucial HBX sequences involved in interaction with PSMA7 and PSMC1 are important for its function as a transcriptional coactivator. HBX, while functioning as a coactivator of AP-1 and acidic activator VP-16 in mammalian cells, had no effect on the transactivation function of their functional orthologs GCN4 and Gal4 in yeast. Overexpression of PSMC1 seemed to suppress the expression of various reporters in mammalian cells; this effect, however, was overcome by coexpression of HBX. In addition, HBX expression inhibited the cellular turnover of c-Jun and ubiquitin-Arg-beta-galactosidase, two well known substrates of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Thus, interaction of HBX with the proteasome complex in metazoan cells may underlie the functional basis of proteasome as a cellular target of HBX."
10846101,Interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 Vpx and invariant chain.,"Vpx is a virion-associated protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency viruses. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify invariant chain (Ii) as a cellular protein that interacts with HIV-2 Vpx. Vpx-Ii interaction was confirmed in cell-free reactions using bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and by coimmunoprecipitation in transfected and infected cells. In chronically infected cells expressing Vpx, Ii levels were markedly decreased, presumably due to enhanced degradation. These findings suggest that Vpx may disrupt major histocompatibility complex class II antigen presentation."
8764072,Proteasome complex as a potential cellular target of hepatitis B virus X protein.,"Although the biological importance of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBX) in the life cycle of hepatitis B virus has been well established, the cellular and molecular basis of its function remains largely undefined. Despite the association of multiple activities with HBX, none of them appear to provide a unifying hypothesis regarding the true biological function of HBX. Identification and characterization of cellular targets of HBX remain an essential goal in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of HBX. Using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid system, we have identified and characterized a novel subunit of the proteasome complex (XAPC7) that interacts specifically with HBX. We also showed that HBX binds specifically to XAPC7 in vitro. Mutagenesis studies have defined the domains of interaction to be critical for the function of HBX. Furthermore, overexpression of XAPC7 appeared to activate transcription by itself and antisense expression of XAPC7 was able to block transactivation by HBX. Therefore, the proteasome complex is possibly a functional target of HBX in cells."
11413368,"Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 5 interacts with HAX-1, a possible component of the B-cell receptor signalling pathway.","Using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA library with an Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 5 (EBNA5) molecule containing seven repeats of the W(1)W(2) domain as bait, we have isolated the EBNA5-interacting protein HAX-1. HAX-1 has previously been shown to associate with HS1, a protein specifically expressed in cells of the haematopoietic lineage, and is thought to be involved in signal transduction in B-cells. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that HAX-1 co-localized with the hsp60 protein that is associated with the mitochondria in the cell cytoplasm. Pull down experiments with a fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase and the seven copy repeat EBNA5 synthesized in bacteria and in yeast cells confirmed that HAX-1 can interact with EBNA5 in vitro. Conventionally, EBNA5 is regarded as a nuclear protein. However, we show here that the smallest EBNA5 species, composed of the unique Y domain and only one copy of the W(1)W(2) repeat domain, like HAX-1, co-localizes with the mitochondrial hsp60 protein in the B-cell cytoplasm. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that the single repeat EBNA5 associates with HAX-1 in transfected B-lymphoblastoid cells."
10557085,"Tax oncoprotein of HTLV-1 binds to the human homologue of Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein, hDLG, and perturbs its function in cell growth control.","HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein interacts with various cellular factors and modulates transcription and the cell cycle. To identify more cellular targets, we employed the yeast two hybrid system with Tax using a human cDNA library, and isolated a cDNA encoding the human counterpart of Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein, hDLG. Tax binding to hDLG was confirmed in vitro and also in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Furthermore, hDLG was found to be efficiently phosphorylated in Tax-transfected cells and HTLV-1-infected T-cells. The C-terminus of Tax and the PDZ domain of hDLG were responsible for the binding of Tax to hDLG. The C-terminal peptide of Tax prevented the binding of hDLG to APC tumor suppressor gene product, suggesting inhibition of hDLG function by Tax. Over-expression of hDLG in NIH3T3 cells by microinjection induced a reduction of BrdU incorporation into DNA, but co-expression of Tax suppressed this inhibitory effect of hDLG. These results suggest that hDLG arrested the cell cycle and that Tax canceled this inhibitory action of hDLG through targeting hDLG. Therefore, Tax affects this novel regulatory pathway of the cell cycle alteration, of which seems to play a role in the development of human cancer."
12196924,Expression of RB2/p130 tumor-suppressor gene in AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: implications for disease pathogenesis.,"In this study we examined 21 cases of AIDS-related lymphomas for genomic organization and expression of RB2/p130 oncosuppressor gene and compared the results with the proliferative features of these neoplasms. We found no mutations in the RB2/p130 gene and unusually high percentages of cells expressing nuclear pRb2/p130 in tumors with a high proliferative activity, such as AIDS-related lymphomas. These findings might suggest that a molecular mechanism usually observed in viral-linked oncogenesis could be involved. We performed in vitro and in vivo binding assays to investigate whether the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene product Tat and Rb2/p130 could interact. The results of these assays revealed that the HIV-1 Tat protein binds specifically to pRb2/p130. This may result in the inactivation of its oncosuppressive properties and the induction of genes needed to proceed through the cell cycle including p107, cyclin A, and cyclin B. Using single-cell polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, we found HIV-1 DNA in the neoplastic cells of only 2 of the 21 cases examined, whereas PCR on whole tissue revealed HIV-1 DNA in all of the cases. Furthermore, a diffuse and nuclear stain was observed in tissue sections with anti-Tat monoclonal antibody. These findings are in accordance with the notion that soluble Tat protein could function as a biologically active extracellular protein released by infected cells and taken up readily by uninfected B cells. In conclusion, our results seem to suggest that pRb2/p130 oncosuppressor protein may be a target in the interaction between the HIV-1 gene products and host proteins."
14759364,HIV-1 Nef mimics an integrin receptor signal that recruits the polycomb group protein Eed to the plasma membrane.,"The Nef protein of human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV/SIV) is believed to interfere with T cell activation signals by forming a signaling complex at the plasma membrane. Composition and function of the complex are not fully understood. Here we report that Nef recruits the Polycomb Group (PcG) protein Eed, so far known as a nuclear factor and repressor of transcription, to the membrane of cells. The Nef-induced translocation of Eed led to a potent stimulation of Tat-dependent HIV transcription, implying that Eed removal from the nucleus is required for optimal Tat function. Similar to Nef action, activation of integrin receptors recruited Eed to the plasma membrane, also leading to enhanced Tat/Nef-mediated transcription. Our results suggest a link between membrane-associated activation processes and transcriptional derepression and demonstrate how HIV exploits this mechanism."
12566418,The poxvirus protein A52R targets Toll-like receptor signaling complexes to suppress host defense.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial in the innate immune response to pathogens, in that they recognize and respond to pathogen associated molecular patterns, which leads to activation of intracellular signaling pathways and altered gene expression. Vaccinia virus (VV), the poxvirus used to vaccinate against smallpox, encodes proteins that antagonize important components of host antiviral defense. Here we show that the VV protein A52R blocks the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) by multiple TLRs, including TLR3, a recently identified receptor for viral RNA. A52R associates with both interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (IRAK2) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), two key proteins important in TLR signal transduction. Further, A52R could disrupt signaling complexes containing these proteins. A virus deletion mutant lacking the A52R gene was attenuated compared with wild-type and revertant controls in a murine intranasal model of infection. This study reveals a novel mechanism used by VV to suppress the host immunity. We demonstrate viral disabling of TLRs, providing further evidence for an important role for this family of receptors in the antiviral response."
9516470,The nucleolin binding activity of hepatitis delta antigen is associated with nucleolus targeting.,"Hepatitis delta antigens (HDAgs) are important for the replication and assembly of hepatitis delta virus (HDV). To understand the association between HDAgs and cellular proteins and the mechanism of viral multiplication, we have studied the interaction between HDAgs and nucleolin, a major nucleolar phosphoprotein. The interaction between HDAgs and nucleolin was first demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining studies. HDAgs and endogenous nucleolin were colocalized in the nucleoli of cultured cells transfected with plasmids encoding the small and large HDAg. Coimmunoprecipitation results indicated that the NH2-terminal domain of HDAg was essential for its binding to nucleolin. In vitro ligand binding assays revealed two nucleolin binding sites, NBS1 and NBS2. Each spanned amino acid residues 35-50 and 51-65, respectively, with a conserved core sequence K(K/R)XK. HDV replication was modulated by exogenous human nucleolin. In addition, a small HDAg mutant S-d65/75, which possesses both NBS1 and NBS2, was capable of transactivating HDV replication, whereas the small HDAg mutant S-d50/75, which retained NBS1 but not NBS2, was unable to support the replication of HDV. Thus, the nucleolin binding activity of HDAg is critical for its nucleolar targeting and is involved in the modulation of HDV replication."
16103149,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr induces the degradation of the UNG and SMUG uracil-DNA glycosylases.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) accessory protein Vpr has previously been shown to bind to the cellular uracil DNA glycosylase UNG. We show here that the binding of Vpr to UNG and to the related enzyme SMUG induces their proteasomal degradation. UNG and SMUG were found to be encapsidated in Deltavpr HIV-1 virions but were significantly less abundant in vpr(+) virions. Deltavpr virions contained readily detectable uracil-DNA glycosylase enzymatic activity, while the activity was reduced to undetectable levels in vpr(+) virions. Consistent with proteasomal degradation, complexes that contained Vpr and the E3 ubiquitin ligase components Cul1 and Cul4 were detected in cell lysates. We hypothesized that the interaction of Vpr might be a means for the virus to reduce the frequency of abasic sites in viral reverse transcripts at uracil residues caused by APOBEC3-catalyzed deamination of cytosine residues. Although APOBEC3 is largely neutralized by the Vif accessory protein, residual enzyme could remain in virions that would generate uracils. In support of this, Deltavif vpr(+) HIV-1 produced in the presence of limited amounts of APOBEC3G was significantly more infectious than Deltavif Deltavpr virus. In Addition, vpr(+) HIV-1 replicated more efficiently than vpr(-) virus in cells that expressed limited amounts of APOBEC3G. The findings highlight the importance of cytidine deamination in the virus replication cycle and present a novel function for Vpr."
15016877,Mitosis-specific hyperphosphorylation of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 suppresses its function.,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) is a key gene expressed in EBV type III latent infection that can transactivate numerous promoters, including those for all the other type III viral latency genes as well as cellular genes responsible for cell proliferation. EBNA-2 is essential for EBV-mediated immortalization of primary B lymphocytes. We now report that EBNA-2, a phosphoprotein, is hyperphosphorylated specifically in mitosis. Evidence that the cyclin-dependent kinase p34(cdc2) may be involved in this hyperphosphorylation includes (i) coimmunoprecipitation of EBNA-2 and p34(cdc2), suggesting physical association; (ii) temporal correlation between hyperphosphorylation of EBNA-2 and an increase in p34(cdc2) kinase activity; and (iii) ability of purified p34(cdc2)/cyclin B1 kinase to phosphorylate EBNA-2 in vitro. Hyperphosphorylation of EBNA-2 appears to suppress its ability to transactivate the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) promoter by about 50%. The association between EBNA-2 and PU.1 is also decreased by about 50% in M-phase-arrested cells, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation from cell lysates, suggesting that hyperphosphorylation of EBNA-2 impairs its affinity for PU.1. Finally, endogenous LMP-1 mRNA levels in M phase are around 55% of those in asynchronously growing cells. These results suggest that regulation of gene expression during type III latency may be regulated in a cell-cycle-related manner."
13679860,Interaction between HIV-1 Tat and pRb2/p130: a possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of AIDS-related neoplasms.,"Tat protein is an early nonstructural protein necessary for virus replication, which is secreted by infected cells and taken up by uninfected cells. Extensive evidence indicates that Tat may be a cofactor in the development of AIDS-related neoplasms. The molecular mechanism underlying Tat's oncogenic activity may include deregulation of cellular genes. Among these genes, it has recently been shown that pRb2/p130 oncosuppressor protein is one of the targets in the interaction between HIV gene product Tat and host proteins. However, whether the HIV-1 gene product Tat may inactivate the oncosuppressive function of pRb2/p130 has not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that mRNA levels of pRb2/p130 increase in the presence of Tat, whereas no change in the phosphorylation status of pRb2/p130 is observed. In addition, Tat can inhibit the growth control activity exerted by pRb2/p130 in the T98G cell line. Finally, Tat does not compete with E2F-4 in binding to pRb2/p130. The interaction between Tat and pRb2/p130 seems to result in the deregulation of the control exerted by pRb2/p130 on the cell cycle. Taken together, these results open a window on the role of pRb2/p130 in AIDS-related oncogenesis."
14978281,A single amino acid of APOBEC3G controls its species-specific interaction with virion infectivity factor (Vif).,"The virion infectivity factor (Vif) accessory protein of HIV-1 forms a complex with the cellular cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G) to block its antiviral activity. The antiviral property of APOBEC3G is conserved in several mammalian species, but the ability of Vif to block this activity is species-specific. HIV-1 Vif blocks human APOBEC3G but does not block the mouse or African green monkey (AGM) enzyme. Conversely, SIV(AGM) Vif blocks the antiviral activity of AGM but not human APOBEC3G. We demonstrate that the species specificity is caused by a single amino acid difference in APOBEC3G. Replacement of Asp-128 in human APOBEC3G with the Lys-128 of AGM APOBEC3G caused the enzyme to switch its interaction, becoming sensitive to SIV(AGM) Vif and resistant to HIV-1 Vif. Conversely, the reciprocal Lys to Asp switch in AGM APOBEC3G reversed its specificity for Vif. The reversal of biological activity was accompanied by the corresponding switch in the species specificity with which the enzyme physically associated with Vif and was excluded from virions. The charge of the amino acid at position 128 was a critical determinant of species specificity. Based on the crystal structure of the distantly related Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase, we propose that this amino acid is positioned on a solvent-exposed loop of APOBEC3G on the same face of the protein as the catalytic site."
7666522,Chimeric proteins composed of Jun and CREB define domains required for interaction with the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein.,"The regulation of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) long terminal repeat gene expression is dependent on three cis-acting elements known as 21-bp repeats and the transactivator protein Tax. Mutagenesis has demonstrated that sequences in each of the 21-bp repeats can be divided into three domains designated A, B, and C. Tax stimulates the binding of CREB to the B domain, which is essential for Tax activation of HTLV-1 gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that Tax will stimulate the binding of CREB to the HTLV-1 21-bp repeats but does not stimulate CREB binding to the consensus cyclic AMP response element (CRE) element found in the somatostatin promoter. However, Tax stimulates CREB binding to a consensus CRE in the context of the 21-bp repeats, indicating the importance of these sequences in stimulating CREB binding. To determine the mechanism by which Tax stimulates CREB binding and determine potential interactions between Tax and CREB, we used the mammalian two-hybrid system in conjunction with in vitro binding and gel retardation assays. Two-hybrid analysis indicated that mutations in either the basic or leucine zipper region of CREB prevented interactions with Tax. Since several studies have demonstrated that Tax will also stimulate the binding of a variety of different basic region-leucine zipper proteins to their cognate binding sites, we assayed whether chimeric proteins composed of portions of CREB and another basic region-leucine zipper protein, Jun, could be used to map domains required for interactions with Tax. These studies were possible because we did not detect in vivo or in vitro interactions between Tax and Jun. The amino acid sequence of the CREB basic region and a portion of its leucine zipper were required for both in vivo and in vitro interactions with Tax and increased binding of CREB to the 21-bp repeats in response to Tax. These studies define the domains in CREB required for both in vivo and in vitro interactions by the HTLV-1 Tax protein."
15483243,Vpx proteins of SIVmac239 and HIV-2ROD interact with the cytoskeletal protein alpha-actinin 1.,"vpx genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and immunodeficiency viruses from macaques (SIVmac), sooty mangabeys (SIVsm) and red-capped mangabeys (SIVrcm) encode a 112 aa protein that is packed into virion particles via interaction with the p6 domain of p55(gag). Vpx localizes to the nucleus when expressed in the absence of other viral proteins. Moreover, Vpx is necessary for efficient nuclear import of the pre-integration complex (PIC) and critical for virus replication in quiescent cells, such as terminally differentiated macrophages and memory T cells. Vpx does not contain sequence elements that are homologous to previously characterized nuclear localization signals (NLSs). Therefore, it is likely that Vpx-dependent import of the PIC is mediated by interaction of Vpx with cellular proteins that do not belong to the classical import pathways. By using a yeast two-hybrid screen, alpha-actinin 1, a cytoskeletal protein, was identified to interact with SIVmac239 Vpx. Interestingly, deletion of the proline-rich C-terminal domain (aa 101-112) of Vpx, which is important for nuclear localization, resulted in loss of interaction with alpha-actinin 1. These findings suggest that the interaction with alpha-actinin 1 may play an important role in the transport of Vpx to the nucleus and in Vpx-mediated nuclear import of the PIC."
11024139,Interaction of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP) with HS1-associated protein X-1: implication of cytoplasmic function of EBNA-LP.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP) consists of W1W2 repeats and a unique C-terminal Y1Y2 domain and has been suggested to play an important role in EBV-induced transformation. To identify the cellular factors interacting with EBNA-LP, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen, using EBNA-LP cDNA containing four W1W2 repeats as bait and an EBV-transformed human peripheral blood lymphocyte cDNA library as the source of cellular genes. Our results were as follows. (i) All three cDNAs in positive yeast colonies were found to encode the same cellular protein, HS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), which is localized mainly in the cytoplasm and has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of B-cell signal transduction and apoptosis. (ii) Mutational analysis of EBNA-LP revealed that the association with HAX-1 is mediated by the W1W2 repeat domain. (iii) A purified chimeric protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase fused to EBNA-LP specifically formed complexes with HAX-1 transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. (iv) When EBNA-LP and HAX-1 were coexpressed in COS-7 cells, EBNA-LP was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with HAX-1. (v) Careful cell fractionation experiments of an EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell line revealed that EBNA-LP is localized in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. (vi) When EBNA-LP containing four W1W2 repeats was expressed in COS-7 cells, EBNA-LP was detected mainly in the nucleus by immunofluorescence assay. Interestingly, when EBNA-LP containing a single W1W2 repeat was expressed in COS-7 cells, EBNA-LP was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and was colocalized with HAX-1. These results indicate that EBNA-LP is in fact present and may have a significant function in the cytoplasm, possibly by interacting with and affecting the function of HAX-1."
14963148,Vaccinia virus A36R membrane protein provides a direct link between intracellular enveloped virions and the microtubule motor kinesin.,"Previous work demonstrated that intracellular enveloped vaccinia virus virions use microtubules to move from the site of membrane wrapping to the cell periphery. The mechanism and direction of intracellular virion movement predicted that viral proteins directly or indirectly interact with the microtubule motor protein kinesin. The yeast two-hybrid assay was used to test for interactions between the light chain of kinesin and the cytoplasmic tails from five viral envelope proteins. We found that the N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat region of the kinesin light chain (KLC-TPR) interacted with the cytoplasmic tail of the viral A36R protein. A series of C- and N-terminal truncations of A36R further defined a region from residues 81 to 111 that was sufficient for interaction with KLC-TPR. Interactions were confirmed by using pull-down assays with purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-A36R and (35)S-labeled KLC-TPR. The defined region on A36R for interaction with kinesin overlaps the recently defined region (residues 91 to 111) for interaction with the A33R envelope protein. The yeast three-hybrid system was used to demonstrate that expression of A33R interrupted the interaction between A36R and KLC-TPR, indicating that the binding of A36R is mutually exclusive to either A33R or kinesin. Pull-down assays with purified GST-A36R and (35)S-labeled KLC-TPR in the presence of competing A33R corroborated these findings. Collectively, these results demonstrated that the viral A36R protein interacts directly with the microtubule motor protein kinesin and that the viral protein A33R may regulate this interaction."
14671118,EBNA3C coactivation with EBNA2 requires a SUMO homology domain.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is critical for EBV immortalization of infected B lymphocytes and can coactivate the EBV LMP1 promoter with EBNA2. EBNA3C amino acids 365 to 545 are necessary and sufficient for coactivation and are required for SUMO-1 and SUMO-3 interaction. We found that EBNA3C but not EBNA3CDelta343-545 colocalized with SUMO-1 in nuclear bodies and was modified by SUMO-2, SUMO-3, and SUMO-1. EBNA3C amino acids 545 to 628 and amino acids 30 to 365 were also required for EBNA3C sumolation and nuclear body localization but were dispensable for coactivation, indicating that EBNA3C sumolation is not required for coactivation. Furthermore, EBNA3C amino acids 476 to 992 potently coactivated with EBNA2 but EBNA3C amino acids 516 to 922 lacked activity, indicating that amino acids 476 to 515 are critical for coactivation. EBNA3C amino acids 476 to 515 include DDDVIEV(507-513), which are similar to SUMO-1 EEDVIEV(84-90). EBNA3C m1 and m2 point mutations, DDD(507-509) mutated to AAA and DVIEVID(509-513) mutated to AVIAVIA, respectively, diminished SUMO-1 and SUMO-3 interaction in directed yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays. Furthermore, EBNA3C m1 and m2 did not coactivate the LMP1 promoter with EBNA2. Overexpression of wild-type SUMO-1, SUMO-3, and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 coactivated the LMP1 promoter with EBNA2. Since EBNA2 activation is dependent on p300/CBP, the possible effect of EBNA3C on p300-mediated transcription was assayed. EBNA3C potentiated transcription of p300 fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain, whereas EBNA3C m1 and m2 did not. All of these data are consistent with a model in which EBNA3C upregulates EBNA2-mediated gene activation by binding to a sumolated repressor and inhibiting repressive effects on p300/CBP and other transcription factor(s) at EBNA2-regulated promoters."
17005681,Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 enhances transcriptional activity of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 long terminal repeat through direct interaction with Tax.,"In this study, we demonstrate that the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), which methylates histone H3 and other proteins such as p300/CBP, is positively involved in the regulation of Tax transactivation. First, transfection studies demonstrated that overexpression of CARM1 wild-type protein resulted in increased Tax transactivation of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). In contrast, transfection of a catalytically inactive CARM1 methyltransferase mutant did not enhance Tax transactivation. CARM1 facilitated Tax transactivation of the CREB-dependent cellular GEM promoter. A direct physical interaction between HTLV-1 Tax and CARM1 was demonstrated using in vitro glutathione S-transferase-Tax binding assays, in vivo coimmunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy experiments. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the activated HTLV-1 LTR promoter showed the association of CARM1 and methylated histone H3 with the template DNA. In vitro, Tax facilitates the binding of CARM1 to the transcription complex. Together, our data provide evidence that CARM1 enhances Tax transactivation of the HTLV-1 LTR through a direct interaction between CARM1 and Tax and this binding promotes methylation of histone H3 (R2, R17, and R26)."
18256157,The E6 oncoproteins from human betapapillomaviruses differentially activate telomerase through an E6AP-dependent mechanism and prolong the lifespan of primary keratinocytes.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) belonging to the Betapapillomavirus genus have recently been implicated in squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, though the mechanisms by which they initiate carcinogenesis are unclear. We show that human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) expressing several betapapillomavirus E6 (beta-E6) proteins display life span extension, but not to the extent seen in HFKs expressing HPV type 16 E6 (16E6). Additionally, we demonstrate that beta-E6 proteins can differentially activate telomerase. HFKs expressing 38E6 exhibit significant telomerase activity but to a lesser degree than that observed with 16E6; however, other beta-E6 proteins, including 5E6, 8E6, 20E6, and 22E6, exhibit low or background levels of telomerase activity. Utilizing glutathione S-transferase pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, the beta-E6 proteins were shown to interact with the cellular proteins E6-associated protein (E6AP) and NFX1-91, two proteins known to be important for telomerase activation by 16E6. Interestingly, the relative strength of the interaction between E6 and E6AP or NFX1-91 was proportionate to the activation of telomerase by each beta-E6 protein. To address the requirement for E6AP in telomerase activation by beta-E6 proteins, we utilized a shRNA to knock down endogenous levels of E6AP. Lysates with decreased levels of E6AP showed a reduced ability to activate telomerase, suggesting that E6AP is a necessary component. These data suggest that complex formation between E6, E6AP, and NFX1-91 is a critical step in mediating telomerase activation, which may be one contributing factor to cellular life span extension during human betapapillomavirus infection."
16873253,Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus latent protein LANA interacts with HIF-1 alpha to upregulate RTA expression during hypoxia: Latency control under low oxygen conditions.,"Hypoxia can induce lytic replication of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells. However, the molecular mechanism of lytic reactivation of KSHV by hypoxia remains unclear. Here we show that the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which plays a crucial role in modulating viral and cellular gene expression, directly associated with a low oxygen responder, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). LANA enhanced not only the transcriptional activities of HIF-1 alpha but also its mRNA level. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies documented a physical interaction between LANA and HIF-1 alpha in transiently transfected 293T cells as well as in PEL cell lines during hypoxia. Through sequence analysis, several putative hypoxia response elements (HRE-1 to -6) were identified in the essential lytic gene Rta promoter. Reporter assays showed that HRE-2 (-1130 to -1123) and HRE-5 and HRE-6 (+234 to +241 and +812 to +820, respectively, within the intron sequence) were necessary and sufficient for the LANA-mediated HIF-1 alpha response. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed HIF-1 alpha-dependent binding of a LANA protein complex specifically to the HRE-2, -5, and -6 motifs within the promoter regulatory sequences. This study demonstrates that hypoxia-induced KSHV lytic replication is mediated at least in part through cooperation of HIF-1 alpha with LANA bound to the HRE motifs of the Rta promoter."
16528029,"Yaba-like disease virus chemokine receptor 7L, a CCR8 orthologue.","Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV) gene 7L encodes a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor with 53 % amino acid identity to human CC chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8). Initial characterization of 7L showed that this 56 kDa cell-surface glycoprotein binds human CCL1 with high affinity (Kd=0.6 nM) and induces signal transduction by activation of heterotrimeric G proteins and downstream protein kinases. Further characterization of YLDV 7L is presented here and shows that murine CC chemokines can induce G-protein activation via the 7L receptor, despite having a low binding affinity for this receptor. In addition, when expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus (VACV), YLDV 7L was found on the outer envelope of VACV extracellular enveloped virus. The contribution of 7L to poxvirus pathogenesis was investigated by infection of mice with a recombinant VACV expressing 7L (vDeltaB8R-7L) and was compared with the outcome of infection by parental and revertant control viruses. In both intranasal and intradermal models, expression of 7L caused attenuation of VACV. The role of this protein in viral virulence is discussed."
11264386,Nef-induced CD4 downregulation: a diacidic sequence in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef does not function as a protein sorting motif through direct binding to beta-COP.,"The Nef protein from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induces CD4 cell surface downregulation by interfering with the endocytic machinery. It has been recently proposed that binding of HIV type 1 Nef to the beta subunit of COPI coatomers participated in the Nef-induced CD4 downregulation through recognition of a novel diacidic motif found in the C-terminal disordered loop of Nef (V. Piguet, F. Gu, M. Foti, N. Demaurex, J. Gruenberg, J. L. Carpentier, and D. Trono, Cell 97:63-73, 1999). We have mutated the glutamate residues which formed this motif in order to document this observation. Surprisingly, mutation of the diacidic sequence of Nef did not significantly affect its ability (i) to interact with beta-COP, (ii) to downregulate CD4 cell surface expression, and (iii) to address an integral resident membrane protein containing Nef as the cytoplasmic domain to the endocytic pathway. Our results indicate that these acidic residues are not involved in the connection of Nef with the endocytic machinery through binding to beta-COP. Additional studies are thus required to characterize the residues of Nef involved in the binding to beta-COP and to evaluate the contribution of this interaction to the Nef-induced perturbations of membrane trafficking."
7966229,Cell type-dependence for Vpu function.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu has been shown to facilitate virus release from HeLa cells. We demonstrated that Vpu expression is not required for efficient virus release from Cos 1 and CV-1 cells. A yeast GAL4 transcriptional activation system was used to screen for cellular proteins that may interact with Vpu. One such protein was identified which we provisionally designate ""Vpu interactive protein"" or VIP."
9656992,Nef proteins of distinct HIV-1 or -2 isolates differ in their binding properties for HCK: isolation of a novel Nef binding factor with characteristics of an adaptor protein.,"The Nef gene of the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses HIV and SIV has been implicated in pathogenicity; however, the mechanism by which Nef induces disease is still unknown. An impact on signal transduction in cells has been suggested by the interaction of Nef from an HIV-1 strain and tyrosine kinases like HCK and LCK as well as serine/threonine kinases. We have confirmed the binding of HCK to HIV-1 subtype B Nef and demonstrated an equally strong interaction with a subtype E Nef protein but weaker binding to Nef of HIV-2 subtype A (HIV-2D194). No binding, however, was observed to HIV-2 subtype B Nef (HIV-2D205). Instead, this protein bound to a novel cellular protein, Nefin 1, with characteristics of an adaptor protein and strong expression in all human hematopoietic tissues. Nefin 1 binds through an amino-terminal domain, which is related to SH3 domains. For interaction of Nef with Nefin 1, the PxxP motif and the three-dimensional conformation of the molecule appear necessary. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Nef proteins of divergent strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2 may use different elements of signal transduction pathways for the induction of pathogenicity in vivo."
8668529,Identification of the structural and functional human homolog of the yeast ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBC9.,"Ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (UBCs) are a family of proteins directly involved in ubiquitination of proteins. Ubiquitination is known to be involved in control of a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, through the targeting of key regulatory proteins for degradation. The ubc9 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Scubc9) is an essential gene which is required for cell cycle progression and is involved in the degradation of S phase and M phase cyclins. We have identified a human homolog of Scubc9 (termed hubc9) using the two hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the human papillomavirus type 16 E1 replication protein. The hubc9 encoded protein shares a very high degree of amino acid sequence similarity with ScUBC9 and with the homologous hus5+ gene product of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Genetic complementation experiments in a S.cerevisiae ubc9ts mutant reveal that hUBC9 can substitute for the function of ScUBC9 required for cell cycle progression."
17959661,The antiapoptotic herpes simplex virus glycoprotein J localizes to multiple cellular organelles and induces reactive oxygen species formation.,"The Us5 gene of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encodes glycoprotein J (gJ). The only previously reported function of gJ was its ability to inhibit apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which gJ prevents apoptosis is not understood, and it is not known whether gJ mediates additional cellular effects. In this study, we evaluated the expression, localization, and cellular effects of Us5/gJ. Us5 was first expressed 4 h after infection. gJ was detectable at 6 h and was expressed in glycosylated and unglycosylated forms. Us5 was regulated as a late gene, with partial dependency on DNA replication for expression. Us5 expression was delayed in the absence of ICP22; furthermore, expression of Us5 in trans protected cells from apoptosis induced by an HSV mutant with deletion of ICP27, suggesting that the antiapoptotic effects of ICP22 and ICP27 are mediated in part through effects on gJ expression. Within HSV-infected or Us5-transfected cells, gJ was distributed widely, especially to the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, and early endosomes. gJ interacted with F(o)F(1) ATP synthase subunit 6 by a yeast two-hybrid screen and had strong antiapoptotic effects, which were mediated by protein rather than mRNA. Antiapoptotic activity required the extracellular and transmembrane domains of gJ, but not the intracellular domain. Consistent with inhibition of F(o)F(1) ATP synthase function, Us5 was required for HSV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and gJ was sufficient to induce ROS in Us5-transfected cells. Thus, HSV gJ is a multifunctional protein, modulating other cellular processes in addition to inhibition of apoptosis."
9037025,Death effector domain-containing herpesvirus and poxvirus proteins inhibit both Fas- and TNFR1-induced apoptosis.,"To identify novel antiapoptotic proteins encoded by DNA viruses, we searched viral genomes for proteins that might interfere with Fas and TNFR1 apoptotic signaling pathways. We report here that equine herpesvirus type 2 E8 protein and molluscum contagiosum virus MC159 protein both show sequence similarity to the death effector domains (DEDs) of the Fas/TNFR1 signaling components FADD and caspase-8. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that E8 protein interacted with the caspase-8 prodomain whereas MC159 protein interacted with FADD. Furthermore, expression of either E8 protein or MC159 protein protected cells from Fas- and TNFR1-induced apoptosis indicating that certain herpesviruses and poxviruses use DED-mediated interactions to interfere with apoptotic signaling pathways. These findings identify a novel control point exploited by viruses to regulate Fas- and TNFR1-mediated apoptosis."
8676443,A conserved domain of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigens 3A and 3C binds to a discrete domain of Jkappa.,"EBNA-3C can affect the LMP-1 promoter in both a positive and a negative manner through distinct DNA sequence elements. The viral transactivator EBNA-2 normally binds DNA indirectly via Jkappa to activate transcription, but this activation is prevented in the presence of EBNA-3C. The DNA element recognized by Jkappa is both required and sufficient for this inhibition. Jkappa clones isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen using EBNA-3C as bait allowed us to delineate the sequences of both proteins mediating the interaction. Two isoforms of Jkappa that differ in exon 1, Jkappa-1 and RBP-2N, interact with EBNA-3C, suggesting that exon 1 is not required for this interaction; indeed, clones with deletion of the N-terminal third of Jkappa interacted as efficiently with EBNA-3C as full-length Jkappa clones. A Jkappa domain as small as 56 amino acids was sufficient to bind to EBNA-3C. A 74-amino-acid domain of EBNA-3C, conserved in all three EBNA-3 family members, was sufficient to interact with Jkappa. A specific mutation in this conserved domain suppressed the ability of EBNA-3C to downregulate transcription. Accordingly, EBNA-3A was also able to interact with Jkappa and downregulate Jkappa-mediated transcription as efficiently as EBNA-3C. The ability of the EBNA-3 proteins to prevent Jkappa from binding to DNA in vitro and suppress transactivation via Jkappa DNA elements suggests that the EBNA-3 proteins act analogously to the Drosophila protein Hairless."
9435256,Specific interaction of HTLV tax protein and a human type IV neuronal intermediate filament protein.,"The human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) is associated with adult T cell leukemia and neurological disorders (TSP/HAM). The HTLV transcriptional transactivator, Tax, is known to exert its effect through protein-protein interaction with several transcription factors that activate genes in T cell proliferation. The pathogenic mechanism in the CNS is less defined. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a specific Tax-binding protein as the neuronal specific intermediate filament protein, alpha-internexin. Tax binds to the domain corresponding to the rod region of alpha-internexin, which is essential for neurofilament assembly. The Tax domains involved in binding are separable from those involved in transactivation. TxBP-1/alpha-internexin and Tax are expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, when expressed alone, but in coexpressing cells, colocalization of both proteins was observed in a perinuclear, punctate distribution. This in vivo interaction also resulted in a dramatic reduction in Tax transactivation and the network formation by alpha-internexin. The specific interaction of Tax and a neuronal specific intermediate filament protein may provide a clue to the pathogenesis of TSP/HAM."
16158050,Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax attenuates gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis through physical interaction with Chk2.,"Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) is known to mediate diverse cellular responses to genotoxic stress. The fundamental role of Chk2 is to regulate the network of genome-surveillance pathways that coordinate cell-cycle progression with DNA repair and cell survival or death. Defects in Chk2 contribute to the development of both hereditary and sporadic human cancers. We now present evidence that the human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein directly interacts with Chk2 and the kinase activity of Chk2 is inhibited by Tax. The physical interaction of Chk2 and Tax was observed by co-immunoprecipitation assays in HTLV-1-infected T cells (C81) as well as GST pull-down assays using purified proteins. Binding and kinase activity inhibition studies with Tax deletion mutants indicated that at least two domains of Tax mediate the interaction with Chk2. We have analysed the functional consequence of de novo expression of Tax upon the cellular DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, which is mediated by Chk2. Using transient transfection and TUNEL assay, we found that gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis was decreased in 293T and HCT-116 (p53(-/-)) cells expressing HTLV-1 Tax. Our studies demonstrate an important potential target of Tax in cellular transformation."
15948258,Molecular epidemiological study on pre-X region of hepatitis B virus and identification of hepatocyte proteins interacting with whole-X protein by yeast two-hybrid.,"To identify the pre-X region in hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome and to study the relationship between the genotype and the pre-X region. To investigate the biological function of whole-X (pre-X plus X) protein, we performed yeast two-hybrid to screen proteins in liver interacting with whole-X protein."
9472622,"The identification of a conserved binding motif within human papillomavirus type 16 E6 binding peptides, E6AP and E6BP.","A 16-mer peptide library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid system to identify peptides which specifically interact with the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E6 protein. Four different peptides were identified, three of which contained an E-L-L/V-G motif. A fifth E6 binding peptide, derived from the putative tumour suppressor protein tuberin, was identified during a two-hybrid screen of a HeLa cDNA expression library. This peptide contained a D-I-L-G motif. Homology to the peptides was found within the E6 binding proteins E6-AP and E6-BP. A synthetic peptide containing the ELLG motif blocked the interaction of E6 with both E6-AP and E6-BP. The data suggest that E6 interacts through a structurally similar binding domain present within a number of cellular proteins."
11259200,Interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr with the HHR23A DNA repair protein does not correlate with multiple biological functions of Vpr.,"The virion-associated Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) alters cell cycle progression from the G2 phase, influences the virus in vivo mutation rate, and participates in the nuclear translocation of viral DNA. While many Vpr-interacting proteins have been identified, the functional relevance of these interactions remains to be thoroughly documented. We have explored the contribution of the interaction of HIV-1 Vpr with HHR23A, a cellular protein implicated in DNA repair, to the known phenotypes of Vpr. The association of Vpr with HHR23A required the core region of Vpr, which encompasses the two alpha-helical structures of the protein. No binding of HHR23A was detected with the Vpr and Vpx proteins of other primate lentiviruses. HIV-1 Vpr variants containing single amino acid substitutions in each alpha-helix and deficient for binding to HHR23A were isolated. The functional characterization of these Vpr variants indicated that binding to HHR23A did not correlate with the ability of Vpr to induce cell cycle arrest, even though it was previously proposed that HHR23A is a mediator of the Vpr-induced G2 arrest. Also, the Vpr-HHR23A interaction did not influence the HIV-1 in vivo mutation rate. Finally, Vpr and HHR23A are both localized in the nucleus, but no correlation was observed between the nuclear targeting of Vpr and the interaction with HHR23A. Further analysis is needed to determine the functional role(s) of the Vpr-HHR23A association during the HIV-1 life cycle."
9733829,Adeno-associated virus Rep78 protein interacts with protein kinase A and its homolog PRKX and inhibits CREB-dependent transcriptional activation.,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a human parvovirus of the genus Dependovirus. AAV replication is largely restricted to cells which are coinfected with a helper virus. In the absence of a helper virus, the AAV genome can integrate into a specific chromosomal site where it remains latent until reactivated by superinfection of the host cell with an appropriate helper virus. Replication functions of AAV have been mapped to the Rep68 and Rep78 gene products. Rep proteins demonstrate DNA binding, endonuclease, and helicase activities and are involved in regulation of transcription from both AAV and heterologous promoters. AAV has been associated with suppression of oncogenicity in a range of viral and nonviral tumors. In this study we sought to identify and study cellular protein targets of AAV Rep, in order to develop a better understanding of the various activities of Rep. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify HeLa cell proteins that interact with AAV type 2 Rep78. We isolated several strongly interacting clones which were subsequently identified as PRKX (previously named PKX1), a recently described homolog of the protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (PKAc). The interaction was confirmed in vitro by using pMal-Rep pull-down assays. The region of Rep78 which interacts was mapped to a C-terminal zinc finger-like domain; Rep68, which lacks this domain, did not interact with PRKX. PRKX demonstrated autophosphorylation and kinase activity towards histone H1 and a PKA oligopeptide target. Autophosphorylation was inhibited by interaction with Rep78. In transfection assays, a PRKX expression vector was shown to be capable of activating CREB-dependent transcription. This activation was suppressed by Rep78 but not by Rep68. Since PRKX is a close homolog of PKAc, we investigated whether Rep78 could interact directly with PKAc. pMal-Rep78 was found to associate with purified PKAc and inhibited its kinase activity. Cotransfection experiments demonstrated that Rep78 could block the activation of CREB by a PKAc expression vector. These experiments suggest that AAV may perturb normal cyclic AMP response pathways in infected cells."
9874563,The HIV-1 virion-associated protein vpr is a coactivator of the human glucocorticoid receptor.,"The HIV-1 virion-associated accessory protein Vpr affects both viral replication and cellular transcription, proliferation, and differentiation. We report that Vpr enhances the activity of glucocorticoids in lymphoid and muscle-derived cell lines by interacting directly with the glucocorticoid receptor and general transcription factors, acting as a coactivator. Vpr contains the signature motif LXXLL also present in cellular nuclear receptor coactivators, such as steroid receptor coactivator 1 and p300/CREB-binding protein, which mediates their interaction with the glucocorticoid and other nuclear hormone receptors. A mutant Vpr molecule with disruption of this coactivator signature motif lost its ability to influence transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes and became a dominant-negative inhibitor of Vpr, possibly by retaining its general transcription factor-binding activities. The glucocorticoid coactivator activity of Vpr may contribute to increased tissue glucocorticoid sensitivity in the absence of hypercortisolism and to the pathogenesis of AIDS."
16362936,Insights on HIV-1 Tat:P/CAF bromodomain molecular recognition from in vivo experiments and molecular dynamics simulations.,"Structural and functional studies indicate that, through its bromodomain, the cellular acetyltransferase P/CAF binds the acetylated Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and promotes transcriptional activation of the integrated provirus. Based on the NMR structure of P/CAF complexed with an acetylated Tat peptide, here we use molecular dynamics simulations to construct a model describing the interaction between full length Tat and the P/CAF bromodomain. Our calculations show that the protein-protein interface involves hydrophobic interactions between the P/CAF ZA loop and the Tat core domain. In particular, tyrosines 760 and 761 of P/CAF, two residues that are highly conserved in most known bromodomains, play an essential role for the binding. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments performed in this work demonstrate that P/CAF proteins in which these tyrosines are mutated into hydrophilic residues neither bind to Tat inside the cells nor mediate Tat transactivation. The combination of theoretical and in vivo studies provides new insights into the specificity of bromodomain recognition."
10547288,SH3 domains with high affinity and engineered ligand specificities targeted to HIV-1 Nef.,"The avid binding of HIV-1 Nef to the Src homology-3 (SH3) domain of Hck (KD 250 nM) has been shown to involve an interaction between the RT-loop of Hck-SH3 and residues in Nef outside of its prototypic polyproline type II (PPII) helix-containing SH3-ligand region. Such distinctive interactions are thought to provide specificity and affinity for other SH3/ligand protein complexes as well. Here, we have constructed and successfully displayed on the surface of M13 bacteriophage particles a complex library of SH3 domains, which are derived from Hck but carry a random hexapeptide substitution in their RT-loops (termed RRT-SH3). Using this strategy we have identified individual RRT-SH3 domains that can bind to Nef up to 40-fold more avidly than Hck-SH3. Some of these high-affinity RRT-SH3 domains resembled Hck-SH3 in that they bound much less well to a Nef variant containing an engineered F90R mutation that interferes with docking of the native Hck RT-loop. In addition, we could also select RRT-SH3 domains with an opposite specificity, which were dependent on the Arg90 residue for strong binding, and bound 100-fold less well to unmodified Nef. These results demonstrate the utility of phage-display in engineering of signaling protein interaction domains, and emphasize the importance of the RT-loop in SH3 ligand selection, thus suggesting a general strategy for creating SH3 domains with desired binding properties."
12226087,Identification of Hsp90 as a stimulatory host factor involved in influenza virus RNA synthesis.,"Efficient transcription and replication of the influenza virus genome are dependent upon host-derived factors. Using an in vitro RNA synthesis system, we have purified and identified Hsp90 as one of the host factors that stimulate viral RNA polymerase activity. Hsp90 interacted with the PB2 subunit of the viral RNA polymerase through the amino-terminal chaperone domain and the middle region containing a highly acidic domain. The acidic middle region was also responsible for its stimulatory activity. We found that a portion of Hsp90 is re-localized to the cell nucleus after viral infection. A PB2 fragment containing a Hsp90 binding domain inhibited viral gene expression in a dominant-negative manner. These results suggest that Hsp90 is a host factor for the influenza virus RNA polymerase."
2017166,Specific complex of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 rev and nucleolar B23 proteins: dissociation by the Rev response element.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) Rev protein is thought to be involved in the export of unspliced or singly spliced viral mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This function is mediated by a sequence-specific interaction with a cis-acting RNA element, the Rev response element (RRE), present in these intron-containing RNAs. To identify possible host proteins involved in Rev function, we fractionated nuclear cell extracts with a Rev affinity column. A single, tightly associated Rev-binding protein was identified; this protein is the mammalian nucleolar protein B23. The interaction between HIV Rev and B23 is very specific, as it was observed in complex cell extracts. The complex is also very stable toward dissociation by high salt concentrations. Despite the stability of the Rev-B23 protein complex, the addition of RRE, but not control RNA, led to the displacement of B23 and the formation of a specific Rev-RRE complex. The mammalian nucleolar protein B23 or its amphibian counterpart No38 is believed to function as a shuttle receptor for the nuclear import of ribosomal proteins. B23 may also serve as a shuttle for the import of HIV Rev from the cytoplasm into the nucleus or nucleolus to allow further rounds of export of RRE-containing viral RNAs."
10196275,"A novel cellular protein, p60, interacting with both herpes simplex virus 1 regulatory proteins ICP22 and ICP0 is modified in a cell-type-specific manner and Is recruited to the nucleus after infection.","Herpes simplex virus 1 encodes two multifunctional regulatory proteins, infected-cell proteins 22 and 0 (ICP22 and ICP0). ICP0 is a promiscuous transactivator, whereas ICP22 is required in vivo and for efficient replication and expression of a subset of late (gamma2) genes in rodent or rabbit cell lines and in primary human cell strains (restrictive cells) but not in HEp-2 or Vero (permissive) cells. We report the identification in the yeast two-hybrid system of a cellular protein designated p60 that interacts with ICP22. This protein (apparent Mr of 60,000) has not been previously described and has no known motifs. Analyses of p60 revealed the following. (i) p60 bound fast-migrating, underprocessed wild-type ICP22 and ICP22 lacking the carboxyl-terminal 24 amino acids but not ICP22 lacking the carboxyl-terminal 40 amino acids, whereas the previously identified cellular protein p78 (R. Bruni and B. Roizman, J. Virol. 72:8525-8531, 1998) bound all forms of ICP22. The interaction of p60 with only one isoform of ICP22 supports that hypothesis that each isoform of herpes simplex virus proteins performs a specific function that may be different from that of other isoforms. (ii) p60 also bound ICP0; the binding of ICP0 was independent of that of ICP22. (iii) p60 localized in uninfected rabbit skin cells in both nuclei and cytoplasm. In rabbit skin cells infected with wild-type virus, p60 was posttranslationally processed to a higher apparent Mr but was not redistributed. Posttranslational processing required the presence of the genes encoding ICP22 and UL13 protein kinase. (iv) In uninfected HEp-2 cells, p60 localized primarily in nuclei. Soon after infection with wild-type virus, the p60 localized in discrete small nuclear structures with ICP0. Late in infection, both ICP0 and p60 tended to disperse but p60 did not change in apparent Mr. The localization of p60 was independent of ICP22, but p60 tended to be more localized in small nuclear structures and less dispersed in cells infected with mutants lacking the genes encoding the UL13 or US3 protein kinases. The results suggest that posttranslational modification of p60 is mediated either by ICP0 (permissive cells) or by ICP22 and UL13 protein kinase (restrictive rabbit skin cells) and that the restrictive phenotype of rabbit skin cells may be related to the failure to process p60 by mutants lacking the genes encoding UL13 or ICP22."
11160689,Cellular splicing factor RAF-2p48/NPI-5/BAT1/UAP56 interacts with the influenza virus nucleoprotein and enhances viral RNA synthesis.,"Previous biochemical data identified a host cell fraction, designated RAF-2, which stimulated influenza virus RNA synthesis. A 48-kDa polypeptide (RAF-2p48), a cellular splicing factor belonging to the DEAD-box family of RNA-dependent ATPases previously designated BAT1 (also UAP56), has now been identified as essential for RAF-2 stimulatory activity. Additionally, RAF-2p48 was independently identified as an influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP)-interacting protein, NPI-5, in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mammalian cDNA library. In vitro, RAF-2p48 interacted with free NP but not with NP bound to RNA, and the RAF-2p48-NP complex was dissociated following addition of free RNA. Furthermore, RAF-2p48 facilitated formation of the NP-RNA complexes that likely serve as templates for the viral RNA polymerase. RAF-2p48 was shown, in both in vitro binding assays and the yeast two-hybrid system, to bind to the amino-terminal region of NP, a domain essential for RNA binding. Together, these observations suggest that RAF-2p48 facilitates NP-RNA interaction, thus leading to enhanced influenza virus RNA synthesis."
17383430,Pin1 interacts with a specific serine-proline motif of hepatitis B virus X-protein to enhance hepatocarcinogenesis.,"The peptidyl prolyl isomerase Pin1 frequently is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most common etiologic agent in HCC, and its encoded X-protein (HBx) is oncogenic and possesses a serine-proline motif that may bind Pin1. The role of Pin1 in hepatocarcinogenesis, particularly in HBV-related HCC, was investigated."
10567539,PCAF interacts with tax and stimulates tax transactivation in a histone acetyltransferase-independent manner.,"Recent studies have shown that the p300/CREB binding protein (CBP)-associated factor (PCAF) is involved in transcriptional activation. PCAF activity has been shown strongly associated with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. In this report, we present evidence for a HAT-independent transcription function that is activated in the presence of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein. In vitro and in vivo GST-Tax pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that there is a direct interaction between Tax and PCAF, independent of p300/CBP. PCAF can be recruited to the HTLV-1 Tax responsive element in the presence of Tax, and PCAF cooperates with Tax in vivo to activate transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR over 10-fold. Point mutations at Tax amino acid 318 (TaxS318A) or 319 to 320 (Tax M47), which have decreased or no activity on the HTLV-1 promoter, are defective for PCAF binding. Strikingly, the ability of PCAF to stimulate Tax transactivation is not solely dependent on the PCAF HAT domain. Two independent PCAF HAT mutants, which knock out acetyltransferase enzyme activity, activate Tax transactivation to approximately the same level as wild-type PCAF. In contrast, p300 stimulation of Tax transactivation is HAT dependent. These studies provide experimental evidence that PCAF contains a coactivator transcription function independent of the HAT activity on the viral long terminal repeat."
16477309,Two key residues in ephrinB3 are critical for its use as an alternative receptor for Nipah virus.,"EphrinB2 was recently discovered as a functional receptor for Nipah virus (NiV), a lethal emerging paramyxovirus. Ephrins constitute a class of homologous ligands for the Eph class of receptor tyrosine kinases and exhibit overlapping expression patterns. Thus, we examined whether other ephrins might serve as alternative receptors for NiV. Here, we show that of all known ephrins (ephrinA1-A5 and ephrinB1-B3), only the soluble Fc-fusion proteins of ephrinB3, in addition to ephrinB2, bound to soluble NiV attachment protein G (NiV-G). Soluble NiV-G bound to cell surface ephrinB3 and B2 with subnanomolar affinities (Kd = 0.58 nM and 0.06 nM for ephrinB3 and B2, respectively). Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that the relatively lower affinity of NiV-G for ephrinB3 was largely due to a faster off-rate (K(off) = 1.94 x 10(-3) s(-1) versus 1.06 x 10(-4) s(-1) for ephrinB3 and B2, respectively). EphrinB3 was sufficient to allow for viral entry of both pseudotype and live NiV. Soluble ephrinB2 and B3 were able to compete for NiV-envelope-mediated viral entry on both ephrinB2- and B3-expressing cells, suggesting that NiV-G interacts with both ephrinB2 and B3 via an overlapping site. Mutational analysis indicated that the Leu-Trp residues in the solvent exposed G-H loop of ephrinB2 and B3 were critical determinants of NiV binding and entry. Indeed, replacement of the Tyr-Met residues in the homologous positions in ephrinB1 with Leu-Trp conferred NiV receptor activity to ephrinB1. Thus, ephrinB3 is a bona fide alternate receptor for NiV entry, and two residues in the G-H loop of the ephrin B-class ligands are critical determinants of NiV receptor activity."
10381170,HTLV type I Tax activation of the CXCR4 promoter by association with nuclear respiratory factor 1.,"Human T lymphotropic virus type I trans-activator Tax protein regulates expression of several cellular genes that are involved in cellular activation, proliferation, and transformation. Tax mediates its regulatory activity through interaction with cellular transcription factors such as members of the cAMP-responsive element-binding factors/ATF family or the NF-kappaB/Rel family. In this study we have demonstrated that Tax trans-activates the promoter for CXCR4, a coreceptor for T cell-tropic HIV-1 through its association with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1). The promoter region for CXCR4 contains an NRF1-binding site, which is crucial for basal and Tax-induced activity. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments showed association of GST-Tax fusion protein with NRF1 in vitro. Expression of Tax, in addition to stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin, increased formation of the NRF1 complex in a gel-mobility shift assay, indicating that Tax association with NRF1 in vivo facilitates its DNA binding. HTLV-I Tax activation of CXCR4 may contribute to the rapid progression of HIV disease observed in certain coinfected individuals."
15737233,Phosphorylation of HIV Tat by PKR increases interaction with TAR RNA and enhances transcription.,"The interferon (IFN)-induced, dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase, PKR, plays a key regulatory role in the IFN-mediated anti-viral response by blocking translation in the infected cell by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of elongation factor 2 (eIF2). The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evades the anti-viral IFN response through the binding of one of its major transcriptional regulatory proteins, Tat, to PKR. HIV-1 Tat acts as a substrate homologue for the enzyme, competing with eIF2alpha, and inhibiting the translational block. It has been shown that during the interaction with PKR, Tat becomes phosphorylated at three residues: serine 62, threonine 64 and serine 68. We have investigated the effect of this phosphorylation on the function of Tat in viral transcription. HIV-1 Tat activates transcription elongation by first binding to TAR RNA, a stem-loop structure found at the 5' end of all viral transcripts. Our results showed faster, greater and stronger binding of Tat to TAR RNA after phosphorylation by PKR."
16807369,Interaction of HIV Tat and matrix metalloproteinase in HIV neuropathogenesis: a new host defense mechanism.,"Tat, the HIV transactivating protein, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of extracellular matrix (ECM) endopeptidases, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated dementia. However, the possibility that MMPs interact with viral proteins has remained unexplored. We therefore treated mixed human fetal neuronal cultures with recombinant Tat and select MMPs. Neurotoxicity was determined by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential and neuronal cell death. Previous studies have shown that Tat and MMP independently cause neurotoxicity. Surprisingly, we found the combination of Tat and MMP produced significant attenuation of neurotoxicity. To determine whether there was a physical interaction between Tat and MMP, we used protein electrophoresis and Western blot techniques, and found that MMP-1 can degrade Tat. This effect was blocked by MMP inhibitors. Furthermore, MMP-1 decreased Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV long terminal repeat region, and this functionality was restored when MMP-1 activity was inhibited. These results suggest that the decrease in Tat-induced neurotoxicity and HIV transactivation is due to Tat's enzymatic cleavage by MMP-1. The direct interaction of human MMPs with viral proteins has now been demonstrated, with resultant modulation of Tat-mediated neurotoxicity and transactivation. This study elucidates a unique viral-host interaction that may serve as an innate host defense mechanism."
8637577,Inactivation of p27Kip1 by the viral E1A oncoprotein in TGFbeta-treated cells.,"The adenovirus oncoprotein E1A and the simian virus SV40 large T antigen can both reverse the strong growth-inhibitory effect of transforming growth factor(TGF)-beta on mink lung epithelial cells: exposure of TGF-beta causes these cells to arrest late in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (ref. 3). This arrest correlates with an increase in expression of the protein p15Ink4B (ref. 4), inactivation of the cyclin E/A-cdk2 complex by the inhibitory protein p27Kip1 (refs 5-7), and with the accumulation of unphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. The rescue by E1A of cells from TGF-beta arrest is partly independent of its binding to retinoblastoma protein. Here we show that E1A directly affects the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 in TGF-beta-treated cells by binding to it and blocking its inhibitory effect, thereby restoring the activity of the cyclin-cdk2 kinase complex. In this way, E1A can overcome the effect of TGF-beta and modulate the cell cycle. To our knowledge, E1A provides the first example of a viral oncoprotein that can disable a cellular protein whose function is to inhibit the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases."
10393900,Recruitment of cyclin T1/P-TEFb to an HIV type 1 long terminal repeat promoter proximal RNA target is both necessary and sufficient for full activation of transcription.,"Transcriptional activation of the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter element by the viral Tat protein is an essential step in the HIV-1 life cycle. Tat function is mediated by the TAR RNA target element encoded within the LTR and is known to require the recruitment of a complex consisting of Tat and the cyclin T1 (CycT1) component of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to TAR. Here, we demonstrate that both TAR and Tat become entirely dispensable for activation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter when CycT1/P-TEFb is artificially recruited to a heterologous promoter proximal RNA target. The level of activation observed was indistinguishable from the level induced by Tat and was neither inhibited nor increased when Tat was expressed in trans. Activation by artificially recruited CycT1 depended on the ability to bind the CDK9 component of P-TEFb. In contrast, although binding to both Tat and TAR was essential for the ability of CycT1 to act as a Tat cofactor, these interactions became dispensable when CycT1 was directly recruited to the LTR. Importantly, activation of the LTR both by Tat and by directly recruited CycT1 was found to be at the level of transcription elongation. Together, these data demonstrate that recruitment of CycT1/P-TEFb to the HIV-1 LTR is fully sufficient to activate this promoter element and imply that the sole role of the Tat/TAR axis in viral transcription is to permit the recruitment of CycT1/P-TEFb."
9680131,Adenovirus core protein V interacts with p32--a protein which is associated with both the mitochondria and the nucleus.,"Adenovirus protein V is associated with the DNA-containing virus core and functions as a bridge between the capsid and the core. A yeast two-hybrid analysis performed with a human cDNA library using protein V as 'bait' selected a cellular protein, p32 --described previously as associated with the splicing factor ASF/SF2. By expression and purification of p32 and preparation of an antibody we confirmed the binding of p32 to V by a variety of methods including immune precipitation. We demonstrated that p32 was primarily located in the cytoplasm in association with mitochondria but could also be detected in the nucleus as distinct granules and tubules. By examining infected cells using confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence we were able to follow the intracellular locations of protein V and p32 and it is postulated that p32 is part of a system which imports proteins to the nucleus and that adenovirus hijacks this process to deliver its genome to the nucleus."
16014927,mRNA decay during herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections: protein-protein interactions involving the HSV virion host shutoff protein and translation factors eIF4H and eIF4A.,"During lytic infections, the virion host shutoff (Vhs) protein of herpes simplex virus accelerates the degradation of both host and viral mRNAs. In so doing, it helps redirect the cell from host to viral protein synthesis and facilitates the sequential expression of different viral genes. Vhs interacts with the cellular translation initiation factor eIF4H, and several point mutations that abolish its mRNA degradative activity also abrogate its ability to bind eIF4H. In addition, a complex containing bacterially expressed Vhs and a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-eIF4H fusion protein has RNase activity. eIF4H shares a region of sequence homology with eIF4B, and it appears to be functionally similar in that both stimulate the RNA helicase activity of eIF4A, a component of the mRNA cap-binding complex eIF4F. We show that eIF4H interacts physically with eIF4A in the yeast two-hybrid system and in GST pull-down assays and that the two proteins can be coimmunoprecipitated from mammalian cells. Vhs also interacts with eIF4A in GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Site-directed mutagenesis of Vhs and eIF4H revealed residues of each that are important for their mutual interaction, but not for their interaction with eIF4A. Thus, Vhs, eIF4H, and eIF4A comprise a group of proteins, each of which is able to interact directly with the other two. Whether they interact simultaneously as a tripartite complex or sequentially is unclear. The data suggest a mechanism for linking the degradation of an mRNA to its translation and for targeting Vhs to mRNAs and to regions of translation initiation."
16254338,The vaccinia virus F1L protein interacts with the proapoptotic protein Bak and inhibits Bak activation.,"Many viruses have evolved strategies to counteract cellular immune responses, including apoptosis. Vaccinia virus, a member of the poxvirus family, encodes an antiapoptotic protein, F1L. F1L localizes to mitochondria and inhibits apoptosis by preventing the release of cytochrome c by an undetermined mechanism (S. T. Wasilenko, T. L. Stewart, A. F. Meyers, and M. Barry, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:14345-14350, 2003; T. L. Stewart, S. T. Wasilenko, and M. Barry, J. Virol. 79:1084-1098, 2005). Here, we show that in the absence of an apoptotic stimulus, F1L associates with Bak, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that plays a pivotal role in the release of cytochrome c. Cells infected with vaccinia virus were resistant to Bak oligomerization and the initial N-terminal exposure of Bak following the induction of apoptosis with staurosporine. A mutant vaccinia virus missing F1L was no longer able to inhibit apoptosis or Bak activation. In addition, the expression of F1L was essential to inhibit tBid-induced cytochrome c release in both wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and Bax-deficient MEFs, indicating that F1L could inhibit apoptosis in the presence and absence of Bax. tBid-induced Bak oligomerization and N-terminal exposure of Bak in Bax-deficient MEFs were inhibited during virus infection, as assessed by cross-linking and limited trypsin proteolysis. Infection with the F1L deletion virus no longer provided protection from tBid-induced Bak activation and apoptosis. Additionally, infection of Jurkat cells with the F1L deletion virus resulted in cellular apoptosis, as measured by loss of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase 3 activation, and cytochrome c release, indicating that the presence of F1L was pivotal for inhibiting vaccinia virus-induced apoptosis. Our data indicate that F1L expression during infection inhibits apoptosis and interferes with the activation of Bak."
16580632,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein 7a interacts with hSGT.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 7a is an accessory protein with no known homologues. In this study, we report the interaction of a SARS-CoV 7a and small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein (SGT). SARS-CoV 7a and human SGT interaction was identified using a two-hybrid system screen and confirmed with interaction screens in cell culture and cellular co-localization studies. The SGT domain of interaction was mapped by deletion mutant analysis and results indicated that tetratricopeptide repeat 2 (aa 125-158) was essential for interaction. We also showed that 7a interacted with SARS-CoV structural proteins M (membrane) and E (envelope), which have been shown to be essential for virus-like particle formation. Taken together, our results coupled with data from studies of the interaction between SGT and HIV-1 vpu indicated that SGT could be involved in the life-cycle, possibly assembly of SARS-CoV."
14534539,Nuclear export of adenovirus E4orf6 protein is necessary for its ability to antagonize apoptotic activity of BH3-only proteins.,"The adenovirus E4orf6 is a viral oncoprotein known to cooperate with the E1A gene product in transforming primary murine cells. It has been shown to inhibit the apoptotic activities of p53 and p73 through direct binding to these proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the adenovirus E4orf6 protein inhibits apoptosis mediated by BNIP3 and Bik, which are BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family. This activity was not mediated by p53 and p73 because E4orf6 had the same effect on the apoptosis in Saos-2 cells that do not express p53-related genes. It was also ascertained that E4orf6 could change the mitochondrial localization of BNIP3 and Bik. A mutant lacking the nuclear export signal of E4orf6 failed to inhibit apoptosis and to translocate BNIP3 protein from the mitochondria. Moreover, it was also established that E4orf6 was able to interact with BNIP3 and Bik. In BNIP3 protein, the region required for the interaction included the transmembrane domain, which is required for the localization of BNIP3 to the mitochondria. These results suggest that E4orf6 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, enabling it to interact with BH3-only proteins, eventually leading to the inhibition of apoptotic activity."
8618882,Functional antagonism between the retinoic acid receptor and the viral transactivator BZLF1 is mediated by protein-protein interactions.,"The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded protein BZLF1 is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZip) family of transcription factors. Like several other members of the bZip family, transcriptional activity of BZLF1 is modulated by retinoic acid receptors (RARs). We present evidence that the RAR alpha and BZLF1 can reciprocally repress each other's transcriptional activation by a newly discovered mechanism. Analysis of RAR alpha mutants in transfection studies reveals that the DNA binding domain is sufficient for inhibition of BZLF1 activity. Analysis of BZLF1 mutants indicates that both the coiled-coil dimerization domain and a region containing the transcriptional activation domain of BZLF1 are required for transrepression. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate physical interactions between RAR alpha and BZLF1 in vivo. Furthermore, glutathione S-transferase-pulldown assays reveal that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by the coiled-coil dimerization domain of BZLF1 and the DNA binding domain of RAR alpha. While RAR alpha is unable to recognize BZLF1 binding sites, the RAR alpha can be tethered to the DNA by forming a heteromeric complex with BZLF1 bound to DNA. Tethering RARs via protein-protein interactions onto promoter DNA suggest a mechanism through which RARs might gain additional levels of transcriptional regulation."
15688292,Function of HAb18G/CD147 in invasion of host cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,"To identify the function of HAb18G/CD147 in invasion of host cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), we analyzed the protein-protein interaction among HAb18G/CD147, cyclophilin A (CyPA), and SARS-CoV structural proteins by coimmunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance analysis. Although none of the SARS-CoV proteins was found to be directly bound to HAb18G/CD147, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV was bound to CyPA, which interacted with HAb18G/CD147. Further research showed that HAb18G/CD147, a transmembrane molecule, was highly expressed on 293 cells and that CyPA was integrated with SARS-CoV. HAb18G/CD147-antagonistic peptide (AP)-9, an AP of HAb18G/CD147, had a high rate of binding to 293 cells and an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV. These results show that HAb18G/CD147, mediated by CyPA bound to SARS-CoV N protein, plays a functional role in facilitating invasion of host cells by SARS-CoV. Our findings provide some evidence for the cytologic mechanism of invasion by SARS-CoV and provide a molecular basis for screening anti-SARS drugs."
9973611,"FBI-1, a factor that binds to the HIV-1 inducer of short transcripts (IST), is a POZ domain protein.","The HIV-1 promoter directs the synthesis of two classes of transcripts, short, non-polyadenylated transcripts and full-length, polyadenylated transcripts. The synthesis of short transcripts is activated by a bipartite DNA element, the inducer of short transcripts or IST, located downstream of the HIV-1 transcriptional start site, while the synthesis of full-length transcripts is activated by the viral activator Tat. Tat binds to the RNA element TAR, which is encoded largely between the two IST half-elements. Upon activation by Tat, the synthesis of short RNAs is repressed. We have previously purified a factor called FBI-1 (for factor that binds to IST) whose binding to wild-type and mutated ISTs correlated well with the abilities of these ISTs to direct the synthesis of short transcripts. Here, we report the cloning of cDNAs encoding FBI-1. FBI-1 contains a POZ domain at its N-terminus and four Krüppel-type zinc fingers at its C-terminus. The C-terminus is sufficient for specific binding, and FBI-1 can form homomers through its POZ domain and, in vivo, through its zinc finger domain as well. In addition, FBI-1 associates with Tat, suggesting that repression of the short transcripts by Tat may be mediated through interactions between the two factors."
11931765,Structural basis of lysine-acetylated HIV-1 Tat recognition by PCAF bromodomain.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) trans-activator protein Tat stimulates transcription of the integrated HIV-1 genome and promotes viral replication in infected cells. Tat transactivation activity is dependent on lysine acetylation and its association with nuclear histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP (CREB binding protein) and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). Here, we show that the bromodomain of PCAF binds specifically to HIV-1 Tat acetylated at lysine 50 and that this interaction competes effectively against HIV-1 TAR RNA binding to the lysine-acetylated Tat. The three-dimensional solution structure of the PCAF bromodomain in complex with a lysine 50-acetylated Tat peptide together with biochemical analyses provides the structural basis for the specificity of this molecular recognition and reveals insights into the differences in ligand selectivity of bromodomains."
16139856,Interaction of HIV-1 Gag with the clathrin-associated adaptor AP-2.,"The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV-1 interacts with the clathrin-associated adaptor complex AP-2 during the late phase of the viral replication cycle. Upon its synthesis, Env, therefore, is retrieved from the cellular surface unless internalization is inhibited by viral Gag. Here we demonstrate that not only Env, but also HIV-1 Gag, specifically binds to AP-2. Gag-AP-2 association was found to depend on tyrosine residue 132 and valine residue 135 at the matrix-capsid junction in the Gag polyprotein. Results of a morphological analysis of viral egress from cells expressing dominant-negative AP-2 suggest an involvement of AP-2 in confining HIV-1 exit to distinct microdomains. Further, particle release from AP-2-mutant cells was enhanced compared to release from wild-type cells but the infectivity of virus released from these cells was moderately reduced. Together these data attribute a role to the AP-2 complex in the regulation of HIV-1 assembly/release."
16460827,Sumoylation of Rta of Epstein-Barr virus is preferentially enhanced by PIASxbeta.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses an immediate-early protein, Rta, to activate the viral lytic cycle. This study identifies PIASxalpha and PIASxbeta as binding partners of Rta in a yeast two-hybrid screen and demonstrates the binding of Rta to PIASxalpha and PIASxbeta in vitro by GST pull-down analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and indirect immunofluorescence analysis show that Rta interacts and colocalizes with PIASxalpha and PIASxbeta in the nucleus. These interactions seem to enhance Rta sumoylation as transfecting plasmids expressing PIASxalpha, PIASxbeta, Ubc9, or SUMO-1 increase the capacity of Rta to transactivate a promoter that contains an Rta-response element and the promoters of p21 and BNLF1 in transient transfection assay. This study also finds that Rta sumoylation is preferentially enhanced by PIASxbeta, which could be attributed to the fact that PIASxbeta, compared to PIASxalpha, has a strong affinity to Rta, suggesting that affinity of a SUMO E3 ligase to its target protein influences the function of protein sumoylation."
1667585,Interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type I Rev protein with nuclear scaffold nucleoside triphosphatase activity.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type I encodes a regulatory protein, termed Rev, which is associated with the appearance of unspliced and partially spliced viral RNAs in the cytoplasm. Rev is believed to function via interaction with a sequence element in the env region of the viral RNA, termed the Rev-responsive element (RRE). In this study, we use a stably transfected, Rev-producing mouse cell line to show that low, functional levels of Rev are associated with the nuclear scaffold (NS). Immunohistochemical studies localize Rev to the NS. Furthermore, immunoblot analyses demonstrate the presence of Rev in NS preparations isolated from Rev-producing cells and document binding of purified Rev protein to isolated NS or to cloned lamin C in vitro. Results with an in vitro RNA transport assay suggest that Rev is associated with a significant defect in transport of RNAs which lack RRE, whereas transport of RRE-containing transcripts proceeds efficiently. This Rev-induced transport defect appears to be mediated via direct inhibition of NS nucleoside triphosphatase, an enzyme thought to be involved in the nucleocytoplasmic transport process. NS preparations isolated from Rev-producing cells show a significantly lower nucleoside triphosphatase activity than those from control preparations. Addition of Rev protein to isolated NS produces a significant inhibition of NS nucleoside triphosphatase activity, which is specifically reversed by addition of RRE transcripts. These data suggest that a major aspect of Rev function may involve selective modulation of host cell nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanisms via interaction with the NS."
7509037,Transformation by polyoma virus middle T-antigen involves the binding and tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc.,"Polyoma virus middle T-antigen converts normal fibroblasts to a fully transformed, tumorigenic phenotype. It achieves this, at least in part, by binding and activating one of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases, pp60c-src, pp62c-yes or pp59c-fyn (reviewed in refs 2 and 3). As a result, middle T-antigen itself is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, one of which (Tyr 315) acts as a binding site for the SH2 domains of phosphatidylinositol-3'OH kinase 85K subunit. Here we show that another tyrosine phosphorylation site in middle T-antigen (Tyr 250; refs 4, 5) acts as a binding region for the SH2 domain of the transforming protein Shc. This results in Shc also becoming tyrosine-phosphorylated and binding to the SH2 domain of Grb2 (ref. 10). This probably stimulates p21ras activity through the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor Sos (reviewed in ref. 11). We suggest that middle T-antigen transforms cells by acting as a functional homologue of an activated tyrosine kinase-associated growth-factor receptor."
15004026,An anti-apoptotic viral protein that recruits Bax to mitochondria.,"The viral mitochondria-localized inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA), encoded by the UL37 gene of human cytomegalovirus, inhibits apoptosis-associated mitochondrial membrane permeabilization by a mechanism different from that of Bcl-2. Here we show that vMIA induces several changes in Bax that resemble those found in apoptotic cells yet take place in unstimulated, non-apoptotic vMIA-expressing cells. These changes include the constitutive localization of Bax at mitochondria, where it associates tightly with the mitochondrial membrane, forming high molecular weight aggregates that contain vMIA. vMIA recruits Bax to mitochondria but delays relocation of caspase-8-activated truncated Bid-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (t-Bid-GFP) to mitochondria. The ability of vMIA and its deletion mutants to associate with Bax and to induce relocation of Bax to mitochondria correlates with their anti-apoptotic activity and with their ability to suppress mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Taken together, our data indicate that vMIA blocks apoptosis via its interaction with Bax. vMIA neutralizes Bax by recruiting it to mitochondria and ""freezing"" its pro-apoptotic activity. These data unravel a novel strategy of subverting an intrinsic pathway of apoptotic signaling."
10207088,Reciprocal modulatory interaction between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat and transcription factor NFAT1.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression is regulated by interactions between both viral and host factors. These interactions are also responsible for changes in the expression of many host cell genes, including cytokines and other immune regulators, which may account for the state of immunological dysregulation that characterizes HIV-1 infection. We have investigated the role of a host cell protein, the transcription factor NFAT1, in HIV-1 pathogenesis. We show that NFAT1 interacts with Tat and that this interaction, which involves the major transactivation domain of NFAT1 and the amino-terminal region of Tat, results in a reciprocal modulatory interplay between the proteins: whereas Tat enhances NFAT1-driven transcription in Jurkat T cells, NFAT1 represses Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Moreover, NFAT1 binds to the kappaB sites on the viral LTR and negatively regulates NF-kappaB-mediated activation of HIV-1 transcription, by competing with NF-kappaB1 for its binding sites on the HIV-1 LTR. Tat-mediated enhancement of NFAT1 transactivation may explain the upregulation of interleukin 2 and other cytokines that occurs during HIV-1 infection. We discuss the potentially opposing roles of NFAT1 and another family member, NFAT2, in regulating gene transcription of HIV-1 and endogenous cytokine genes."
10446967,Interaction of adeno-associated virus Rep78 with p53: implications in growth inhibition.,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a nonpathogenic, single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the parvoviridae family. Onco-suppressive properties of AAV against adenovirus, a DNA tumor virus, have been well documented. Rep78, a major regulatory protein of AAV, is believed to be responsible for its antioncogenic properties. Most DNA tumor viruses disturb the cell cycle pathways by essentially abrogating the functions of p53. Here we present evidence that AAV acts as an antiproliferative agent against adenovirus by protecting the adenoviral-mediated degradation of p53 as confirmed by both Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-p53 antibody. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the AAV Rep78 is physically bound to p53 in vivo. Furthermore, the binding of purified p53 to the AAV Rep78 affinity column confirms their interaction. These results document for the first time that the antiproliferative effects of AAV against adenovirus are mediated, at least in part, by the interaction of AAV Rep78 with p53."
7724608,The glucocorticoid receptor type II complex is a target of the HIV-1 vpr gene product.,"The vpr gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a 15-kDa virion-associated protein that functions as a regulator of cellular processes linked to the HIV life cycle. We report the interaction of a 41-kDa cytosolic viral protein R interacting protein 1 (Rip-1) with Vpr in vitro. Rip-1 displays a wide tissue distribution, including relevant targets of HIV infection. Vpr protein induced nuclear translocation of Rip-1, as did glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-II-stimulating steroids. Importantly, Vpr and Rip-1 coimmunoprecipitated with the human GR as part of an activated receptor complex. Vpr complementation of a vpr mutant virus was also mimicked by GR-II-stimulating steroids. Vpr and GR-II actions were inhibited by mifepristone, a GR-II pathway inhibitor. Together these data directly link the activity of the vpr gene product to the glucocorticoid steroid pathway and provide a biochemical mechanism for the cellular and viral activity of Vpr, as well as suggest that a unique class of antivirals, which includes mifepristone (RU486), may influence HIV-1 replication."
15653685,HIV-1 Nef disrupts antigen presentation early in the secretory pathway.,"Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 Nef disrupts viral antigen presentation and promotes viral immune evasion from cytotoxic T lymphocytes. There is evidence that Nef acts early in the secretory pathway to redirect major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) from the trans-Golgi network to the endolysosomal pathway. However, a competing model suggests that Nef acts much later by accelerating MHC-I turnover at the cell surface. Here we demonstrate that Nef targets early forms of MHC-I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum by preferentially binding hypophosphorylated cytoplasmic tails. The Nef-MHC-I complex migrates normally into the Golgi apparatus but subsequently fails to arrive at the cell surface and become phosphorylated. Cell type-specific differences in the rate of MHC-I transport through the secretory pathway correlate with responsiveness to Nef and co-precipitation of adaptor protein 1 with the Nef.MHC-I complex. We propose that the assembly of a Nef.MHC-I.adaptor protein 1 complex early in the secretory pathway is important for Nef activity."
15033456,Characterization of a region involved in binding of measles virus H protein and its receptor SLAM (CD150).,"Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM; also known as CD150) is a newly identified cellular receptor for measles virus (MV). MV Hemagglutinin protein (H) mediates MV entry into host cells by specifically binding to SLAM. Amino acid 27-135 of SLAM was previously shown to be the functional domain to interact with H and used to screen a 10-mer phage display peptide library in this study. After four rounds of screening and sequence analysis, the deduced amino acid sequence of screened peptides SGFDPLITHA and SDWDPLFTHK showed to be highly homologous with amino acid 429-438 of MV H (SGFGPLITHG). Peptides SGFDPLITHA and SDWDPLFTHK specifically inhibited binding of H to SLAM and further inhibition of MV infection suggests that these peptides can be developed to MV blocking reagents and amino acid 429-438 in H protein is functionally involved in receptor binding and may constitute part of the receptor-binding determinants on H protein."
15135058,Furin cleavage of the HIV-1 Tat protein.,"Extracellular human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat protein and Tat-derived peptides are biologically active but mechanisms of Tat processing are not known. Within the highly conserved basic region of HIV-1 Tat protein (amino acids, a.a. 48-56), we identified two putative furin cleavage sites and showed that Tat protein was cleaved in vitro at the second site, RQRR\ (a.a. 53-56\). This in vitro cleavage was blocked by a monoclonal antibody that binds near the cleavage site or by the furin inhibitor alpha-1 PDX. Monocytoid cells rich in furin also degraded Tat and this process was slowed by the furin inhibitor or the specific monoclonal antibody. Furin processing did not affect the rates for Tat uptake and nuclear accumulation in HeLa or Jurkat cells, but the transactivation activity was greatly reduced. Furin processing is a likely mechanism for inactivating extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein."
15163754,Late assembly motifs of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 and their relative roles in particle release.,"Three late assembly domain consensus motifs, namely PTAP, PPPY, and LYPXL, have been identified in different retroviruses. They have been shown to interact with the cellular proteins TSG101, Nedd4, and AP2 or AIP, respectively. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has a PPPY and a PTAP motif, separated by two amino acids, located at the end of MA, but only the PPPY motif is conserved in the deltaretrovirus group. Like other retroviral peptides carrying the late motif, MA is mono- or di-ubiquitinated. A mutational analysis showed that 90% of PPPY mutant particles were retained in the cell compared to 15% for the wild-type virus. Mutations of the PTAP motif resulted in a 20% decrease in particle release. In single-cycle infectivity assays, the infectious titers of late motif mutants correlated with the amounts of released virus, as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We observed binding of MA to the WW domains of the Nedd4 family member WWP1 but not to the amino-terminal ubiquitin E2 variant domain of TSG101 in mammalian two-hybrid analyses. The binding to WWP1 was eliminated when the PPPY motif was mutated. However, MA showed binding to TSG101 in the yeast two-hybrid system that was dependent on an intact PTAP motif. A dominant-negative (DN) mutant of WWP1 could inhibit budding of the intact HTLV-1 virus. In contrast, DN TSG101 only affected the release of virus-like particles encoded by Gag expression plasmids. Electron and fluorescent microscopy showed that Gag accumulates in large patches in the membranes of cells expressing viruses with PPPY mutations. Very few tethered immature particles could be detected in these samples, suggesting that budding is impaired at an earlier step than in other retroviruses."
9060613,The murine AIDS virus Gag precursor protein binds to the SH3 domain of c-Abl.,"The Pr60gag protein of the murine AIDS (MAIDS) defective virus promotes the proliferation of the infected target B cells and is responsible for inducing a severe immunodeficiency disease. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the SH3 domain of c-Abl as interacting with the proline-rich p12 domain of Pr60gag. The two proteins were shown to associate in vitro and in vivo in MAIDS virus-infected B cells. Overexpression of Pr60(gag) in these cells led to a detectable increase of the levels of c-Abl protein and to its translocation at the membrane. These results suggest that this viral protein serves as a docking site for signaling molecules and that c-Abl may be involved in the proliferation of infected B cells."
14966139,A single amino acid determinant governs the species-specific sensitivity of APOBEC3G to Vif action.,"APOBEC3G (also known as CEM15) is an innate intracellular antiretroviral factor that is counteracted by the Vif protein of lentiviruses. While APOBEC3G orthologues from several species are active against a broad range of retroviruses, given Vif proteins have a narrow spectrum of activity. For instance, HIV-1 Vif efficiently blocks APOBEC3G from human but not African green monkey (AGM), whereas the reverse is observed with SIV(AGM) Vif. Here, we demonstrate that a single amino acid at position 128 of human and AGM APOBEC3G governs the virus-specific sensitivity of these proteins to Vif-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, we show that this phenotype correlates with the ability of Vif to bind APOBEC3G and interfere with its incorporation into virions. These results shed light on an important determinant of the tropism of primate lentiviruses."
8676484,The human immunodeficiency virus Tat proteins specifically associate with TAK in vivo and require the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II for function.,"Human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 encode closely related proteins, Tat-1 and Tat-2, that stimulate viral transcription. Previously, we showed that the activation domains of these proteins specifically interact in vitro with a cellular protein kinase named TAK. In vitro, TAK phosphorylates the Tat-2 but not the Tat-1 protein, a 42-kDa polypeptide of unknown identity, and the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). We now show that the 42-kDa substrate of TAK cochromatographs with TAK activity, suggesting that this 42-kDa polypeptide is a subunit of TAK. We also show that the Tat proteins specifically associate with TAK in vivo, since wild-type Tat-1 and Tat-2 proteins expressed in mammalian cells, but not mutant Tat proteins containing a nonfunctional activation domain, can be coimmunoprecipitated with TAK. We also mapped the in vivo phosphorylation sites of Tat-2 to the carboxyl terminus of the protein, but analysis of proteins with mutations at these sites suggests that phosphorylation is not essential for Tat-2 transactivation function. We further investigated whether the CTD of RNAP II is required for Tat function in vivo. Using plasmid constructs that express an alpha-amanitin-resistant RNAP II subunit with a truncated or full-length CTD, we found that an intact CTD is required for Tat function. These observations strengthen the proposal that the mechanism of action of Tat involves the recruitment or activation of TAK, resulting in activated transcription through phosphorylation of the CTD."
10393969,A single amino acid substitution in the cyclin D binding domain of the infected cell protein no. 0 abrogates the neuroinvasiveness of herpes simplex virus without affecting its ability to replicate.,"The infected cell protein no. 0 (ICP0) of herpes simplex virus 1 is a promiscuous transactivator shown to enhance the expression of genes introduced into cells by infection or transfection. The protein interacts with several viral and cellular proteins. Earlier studies have shown that ICP0 binds and stabilizes cyclin D3 but does interfere with the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, its major function. Cyclin D3 plays a key role in the transition from G1 to S phase. To define the role of cyclin D3 in productive infection, the ICP0 binding site for cyclin D3 was mapped and mutagenized by substitution of aspartic acid codon 199 with the alanine codon. We report that the substitution precluded the interaction of this protein with cyclin D3 in the yeast two-hybrid system and the stabilization of cyclin D3 in infected cells. A recombinant virus carrying this mutation could not be differentiated from wild-type parent with respect to replication in dividing cells but yielded 10-fold less progeny from infected resting cells and serum-deprived or contact-inhibited human fibroblasts. In mice, the mutant was only slightly less pathogenic than the wild-type parent by intracerebral route but was significantly less neuroinvasive after peripheral inoculation. Replacement of the mutated amino acid with aspartic acid restored wild-type phenotype. Stabilization of cyclin D3 therefore is linked to higher virus yields in nondividing cells and potentially higher virulence in experimental and natural hosts. One function of ICP0 is to scavenge the cell for proteins that could bolster viral replication."
7939687,Folding of VSV G protein: sequential interaction with BiP and calnexin.,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains molecular chaperones that facilitate the folding of proteins in mammalian cells. Biosynthetic labeling was used to study the interactions of two chaperones, BiP and calnexin, with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G protein). Coimmunoprecipitation of G protein with the chaperones showed that BiP bound maximally to early folding intermediates of G protein, whereas calnexin bound after a short lag to more folded molecules. Castanospermine, an inhibitor of ER glucosidases, blocked the binding of proteins to calnexin and inhibited G protein folding. Interaction with calnexin was necessary for efficient folding of G protein and for retention of partially folded forms."
19494010,Nuclear factor 90 negatively regulates influenza virus replication by interacting with viral nucleoprotein.,"Interactions between host factors and the viral replication complex play important roles in host adaptation and regulation of influenza virus replication. A cellular protein, nuclear factor 90 (NF90), was copurified with H5N1 viral nucleoprotein (NP) from human cells in which NP was transiently expressed and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis. In vitro coimmunoprecipitation of NF90 and NP coexpressed in HEK 293T cells or individually expressed in bacterial and HEK 293T cells, respectively, confirmed a direct interaction between NF90 and NP, independent of other subunits of the ribonucleoprotein complex. This interaction was prevented by a mutation, F412A, in the C-terminal region of the NP, indicating that the C-terminal of NP is required for NF90 binding. RNase V treatment did not prevent coprecipitation of NP and NF90, which demonstrates that the interaction is RNA binding independent. After small interfering RNA knockdown of NF90 expression in A549 and HeLa cells, viral polymerase complex activity and virus replication were significantly increased, suggesting that NF90 negatively affects viral replication. Both NP and NF90 colocalized in the nucleus of virus-infected cells during the early phase of infection, suggesting that the interaction between NF90 and NP is an early event in virus replication. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that NF90 downregulates both viral genome replication and mRNA transcription in infected cells. These results suggest that NF90 inhibits influenza virus replication during the early phase of infection through direct interaction with viral NP."
17522211,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vif inhibits packaging and antiviral activity of a degradation-resistant APOBEC3G variant.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif counteracts the antiviral activity of the human cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (APO3G) by inhibiting its incorporation into virions. This has been attributed to the Vif-induced degradation of APO3G by cytoplasmic proteasomes. We recently demonstrated that although APO3G has a natural tendency to form RNA-dependent homo-multimers, multimerization was not essential for encapsidation into HIV-1 virions or antiviral activity. We now demonstrate that a multimerization-defective APO3G variant (APO3G C97A) is able to assemble into RNase-sensitive high-molecular-mass (HMM) complexes, suggesting that homo-multimerization of APO3G and assembly into HMM complexes are unrelated RNA-dependent processes. Interestingly, APO3G C97A was highly resistant to Vif-induced degradation even though the two proteins were found to interact in coimmunoprecipitation experiments and exhibited partial colocalization in transfected HeLa cells. Surprisingly, encapsidation and antiviral activity of APO3G C97A were both inhibited by Vif despite resistance to degradation. These results demonstrate that targeting of APO3G to proteasome degradation and interference with viral encapsidation are distinct functional properties of Vif."
17705188,The membrane protein of SARS-CoV suppresses NF-kappaB activation.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infects many organs, such as lung, liver, and immune organs and causes life-threatening atypical pneumonia, SARS causes high morbidity and mortality rates. The molecular mechanism of SARS pathogenesis remains elusive. Inflammatory stimuli can activate IkappaB kinase (IKK) signalsome and subsequently the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), which influences gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) along with other transcription factors. In this work, we found that the membrane (M) protein of SARS-CoV physically interacted with IKKbeta using a co-immunoprecipitation assay (IPA). Expression of M suppressed tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) induced NF-kappaB activation using a luciferase reporter assay. Further investigation showed M protein suppressed Cox-2 expression using a luciferase reporter gene assay, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The carboxyl terminal of M protein was sufficient for the M protein function. Together, these results indicate that SARS-CoV M suppresses NF-kappaB activity probably through a direct interaction with IKKbeta, resulting in lower Cox-2 expression. Suppression of NF-kappaB activity and Cox-2 expression may contribute to SARS pathogenesis."
16431925,Syk tyrosine kinase mediates Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 2A-induced cell migration in epithelial cells.,"Although spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is known to be important in hematopoietic cell development, the roles of Syk in epithelial cells have not been well studied. Limited data suggest that Syk plays alternate roles in carcinogenesis under different circumstances. In breast cancer, Syk has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor. In contrast, Syk is essential for murine mammary tumor virus-mediated transformation. However, the roles of Syk in tumor migration are still largely unknown. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, an unusually highly metastatic tumor, expresses Epstein-Barr virus LMP2A (latent membrane protein 2A) in most clinical specimens. Previously, we demonstrated LMP2A triggers epithelial cell migration. LMP2A contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, which is important for Syk kinase activation in B cells. In this study, we explored whether Syk is important for LMP2A-mediated epithelial cell migration. We demonstrate that LMP2A expression can activate endogenous Syk activity. The activation requires the tyrosine residues in LMP2A ITAM but not YEEA motif, which is important for Syk activation by Lyn in B cells. LMP2A interacts with Syk as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. Furthermore, LMP2A-induced cell migration is inhibited by a Syk inhibitor and short interfering RNA. Tyrosines 74 and 85 in the LMP2A immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif are essential for both Syk activation and LMP2A-mediated cell migration, indicating the involvement of Syk in LMP2A-triggered cell migration. The LMP2A-Syk pathway may provide suitable drug targets for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma."
12692226,"Members of the AP-1 family, c-Jun and c-Fos, functionally interact with JC virus early regulatory protein large T antigen.","The activating protein 1 (AP-1) family of regulatory proteins is characterized as immediate-early inducible transcription factors which were shown to be activated by a variety of stress-related stimuli and to be involved in numerous biological processes, including cellular and viral gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. We have recently demonstrated the involvement of the AP-1 family members c-Jun and c-Fos in transcriptional regulation of the human polyomavirus, JC virus (JCV), genome. Here, we further examined their role in JCV gene regulation and replication through their physical and functional interaction with JCV early regulatory protein large T antigen (T-Ag). Transfection and replication studies indicated that c-Jun and c-Fos can significantly diminish T-Ag-mediated JCV gene transcription and replication. Affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that c-Jun and T-Ag physically interact with each other. Results from band shift assays showed that the binding efficiency of c-Jun to the AP-1 site was reduced in the presence of T-Ag. In addition, we have mapped, through the use of a series of deletion mutants, the regions of these proteins which are important for their interaction. While the c-Jun interaction domain of T-Ag is localized to the middle portion of the protein, the T-Ag interacting domain of c-Jun maps to its basic-DNA binding region. Results of transient-transfection assays with various c-Jun mutants and T-Ag expression constructs further confirm the specificity of the functional interaction between c-Jun and T-Ag. Taken together, these data demonstrate that immediate-early inducible transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos physically and functionally interact with JCV major early regulatory protein large T-Ag and that this interaction modulates JCV transcription and replication in glial cells."
16048439,Bcl-xL inhibits T-cell apoptosis induced by expression of SARS coronavirus E protein in the absence of growth factors.,"One of the hallmark findings in patients suffering from SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is lymphopenia, which is the result of massive lymphocyte death. SARS-CoV (SARS coronavirus), a novel coronavirus that has been etiologically associated with SARS cases, is homologous with MHV (murine hepatitis coronavirus), and MHV small envelope E protein is capable of inducing apoptosis. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV encodes a small envelope E protein that is homologous with MHV E protein, thus inducing T-cell apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, a cDNA encoding SARS-CoV E protein was created using whole gene synthesis. Our results showed that SARS-CoV E protein induced apoptosis in the transfected Jurkat T-cells, which was amplified to higher apoptosis rates in the absence of growth factors. However, apoptosis was inhibited by overexpressed antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV E protein interacted with Bcl-xL in vitro and endogenous Bcl-xL in vivo and that Bcl-xL interaction with SARS-CoV E protein was mediated by BH3 (Bcl-2 homology domain 3) of Bcl-xL. Finally, we identified a novel BH3-like region located in the C-terminal cytosolic domain of SARS-CoV E protein, which mediates its binding to Bcl-xL. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a novel molecular mechanism of T-cell apoptosis that contributes to the SARS-CoV-induced lymphopenia observed in most SARS patients."
9060615,Specific repression of Tax trans-activation by TAR RNA-binding protein TRBP.,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-encoded Tax protein activates transcription from the long terminal repetition via association with host cellular factors. In this study, we searched for cellular proteins that interact with Tax and modulate its activity by using the yeast two-hybrid system. One of the strongest interactors was found to be identical with TRBP, which was previously shown to bind to the RNA encoded by the Tat response element of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Interactions are demonstrated with Escherichia coli-expressed proteins in vitro and in mammalian cells, using one- and two-hybrid systems, and with antibodies that coprecipitate Tax and TRBP at physiological TRBP concentrations. Moreover, TRBP, when directed into the cytoplasm, is capable of preventing transport of Tax into the nucleus. A 60-amino-acid polypeptide suffices for binding to Tax. TRBP inhibits activation of transcription by both Tax and GAL4-Tax fusion proteins. Inhibition is specific for Tax and is not seen with the other activators tested. Our data are consistent with the interpretation that TRBP inhibits the interplay of Tax with the transcription machinery or accessory factors."
10022908,A human sequence homologue of Staufen is an RNA-binding protein that is associated with polysomes and localizes to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.,"In the course of a two-hybrid screen with the NS1 protein of influenza virus, a human clone capable of coding for a protein with high homology to the Staufen protein from Drosophila melanogaster (dmStaufen) was identified. With these sequences used as a probe, cDNAs were isolated from a lambda cDNA library. The encoded protein (hStaufen-like) contained four double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding domains with 55% similarity and 38% identity to those of dmStaufen, including identity at all residues involved in RNA binding. A recombinant protein containing all dsRNA-binding domains was expressed in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged polypeptide. It showed dsRNA binding activity in vitro, with an apparent Kd of 10(-9) M. Using a specific antibody, we detected in human cells a major form of the hStaufen-like protein with an apparent molecular mass of 60 to 65 kDa. The intracellular localization of hStaufen-like protein was investigated by immunofluorescence using a series of markers for the cell compartments. Colocalization was observed with the rough endoplasmic reticulum but not with endosomes, cytoskeleton, or Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, sedimentation analyses indicated that hStaufen-like protein associates with polysomes. These results are discussed in relation to the possible functions of the protein."
11069998,The carboxy-terminal fragment of nucleolin interacts with the nucleocapsid domain of retroviral gag proteins and inhibits virion assembly.,"A yeast two-hybrid screen for cellular proteins that interact with the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) Gag protein resulted in the identification of nucleolin, a host protein known to function in ribosome assembly. The interacting fusions contained the carboxy-terminal 212 amino acids of nucleolin [Nuc(212)]. The nucleocapsid (NC) portion of Gag was necessary and sufficient to mediate the binding to Nuc(212). The interaction of Gag with Nuc(212) could be demonstrated in vitro and was manifested in vivo by the NC-dependent incorporation of Nuc(212) inside MuLV virions. Overexpression of Nuc(212), but not full-length nucleolin, potently and specifically blocked MuLV virion assembly and/or release. A mutant of MuLV, selected to specifically disrupt the binding to Nuc(212), was found to be severely defective for virion assembly. This mutant harbors a single point mutation in capsid (CA) adjacent to the CA-NC junction, suggesting a role for this region in Moloney MuLV assembly. These experiments demonstrate that selection for proteins that bind assembly domain(s) can yield potent inhibitors of virion assembly. These experiments also raise the possibility that a nucleolin-Gag interaction may be involved in virion assembly."
15096517,Vpr-mediated incorporation of UNG2 into HIV-1 particles is required to modulate the virus mutation rate and for replication in macrophages.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is able to infect nondividing cells, such as macrophages, and the viral Vpr protein has been shown to participate in this process. Here, we investigated the impact of the recruitment into virus particles of the nuclear form of uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2), a cellular DNA repair enzyme, on the virus mutation rate and on replication in macrophages. We demonstrate that the interaction of Vpr with UNG2 led to virion incorporation of a catalytically active enzyme that is directly involved with Vpr in modulating the virus mutation rate. The lack of UNG in virions during virus replication in primary monocyte-derived macrophages further exacerbated virus mutant frequencies to an 18-fold increase compared with the 4-fold increase measured in actively dividing cells. Because the presence of UNG is also critical for efficient infection of macrophages, these observations extend the role of Vpr to another early step of the virus life cycle, e.g. viral DNA synthesis, that is essential for replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in nondividing cells."
10683337,Cellular expression of alphaherpesvirus gD interferes with entry of homologous and heterologous alphaherpesviruses by blocking access to a shared gD receptor.,"Several human and animal alphaherpesviruses can enter cells via human herpesvirus entry mediator C (HveC), a receptor for viral glycoprotein D (gD). In previous studies with cells expressing unknown entry mediators, cellular expression of alphaherpesvirus gD was shown to inhibit entry of the homologous virus and sometimes also of heterologous alphaherpesviruses. To investigate the mechanism of gD-mediated interference and the basis for cross-interference among alphaherpesviruses, HveC was expressed in cells as the sole entry mediator, in the presence or absence of one of the gDs encoded by herpes simplex virus type 1, pseudorabies virus, or bovine herpesvirus type 1. Cells expressing HveC alone were highly susceptible to entry of all three viruses, whereas cells coexpressing HveC and any one of the gDs were at least partially resistant to infection by each virus. Coexpression of gD with HveC did not cause reduced levels of cell-surface HveC but the HveC had reduced ability to bind to exogenous gD. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that HveC was complexed with gD in lysates of cells expressing both. Thus, cellular expression of gD can interfere with alphaherpesvirus entry by blocking ligand-binding sites of the gD receptor(s) used for entry and cross-interference can occur because different forms of alphaherpesvirus gD can compete for shared entry receptors."
10101251,"Human hepatitis B virus X protein is detectable in nuclei of transfected cells, and is active for transactivation.","Subcellular localization and transactivation of human hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), a plausible causative factor for hepatocellular carcinogenesis, were studied in transiently transfected cells. The transactivation was detected not only by the cis-element driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay but also by immunostaining of CAT protein cotransfected into human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Scanning fluorescence microscopy showed the majority of immunological signals of HBx to be at the perinuclear region of transfected cytoplasm. HBx was also clearly detectable in the nucleus, though less intensely expressed. This was confirmed by Western analysis and coimmunoprecipitation of HBx with transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in subcellular fractionations. The percentage of HBx-positive cells coincided with that of CAT-positive cells, and confocal laser microscopy revealed the coexistence of CAT signals in GFP-HBx positive cells. The SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal (NLS) appended HBx, regardless of whether NLS was added to the N- or C-terminus, transactivated all the examined X-responsive elements (XRE) similarly as did wild-type HBx. Similar results were obtained in p53 negative Saos-2 cells. The detected nuclear HBx may be involved in modulating the transcription at the promoter level whereas the HBx in cytoplasm may be working through signal transduction pathways."
16778376,Colocalization of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) with latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus.,"Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is one of the transcriptional factors for the activation of type I Interferon (IFN) genes. It is known that IRF7 and the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are highly expressed in EBV type III latency cells, and LMP1 induces mRNA expression of IRF7. In this study, the expression pattern of endogenous IRF7 was observed in several B cell lines with or without EBV infection by immunofluorescence staining. IRF7 was localized in the cytoplasm of EBV-negative B cells and EBV type I latency B cell lines. However, IRF7 was located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of EBV type III latency cell lines. In the Jijoye cell (type III latency cell), IRF7 was colocalized with LMP1 in the cytoplasm in a capping configuration, and their interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of LMP1 and IRF7. This colocalization was confirmed by co-transfection of IRF7 and LMP1 plasmids in EBV-negative B cells. These results suggest that the IRF7 and LMP1 interact with each other, and this may relate to the mechanism whereby LMP1 exerts functional effects in B-lymphocytes."
10931842,Cooperative interaction between HIV-1 regulatory proteins Tat and Vpr modulates transcription of the viral genome.,"The virion-associated protein of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), Vpr, is a small protein with 96 amino acid residues that has the ability to modulate transcription of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter activity and affects several cellular functions. In this study we have employed molecular approaches to further investigate the mechanism by which Vpr exerts its regulatory effect upon the LTR. We show that by structural and functional interaction with Tat, a potent viral regulatory protein, Vpr synergistically enhances the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR. Because Tat utilizes cyclin T1 and its partner, CDK9 to elevate the level of transcription from the LTR, we examined the cooperativity between Vpr, Tat, and cyclin T1/CDK9 on viral gene transcription. Results from co-transfection studies indicated superactivation of LTR by Tat and cyclin T1/CDK9 in the presence of wild type Vpr. This activation was not observed with the R73S mutant of Vpr, which contains arginine to serine transition at residue 73. Interestingly, expression of R73S mutant in cells exerts a negative effect on the observed superactivation of the LTR by Tat, cyclin T1/CDK9, and wild type Vpr. Results from protein-protein interaction studies indicated that Vpr is associated with both Tat and cyclin T1 in cells expressing these proteins. Use of deletion mutant proteins in binding studies revealed that the binding sites for Tat and Vpr within cyclin T1 are distinct and that association of these two viral proteins with cyclin T1 is independent from each other. These observations suggest a working model on the cooperative interaction of Vpr with viral and cellular proteins and its involvement in control of viral gene transcription and replication. Moreover identification of R73S mutant of Vpr provides a new therapeutic avenue for controlling HIV-1 gene transcription and replication in the infected cells."
14527406,HIV-1 Vif blocks the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G by impairing both its translation and intracellular stability.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) relies on Vif (viral infectivity factor) to overcome the potent antiviral function of APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G, also known as CEM15). Using an APOBEC3G-specific antiserum, we now show that Vif prevents virion incorporation of endogenous APOBEC3G by effectively depleting the intracellular levels of this enzyme in HIV-1-infected T cells. Vif achieves this depletion by both impairing the translation of APOBEC3G mRNA and accelerating the posttranslational degradation of the APOBEC3G protein by the 26S proteasome. Vif physically interacts with APOBEC3G, and expression of Vif alone in the absence of other HIV-1 proteins is sufficient to cause depletion of APOBEC3G. These findings highlight how the bimodal translational and posttranslational inhibitory effects of Vif on APOBEC3G combine to markedly suppress the expression of this potent antiviral enzyme in virally infected cells, thereby effectively curtailing the incorporation of APOBEC3G into newly formed HIV-1 virions."
7745710,Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C is a transcriptional regulator.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA-3C) is one of five viral nuclear proteins that are essential for EBV-induced immortalization of primary human B lymphocytes in vitro. Previous studies have implied that EBNA-3C acts as a transcription factor. Using transient transfection assays, we demonstrate that EBNA-3C has two effects on reporter genes that are linked to the latent membrane protein 1 promoter, (i) low-level activation by EBNA-3C alone, as well as potentiation of EBNA-2-mediated transactivation, and (ii) inhibition of the normally strong activation mediated by EBNA-2. These two disparate effects seem to be mediated at different stages following cell feeding. The inhibitory effect of EBNA-3C was localized to a known EBNA-2 response element that had previously been shown to be recognized by the DNA-binding protein RBP-J kappa. In addition, direct interaction between RBP-J kappa and EBNA-3C was observed by coimmunoprecipitation. Activation by EBNA-3C, however, seems to be achieved via sequences that are distinct from RBP-J kappa sites, since activation remained even after these sites had been mutated. Consistent with its ability to activate transcription, a region of EBNA-3C which has homology to the glutamine-rich activation domain of Sp1 can function as a transcription activation domain when it is fused to the heterologous DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and can partially restore the activity of a mutant EBNA-2 protein with a deletion in the transactivation domain. Collectively, these data strongly support the role of EBNA-3C as a transcriptional regulator."
14578865,Hepatitis B virus X protein regulates transactivation activity and protein stability of the cancer-amplified transcription coactivator ASC-2.,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a significant role in the regulation of genes involved in inflammation and cell survival. A recently identified cellular coactivator, activating signal cointegrator 2 (ASC-2), is enriched in liver cancer cells and associates with many transcription factors that are active in hepatocytes. The tissue colocalization of these 2 proteins, in view of their similar regulatory functions, led us to examine whether HBx and ASC-2 cooperate in transcriptional activation of gene expression. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays and mammalian 2-hybrid analysis show that the transactivation domain of HBx interacts with the C-terminal domain of ASC-2. In fact, these 2 proteins associated in a ternary complex that included the transcriptional activator retinoid X receptor (RXR). Mechanistically, on expression of HBx, the half-life of the ASC-2 coactivator is observed to increase in concordance with the observed increase in ASC-2-dependent coactivation of transcription. In conclusion, these results show that HBx stabilizes the cellular coactivator ASC-2 through direct protein-protein interaction, affecting the regulation of genes actively transcribed in liver cancer cells."
9032315,The NPI-1/NPI-3 (karyopherin alpha) binding site on the influenza a virus nucleoprotein NP is a nonconventional nuclear localization signal.,"Two cellular proteins, NPI-1 and NPI-3, were previously identified through their interaction with the influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) by using the yeast two-hybrid system. These proteins were then shown to act as general transport factors (karyopherin alpha) and nuclear pore-docking proteins to facilitate the transport of the NP and of viral RNA into the nucleus. The yeast two-hybrid assay has now been used to identify the specific domains on the NP that bind to the NPI proteins. Mutational analysis including alanine scanning identified the motifs SxGTKRSYxxM and TKRSxxxM, which are required for binding to NPI-1 and NPI-3, respectively. These sequences were shown to possess nuclear localization signal (NLS) activity following expression of fusion proteins in HeLa cells. These sequences represent a novel nonconventional NLS motif. Another NLS activity not mediated by the NPI binding sites is associated with noncontiguous sequences in the NP."
16698996,Ebola virus VP24 binds karyopherin alpha1 and blocks STAT1 nuclear accumulation.,"Ebola virus (EBOV) infection blocks cellular production of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) and the ability of cells to respond to IFN-alpha/beta or IFN-gamma. The EBOV VP35 protein has previously been identified as an EBOV-encoded inhibitor of IFN-alpha/beta production. However, the mechanism by which EBOV infection inhibits responses to IFNs has not previously been defined. Here we demonstrate that the EBOV VP24 protein functions as an inhibitor of IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma signaling. Expression of VP24 results in an inhibition of IFN-induced gene expression and an inability of IFNs to induce an antiviral state. The VP24-mediated inhibition of cellular responses to IFNs correlates with the impaired nuclear accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 (PY-STAT1), a key step in both IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma signaling. Consistent with this proposed function for VP24, infection of cells with EBOV also confers a block to the IFN-induced nuclear accumulation of PY-STAT1. Further, VP24 is found to specifically interact with karyopherin alpha1, the nuclear localization signal receptor for PY-STAT1, but not with karyopherin alpha2, alpha3, or alpha4. Overexpression of VP24 results in a loss of karyopherin alpha1-PY-STAT1 interaction, indicating that the VP24-karyopherin alpha1 interaction contributes to the block to IFN signaling. These data suggest that VP24 is likely to be an important virulence determinant that allows EBOV to evade the antiviral effects of IFNs."
15156567,Functional domains of APOBEC3G required for antiviral activity.,"The viral protein, Vif, is essential for the production of infectious progeny virions in natural target cells of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Several recent reports indicate that Vif acts by antagonizing the activity of an endogenous human antiviral protein, APOBEC3G. To investigate this route to restrict HIV-1 infection, we employed mutagenesis to assess APOBEC3G function during HIV-1 infection including interaction with Vif, localization, and activity in virions. We found that APOBEC3G binds Vif in infected cells and the C'-terminal region is required for this interaction. APOBEC3G was only incorporated into virions in the absence of Vif and deletion of either the N'-terminal or C'-terminal regions of APOBEC3G abrogated virion localization. Assaying endogenous reverse transcription we found that APOBEC3G and its C'-terminal deletion mutant inhibited full-length cDNA synthesis, possibly through binding to viral RNA, a function revealed through gel-shift assays. Taken together, our studies suggest that APOBEC3G inhibits HIV-1 infection through interference with reverse transcription and that Vif counteracts APOBEC3G by impeding its entry into virions."
8473314,Phosphorylation of HIV-1 gag proteins by protein kinase C.,"We have demonstrated that the 17-kDa N-terminal matrix protein (p17gag) of HIV-1 Pr55gag is a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC). Phosphorylation of p17gag and Pr55gag was studied in vivo by infecting COS-7 cells with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the HIV-1 gag-pol gene. Basal gag protein phosphorylation was inhibited up to 75% with the PKC inhibitor, H-7, and stimulated 3-4-fold with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. In experiments using MCF-7 cell lines, p17gag and Pr55gag were dramatically phosphorylated only in clones with high PKC activity. Bacterially expressed and purified non-myristoylated and N-myristoylated p17gag were efficiently phosphorylated in a Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine-dependent manner by purified PKC. The N-myristoylated p17gag exhibited an apparent Km = 4 microM for PKC phosphorylation. Both in vitro and in vivo phosphorylated p17gag yielded identical V8 protease digestion phosphopeptide maps, indicating identical PKC phosphorylation sites. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the in vitro phosphorylated p17gag revealed only phosphoserine. These data are consistent with the identification of a highly conserved consensus PKC phosphorylation site motif in the HIV-1 gag protein at Ser111 and suggests that PKC phosphorylation plays an important role in gag protein function."
7969494,Specific incorporation of cyclophilin A into HIV-1 virions.,"Little is known about host factors necessary for retroviral virion assembly or uncoating. We have previously shown that the principal structural protein of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1, the Gag polyprotein, binds the cyclophilin peptidyl-prolyl isomerases; cyclophilins catalyse a rate-limiting step in protein folding and protect cells from heat shock. Here we demonstrate that cyclophilin A is specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virions but not into virions of other primate immunodeficiency viruses. A proline-rich region conserved in all HIV-1 Gag polyproteins is required for cyclophilin A binding and incorporation. Disruption of a single proline blocks the Gag-cyclophilin interaction in vitro, prevents cyclophilin A incorporation into virions, and inhibits HIV-1 replication. Our results indicate that the interaction of Gag with cyclophilin A is necessary for the formation of infectious HIV-1 virions."
11160734,Human GLI-2 is a tat activation response element-independent Tat cofactor.,"Zinc finger-containing GLI proteins are involved in the development of Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus, Drosophila, zebrafish, mice, and humans. In this study, we show that an isoform of human GLI-2 strongly synergizes with the Tat transactivating proteins of human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and -2) and markedly stimulates viral replication. GLI-2 also synergizes with the previously described Tat cofactor cyclin T1 to stimulate Tat function. Surprisingly, GLI-2/Tat synergy is not dependent on either a typical GLI DNA binding site or an intact Tat activation response element but does require an intact TATA box. Thus, GLI-2/Tat synergy results from a mechanism of action which is novel both for a GLI protein and for a Tat cofactor. These findings link the GLI family of transcriptional and developmental regulatory proteins to Tat function and HIV replication."
9514931,Interaction of the second coding exon of Tat with human EF-1 delta delineates a mechanism for HIV-1-mediated shut-off of host mRNA translation.,"HIV-1 Tat has pleiotropic functions. While its most studied role is to activate transcription from the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR)-promoter, Tat also has functions as a secretable growth factor, a T-cell activator, and an inducer of cellular apoptosis, amongst others. For its transcriptional function, the first coding exon of Tat appears wholly sufficient; however, lentiviruses (HIVs and SIVs) maintain and conserve a second coding exon for Tat. While the function(s) of the second exon of Tat has remained largely unknown, its integrity in lentiviral genomes suggests biological importance, possibly a role in non-transcriptional activities. To understand better the biology of the second exon of Tat in HIV-1 infection of cells, we have searched for cellular proteins that bind specifically to this protein domain. Here, we report that the human translation elongation factor 1-delta (EF-1 delta) binds to the second exon of HIV-1 Tat. Interaction between Tat and EF-1 delta dramatically reduces the efficiency of the translation of cellular, but not viral, mRNAs. These findings suggest that a non-transcriptional activity of Tat modulates cellular protein synthesis, thereby affecting the metabolism of host cells."
8754820,Protein sequence requirements for function of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Rex nuclear export signal delineated by a novel in vivo randomization-selection assay.,"The Rex protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, like the functionally equivalent Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, contains a leucine-rich activation domain that specifically interacts with the human nucleoporin-like Rab/hRIP cofactor. Here, this Rex sequence is shown to function also as a protein nuclear export signal (NES). Rex sequence libraries containing randomized forms of the activation domain/NES were screened for retention of the ability to bind Rab/hRIP by using the yeast two-hybrid assay. While the selected sequences differed widely in primary sequence, all were functional as Rex activation domains. In contrast, randomized sequences that failed to bind Rab/hRIP lacked Rex activity. The selected sequences included one with homology to the Rev activation domain/NES and a second that was similar to the NES found in the cellular protein kinase inhibitor alpha. A highly variant, yet fully active, activation domain sequence selected on the basis of Rab/hRIP binding retained full NES function even though this sequence preserved only a single leucine residue. In contrast, nonfunctional activation domain mutants that were unable to bind Rab/hRIP had also lost NES function. These data demonstrate that NES activity is a defining characteristic of the activation domains found in the Rev/Rex class of retroviral regulatory proteins and strongly support the hypothesis that the Rab/hRIP cofactor plays a critical role in mediating the biological activity of these NESs. In addition, these data suggest a consensus sequence for NESs of the Rev/Rex class."
15140951,Nuclear translocation of papillomavirus minor capsid protein L2 requires Hsc70.,"Minor capsid protein L2 of papillomaviruses plays an essential role in virus assembly by recruiting viral components to PML bodies, the proposed sites of virus morphogenesis. We demonstrate here that the function of L2 in virus assembly requires the chaperone Hsc70. Hsc70 was found dispersed in naturally infected keratinocytes and cultured cells. A dramatic relocation of Hsc70 from the cytoplasm to PML bodies was induced in these cells by L2 expression. Hsc70-L2 complex formation was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. The complex was modulated by the cochaperones Hip and Bag-1, which stabilize and destabilize Hsc70-substrate complexes, respectively. Cytoplasmic depletion of Hsc70 caused retention of wild-type and N-terminally truncated L2, but not of C-terminally truncated L2, in the cytoplasm. This retention was partially reversed by overexpression of Hsc70 fused to green fluorescent protein but not by ATPase-negative Hsc70. Hsc70 associated with L1-L2 virus-like particles (VLPs) but not with VLPs composed either of L1 alone or of L1 and C-terminally truncated L2. Moreover, displacement of Hsc70 from L1-L2 VLPs by encapsidation of DNA, generating pseudovirions, was found. These data indicate that Hsc70 transiently associates with viral capsids during the integration of L2, possibly via the L2 C terminus. Completion of virus assembly results in displacement of Hsc70 from virions."
9371615,Infectivity enhancement by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef is independent of its association with a cellular serine/threonine kinase.,"Nef proteins from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolate SF2 (HIV-1SF2) and simian immunodeficiency virus isolate mac239 (SIVmac239) have been found to associate with a cellular serine/threonine kinase designated NAK. We have recently shown that the association of Nef with NAK is isolate dependent. To identify the structural basis for Nef-kinase association, several chimeric molecules were constructed between SF2 Nef (binding NAK) and 233 Nef (a primary isolate not binding NAK) and stably expressed in HuT-78 human T cells via retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. The Nef 233/SF2/SF2 chimera in which the N-terminal 37 amino acids of SF2 Nef were replaced by those of 233 Nef showed the same ability as SF2 Nef to bind NAK. The Nef 233/SF2/233 chimera in which the N-terminal 37 amino acids and the C-terminal 72 amino acids of SF2 Nef were replaced by corresponding sequences from 233 Nef completely lost the ability to associate with the kinase activity. Furthermore, replacement of the C-terminal 72 amino acids of 233 Nef with the equivalent SF2 sequence (chimera 233/233/SF2) fully restored kinase association to 233 Nef. These results suggest that (i) the core of Nef is not sufficient for NAK binding, (ii) the C terminus of SF2 Nef contains structural determinants important for association with NAK, and (iii) the failure of 233 Nef to bind NAK is due to a defect in its C terminus. Taking advantage of the C terminus of 233 Nef being nonfunctional and using an infectious clone of HIV-1SF2, we show that association with NAK is not required for Nef-mediated infectivity enhancement. While the strong and reproducible association of some Nef isolates with NAK has been clearly established, the role of NAK in Nef function remains to be fully elucidated."
15194748,Tax relieves transcriptional repression by promoting histone deacetylase 1 release from the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 long terminal repeat.,"Expression of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is regulated by the viral transcriptional activator Tax. Tax activates viral transcription through interaction with the cellular transcription factor CREB and the coactivators CBP/p300. In this study, we have analyzed the role of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) on HTLV-1 gene expression from an integrated template. First we show that trichostatin A, an HDAC inhibitor, enhances Tax expression in HTLV-1-transformed cells. Second, using a cell line containing a single-copy HTLV-1 long terminal repeat, we demonstrate that overexpression of HDAC1 represses Tax transactivation. Furthermore, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay allowed us to analyze the interaction of transcription factors, coactivators, and HDACs with the basal and activated HTLV-1 promoter. We demonstrate that HDAC1 is associated with the inactive, but not the Tax-transactivated, HTLV-1 promoter. In vitro and in vivo glutathione S-transferase-Tax pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that there is a direct physical association between Tax and HDAC1. Importantly, biotinylated chromatin pull-down assays demonstrated that Tax inhibits and/or dissociates the binding of HDAC1 to the HTLV-1 promoter. Our results provide evidence that Tax interacts directly with HDAC1 and regulates binding of the repressor to the HTLV-1 promoter."
11689886,HIV-1 Nef associated PAK and PI3-kinases stimulate Akt-independent Bad-phosphorylation to induce anti-apoptotic signals.,"A highly conserved signaling property of Nef proteins encoded by human or simian immunodeficiency virus is the binding and activation of a PAK kinase whose function is unclear. Here we show that Nef-mediated p21-activated kinase (PAK) activation involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which acts upstream of PAK and is bound and activated by Nef similar to the manner of Polyoma virus middle T antigen. The Nef-associated phosphatidylinositol-3-PAK complex phosphorylated the pro-apoptotic Bad protein without involving the protein kinase B-Akt kinase, which is generally believed to inactivate Bad by serine phosphorylation. Consequently, Nef, but not a Nef mutant incapable of activating PAK, blocked apoptosis in T cells induced by serum starvation or HIV replication. Nef anti-apoptotic effects are likely a crucial mechanism for viral replication in the host and thus in AIDS pathogenesis."
16227255,"In nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 interacts with galectin 9 in membrane raft elements resistant to simvastatin.","Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) are etiologically related to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and malignant NPC cells have consistent although heterogeneous expression of the EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). LMP1 trafficking and signaling require its incorporation into membrane rafts. Conversely, raft environment is likely to modulate LMP1 activity. In order to investigate NPC-specific raft partners of LMP1, rafts derived from the C15 NPC xenograft were submitted to preparative immunoprecipitation of LMP1 combined with mass spectrometry analysis of coimmunoprecipitated proteins. Through this procedure, galectin 9, a beta-galactoside binding lectin and Hodgkin tumor antigen, was identified as a novel LMP1 partner. LMP1 interaction with galectin 9 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting in whole-cell extracts of NPC and EBV-transformed B cells (lymphoblastoid cell lines [LCLs]). Using mutant proteins expressed in HeLa cells, LMP1 was shown to bind galectin 9 in a TRAF3-independent manner. Galectin 9 is abundant in NPC biopsies as well as in LCLs, whereas it is absent in Burkitt lymphoma cells. In subsequent experiments, NPC cells were treated with Simvastatin, a drug reported to dissociate LMP1 from membrane rafts in EBV-transformed B cells. We found no significant effects of Simvastatin on the distribution of LMP1 and galectin 9 in NPC cell rafts. However, Simvastatin was highly cytotoxic for NPC cells, regardless of the presence or absence of LMP1. This suggests that Simvastatin is a potentially useful agent for the treatment of NPCs although it has distinct mechanisms of action in NPC and LCL cells."
17362635,[Screening proteins in hepatocytes interacting with the middle surface protein of hepatitis B virus using the yeast-two hybrid technique].,To screen proteins in hepatocytes interacting with hepatitis B virus surface antigen middle protein (MHBs) with yeast-two hybrid technique for studying the biological functions of MHBs.
7483296,HBx protein of hepatitis B virus interacts with the C-terminal portion of a novel human proteasome alpha-subunit.,"Two-hybrid protein interaction screening in yeast was used to identify proteins that interact with the HBx nonstructural protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV). A new human member of the proteasome alpha-subunit family was obtained. Its protein sequence closely resembles the 28 kD subunits from other organisms. The interaction with HBx was abolished by a two amino-acid insertion behind position 128 in HBx, in a region previously found to be essential for its transcriptional transactivation function. These data support a model of HBx acting indirectly on transcriptional processes. By binding to a specific proteasome alpha-subunit, HBx might interfere with degradative processes, thereby enhancing the half-life of different transcription factors and other nuclear regulatory proteins. Interaction with the Hu 28k proteasome subunit could thus provide a unifying explanation for the markedly pleiotropic effects of HBx."
15107832,Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax interacts with Chk1 and attenuates DNA-damage induced G2 arrest mediated by Chk1.,"Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) mediates diverse cellular responses to genotoxic stress, regulating the network of genome-surveillance pathways that coordinate cell cycle progression with DNA repair. Chk1 is essential for mammalian development and viability, and has been shown to be important for both S and G(2) checkpoints. We now present evidence that the HTLV-1 Tax protein interacts directly with Chk1 and impairs its kinase activities in vitro and in vivo. The direct and physical interaction of Chk1 and Tax was observed in HTLV-1-infected T cells (C81, HuT 102 and MT-2) and transfected fibroblasts (293 T) by coimmunoprecipitation and by in vitro GST pull-down assays. Interestingly, Tax inhibited the kinase activity of Chk1 protein in in vitro and in vivo kinase assays. Consistent with these results, Tax inhibited the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of Cdc25A and G(2) arrest in response to gamma-irradiation (IR) in a dose-dependent manner in vivo. The G(2) arrest did not require Chk2 or p53. These studies provide the first example of a viral transforming protein targeting Chk1 and provide important insights into checkpoint pathway regulation."
11907223,"Functional interaction between JC virus late regulatory agnoprotein and cellular Y-box binding transcription factor, YB-1.","Human polyomavirus JC virus (JCV) is a causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy which results from lytic infection of glial cells. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the regulation of JCV gene transcription, the mechanism(s) underlying the viral lytic cycle remains largely unknown. We recently reported that the JCV late auxiliary Agnoprotein may have a regulatory role in JCV gene transcription and replication. Here, we investigated its regulatory function in viral gene transcription through its physical and functional interaction with YB-1, a cellular transcription factor which contributes to JCV gene expression in glial cells. Time course studies revealed that Agnoprotein is first detected at day 3 postinfection and that its level increased during the late stage of the infection cycle. Agnoprotein is mainly localized to the cytoplasmic compartment of the infected cell, with high concentrations found in the perinuclear region. While the position of Agnoprotein throughout the infection cycle remained relatively unaltered, the subcellular distribution of YB-1 between the cytoplasm and nucleus changed. Results from coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments revealed that Agnoprotein physically interacts with YB-1 and that the amino-terminal region of Agnoprotein, between residues 1 and 36, is critical for this association. Further investigation of this interaction by functional assays demonstrated that Agnoprotein negatively regulates YB-1-mediated gene transcription and that the region corresponding to residues 1 to 36 of Agnoprotein is important for the observed regulatory event. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the interaction of the viral late regulatory Agnoprotein and cellular Y-box binding factor YB-1 modulates transcriptional activity of JCV promoters."
10574946,The HIV Nef protein alters Ca(2+) signaling in myelomonocytic cells through SH3-mediated protein-protein interactions.,"Human immunodeficiency virus Nef plays an important role in AIDS pathogenesis. In addition to the well known down-regulation of cell surface receptors (CD4, MHCI), Nef is able to alter cellular signaling. Of particular interest for this study is the ability of Nef to bind with a very high affinity to SH3 domains of myelomonocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinases of the Src family (Src-like PTK). We have therefore investigated Ca(2+) signaling in HL60 cells retrovirally transduced with wild type Nef or with a Nef mutant deficient in the SH3-interacting proline-rich motif (Nef((PXXP)4(-))). In differentiated HL60 cells, Nef markedly altered cellular Ca(2+) signaling; the amount of intracellularly stored Ca(2+) was increased, and as a consequence, store-operated Ca(2+)-influx was decreased. This effect was not observed in undifferentiated HL60 cells or in CEM T-lymphocytes and correlated with the differentiation-induced up-regulation of Src-like PTK. The Nef effect on Ca(2+) signaling depended entirely on the integrity of its PXXP motif. The Src-like PTK p56/59(hck) co-immunoprecipitated with both Nef and with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, providing a possible mechanistic link between the viral protein and intracellular Ca(2+) stores of the host cell. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the human immunodeficiency virus 1 Nef protein manipulates intracellular Ca(2+) stores through SH3-mediated interactions in myelomonocytic cells."
9811718,Zeta chain of the T-cell receptor interacts with nef of simian immunodeficiency virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 2.,"A truncated version of the nef gene of simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 capable of encoding amino acids 98 to 263 was used as bait to screen a cDNA library from activated lymphocytes in a yeast two-hybrid system. The zeta chain of the T-cell receptor (TCRzeta) was found to interact specifically not only with truncated SIV nef in yeast cells but also with full-length glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SIVnef fusion protein in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitation of TCRzeta with full-length SIV nef was demonstrated in transfected Jurkat cells and in Cos 18 cells which express the cytoplasmic domain of TCRzeta fused to the external domain of CD8 via the CD8 transmembrane domain. Using a series of nef deletion mutants, we have mapped the binding site within the central core domain of nef (amino acids 98 to 235). Binding of TCRzeta was specific for nef isolated from SIVmac239, SIVsmH4, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-2ST and was not detected with nef from five different HIV-1 isolates. An active tyrosine kinase was coprecipitated with nef-TCRzeta complexes from Jurkat cells but not from J.CAM1.6 cells which lack a functional Lck tyrosine kinase. These results demonstrate a specific association of SIV and HIV-2 nef, but not HIV-1 nef, with TCRzeta."
10708598,CBP: A target molecule of HTLV-1 Tax in synoviocyte activation.,"Previous studies have shown that human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax is a key molecule of synoviocyte activation in HTLV-1 associated arthropathy (HAAP). To clarify the molecular mechanism of HTLV-1 Tax-induced transcriptional activation in synoviocytes from HAAP, we investigated the role of cyclicAMP (cAMP)-regulated enhancer (CRE) binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), as a target molecule of HTLV-1 Tax. Activation of cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase-A (PK-A) pathway resulted in a significantly high response of CRE promoter in synoviocytes from patients with HAAP as well as in Tax-transiently transfected synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Mammalian two-hybrid analysis showed that the recruitment of CBP was responsible for CREB activation. Furthermore, PK-A activation induced CBP-Tax complex in synoviocytes from HAAP and the complex contained CREB. These findings demonstrated that complex formation of CBP and Tax is critical for enhanced CREB activity in synoviocytes from HAAP."
9315662,"CA150, a nuclear protein associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, is involved in Tat-activated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription.","Maximal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression requires specific cellular factors in addition to the virus-encoded trans-activator protein Tat and the RNA element TAR. We developed a functional assay, based on transcriptional activation in vitro, to identify these cellular factors. Here, we describe the purification and molecular cloning of CA150, a nuclear protein that is associated with the human RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and is involved in Tat-dependent HIV-1 transcriptional activation. The sequence of CA150 contains an extensive glutamine- and alanine-rich repeat that is found in transcriptional modulators such as GAL11 and SSN6 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zeste in Drosophila melanogaster. Immunodepletion of CA150 abolished Tat trans activation in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of a mutant CA150 protein specifically and dramatically decreased Tat-mediated activation of the HIV-1 promoter in vivo, strongly suggesting a role for CA150 in HIV-1 gene regulation. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both CA150 and Tat associate with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Furthermore, we found that functional Tat associates with the holoenzyme whereas activation-deficient Tat mutants do not. Thus, we propose that Tat action is transduced via an RNA polymerase II holoenzyme that contains CA150."
17652388,Emerin is hyperphosphorylated and redistributed in herpes simplex virus type 1-infected cells in a manner dependent on both UL34 and US3.,"Cells infected with wild-type herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) show disruption of the organization of the nuclear lamina that underlies the nuclear envelope. This disruption is reflected in changes in the localization and phosphorylation of lamin proteins. Here, we show that HSV-1 infection causes relocalization of the LEM domain protein emerin. In cells infected with wild-type virus, emerin becomes more mobile in the nuclear membrane, and in cells infected with viruses that fail to express UL34 protein (pUL34) and US3 protein (pUS3), emerin no longer colocalizes with lamins, suggesting that infection causes a loss of connection between emerin and the lamina. Infection causes hyperphosphorylation of emerin in a manner dependent upon both pUL34 and pUS3. Some emerin hyperphosphorylation can be inhibited by the protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) inhibitor rottlerin. Emerin and pUL34 interact physically, as shown by pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Emerin expression is not, however, necessary for infection, since virus growth is not impaired in cells derived from emerin-null transgenic mice. The results suggest a model in which pUS3 and PKCdelta that has been recruited by pUL34 hyperphosphorylate emerin, leading to disruption of its connections with lamin proteins and contributing to the disruption of the nuclear lamina. Changes in emerin localization, nuclear shape, and lamin organization characteristic of cells infected with wild-type HSV-1 also occur in cells infected with recombinant virus that does not make viral capsids, suggesting that these changes occur independently of capsid envelopment."
11448168,Inhibition of cellular functions of HIV-1 Nef by artificial SH3 domains.,"SH3 domains regulate many normal and pathological cellular processes by guiding specific protein interactions. Studies on binding of HIV-1 Nef to the SH3 domain of the Hck tyrosine kinase have indicated an important role for the SH3 RT-loop region in ligand binding. Here we have tested the potential of artificial Hck-derived SH3 domains carrying tailored RT-loops providing high affinity for Nef as intracellular inhibitors of Nef. These artificial SH3 domains efficiently associated with Nef in cells and thereby potently inhibited SH3-dependent Nef functions, such as association with p21-activated kinase-2 and induction of the transcription factor NFAT. On the other hand, biochemical and functional data indicated that the Nef-targeted SH3 domains were not prone to compete with normal SH3-mediated processes. Thus, RT-loop-modified SH3 domains represent a novel approach for selectively interfering with cellular signaling events, which could be exploited in research as well as in therapeutic applications."
8946838,The angiogenesis induced by HIV-1 tat protein is mediated by the Flk-1/KDR receptor on vascular endothelial cells.,"The HIV-1 Tat protein transactivates HIV, viral and some host cell genes. Tat can be released by infected cells and acts extracellularly in the microenvironment, regulating functions of immunocompetent and mesenchymal cells. One of the most striking effects of Tat is the induction of a functional program in vascular cells related to angiogenesis and inflammation (migration, proliferation and expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and E selectin). Tat induces growth of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) spindle cells and is angiogenic in vivo and in transgenic mice10-12. We previously reported that Tat is a direct angiogenic factor and noted the Tat arginine- and lysine-rich sequence is similar to that of other potent angiogenic growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). It is possible that Tat mimics one of these factors by interacting with its growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor. Here we demonstrate that Tat specifically binds and activates the Flk-1/kinase insert domain receptor (Flk-1/KDR), a VEGF-A tyrosine kinase receptor (for review see ref. 13), and that Tat-induced angiogenesis is blocked by agents blocking the Flk-1/KDR receptor. Endothelial cell stimulation by Tat occurs in the absence of activation of FLT-1, another VEGF-A tyrosine kinase receptor."
12114499,HIV-1 Tat interaction with RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) and a dynamic association with CDK2 induce CTD phosphorylation and transcription from HIV-1 promoter.,"Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), Tat protein activates viral gene expression through promoting transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). In this process Tat enhances phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII by activating cell cycle-dependent kinases (CDKs) associated with general transcription factors of the promoter complex, specifically CDK7 and CDK9. We reported a Tat-associated T-cell-derived kinase, which contained CDK2. Here, we provide further evidence that CDK2 is involved in Tat-mediated CTD phosphorylation and in HIV-1 transcription in vitro. Tat-mediated CTD phosphorylation by CDK2 required cysteine 22 in the activation domain of Tat and amino acids 42-72 of Tat. CDK2 phosphorylated Tat itself, apparently by forming dynamic contacts with amino acids 15-24 and 36-49 of Tat. Also, amino acids 24-36 and 45-72 of Tat interacted with CTD. CDK2 associated with RNAPII and was found in elongation complexes assembled on HIV-1 long-terminal repeat template. Recombinant CDK2/cyclin E stimulated Tat-dependent HIV-1 transcription in reconstituted transcription assay. Immunodepletion of CDK2/cyclin E in HeLa nuclear extract blocked Tat-dependent transcription. We suggest that CDK2 is part of a transcription complex that is required for Tat-dependent transcription and that interaction of Tat with CTD and a dynamic association of Tat with CDK2/cyclin E stimulated CTD phosphorylation by CDK2."
23853584,The interactomes of influenza virus NS1 and NS2 proteins identify new host factors and provide insights for ADAR1 playing a supportive role in virus replication.,"Influenza A NS1 and NS2 proteins are encoded by the RNA segment 8 of the viral genome. NS1 is a multifunctional protein and a virulence factor while NS2 is involved in nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes. A yeast two-hybrid screening strategy was used to identify host factors supporting NS1 and NS2 functions. More than 560 interactions between 79 cellular proteins and NS1 and NS2 proteins from 9 different influenza virus strains have been identified. These interacting proteins are potentially involved in each step of the infectious process and their contribution to viral replication was tested by RNA interference. Validation of the relevance of these host cell proteins for the viral replication cycle revealed that 7 of the 79 NS1 and/or NS2-interacting proteins positively or negatively controlled virus replication. One of the main factors targeted by NS1 of all virus strains was double-stranded RNA binding domain protein family. In particular, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) appeared as a pro-viral host factor whose expression is necessary for optimal viral protein synthesis and replication. Surprisingly, ADAR1 also appeared as a pro-viral host factor for dengue virus replication and directly interacted with the viral NS3 protein. ADAR1 editing activity was enhanced by both viruses through dengue virus NS3 and influenza virus NS1 proteins, suggesting a similar virus-host co-evolution."
12235365,The membrane trafficking protein calpactin forms a complex with bluetongue virus protein NS3 and mediates virus release.,"Bluetongue virus, an arbovirus of the Orbivirus genus, infects and replicates in both insect and mammalian cells. However, the cytopathic effect (cpe) on each host is very different. Mammalian cells show substantial cpe, most likely a result of the mechanism of virus release, whereas insect cells show little cpe and appear to release virus without cell lysis. Expression analysis of each infected cell type shows one protein, the nonstructural (NS) protein NS3, to be differentially expressed in the different cell types, suggesting it may act in the virus egress pathway. The molecular basis of such an interaction, however, has never been clear. Here, by using yeast two-hybrid analysis, we show that NS3 interacts with a cellular protein p11 (calpactin light chain), part of the annexin II complex that is involved in exocytosis. We map the NS3 region of interaction with p11 to a 13-residue peptide found at the N terminus of the protein and show it effectively competes with p36 (annexin II heavy chain) for p11 ligand binding. Further, we show that the C-terminal domain of NS3 interacts with VP2, the outermost protein of the fully assembled virus particle, suggesting that NS3 forms a bridging molecule that draws assembled virus into contact with the cellular export machinery. Our data describe the first host protein involvement in orbivirus egress and provide new insights into understanding arbovirus interactions with their hosts."
22258240,Mapping of Chikungunya virus interactions with host proteins identified nsP2 as a highly connected viral component.,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that has been responsible for an epidemic outbreak of unprecedented magnitude in recent years. Since then, significant efforts have been made to better understand the biology of this virus, but we still have poor knowledge of CHIKV interactions with host cell components at the molecular level. Here we describe the extensive use of high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (HT-Y2H) assays to characterize interactions between CHIKV and human proteins. A total of 22 high-confidence interactions, which essentially involved the viral nonstructural protein nsP2, were identified and further validated in protein complementation assay (PCA). These results were integrated to a larger network obtained by extensive mining of the literature for reports on alphavirus-host interactions. To investigate the role of cellular proteins interacting with nsP2, gene silencing experiments were performed in cells infected by a recombinant CHIKV expressing Renilla luciferase as a reporter. Collected data showed that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) and ubiquilin 4 (UBQLN4) participate in CHIKV replication in vitro. In addition, we showed that CHIKV nsP2 induces a cellular shutoff, as previously reported for other Old World alphaviruses, and determined that among binding partners identified by yeast two-hybrid methods, the tetratricopeptide repeat protein 7B (TTC7B) plays a significant role in this activity. Altogether, this report provides the first interaction map between CHIKV and human proteins and describes new host cell proteins involved in the replication cycle of this virus."
10438867,Nuclear export factor CRM1 interacts with nonstructural proteins NS2 from parvovirus minute virus of mice.,"The nonstructural NS2 proteins of autonomous parvoviruses are known to act in a host cell-dependent manner and to play a role in viral DNA replication, efficient translation of viral mRNA, and/or encapsidation. Their exact function during the parvovirus life cycle remains, however, still obscure. We report here the characterization of the interaction with the NS2 proteins from the parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM) and rat as well as mouse homologues of the human CRM1 protein, a member of the importin-beta family recently identified as an essential nuclear export factor. Using the two-hybrid system, we could detect the interaction between the carboxy-terminal region of rat CRM1 and each of the three isoforms of NS2 (P [or major], Y [or minor], and L [or rare]). NS2 proteins were further shown to interact with the full-length CRM1 by coimmunoprecipitation experiments using extracts from both mouse and rat cell lines. Our data show that CRM1 preferentially binds to the nonphosphorylated isoforms of NS2. Moreover, we observed that the treatment of MVM-infected cells with leptomycin B, a drug that specifically inhibits the CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway, leads to a drastic accumulation of NS2 proteins in the nucleus. Both NS2 interaction with CRM1 and nuclear accumulation upon leptomycin B treatment strongly suggest that these nonstructural viral proteins are actively exported out of the nuclei of infected cells via a CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway."
17287294,"Rabies virus matrix protein interplay with eIF3, new insights into rabies virus pathogenesis.","Viral proteins are frequently multifunctional to accommodate the high density of information encoded in viral genomes. Matrix (M) protein of negative-stranded RNA viruses such as Rhabdoviridae is one such example. Its primary function is virus assembly/budding but it is also involved in the switch from viral transcription to replication and the concomitant down regulation of host gene expression. In this study we undertook a search for potential rabies virus (RV) M protein's cellular partners. In a yeast two-hybrid screen the eIF3h subunit was identified as an M-interacting cellular factor, and the interaction was validated by co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance assays. Upon expression in mammalian cell cultures, RV M protein was localized in early small ribosomal subunit fractions. Further, M protein added in trans inhibited in vitro translation on mRNA encompassing classical (Kozak-like) 5'-UTRs. Interestingly, translation of hepatitis C virus IRES-containing mRNA, which recruits eIF3 via a different noncanonical mechanism, was unaffected. Together, the data suggest that, as a complement to its functions in virus assembly/budding and regulation of viral transcription, RV M protein plays a role in inhibiting translation in virus-infected cells through a protein-protein interaction with the cellular translation machinery."
9820147,Association of simian immunodeficiency virus Nef with the T-cell receptor (TCR) zeta chain leads to TCR down-modulation.,"The Nef protein of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is dispensable for replication in established T-cell lines but essential for high level virus replication in the adult host, though the mechanism by which Nef contributes to this has remained unclear. We demonstrate here that SIV Nef binds to the zeta chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR). SIV Nef proteins that interact with TCR zeta in a yeast two-hybrid system also reduce T-cell surface expression levels of TCR alphabeta, CD3 and CD4. These findings are the first demonstration that Nef can bind directly to a component of the TCR-CD3 complex and modulate its surface expression."
10438814,RhoA interacts with the fusion glycoprotein of respiratory syncytial virus and facilitates virus-induced syncytium formation.,"The fusion glycoprotein (F) of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which mediates membrane fusion and virus entry, was shown to bind RhoA, a small GTPase, in yeast two-hybrid interaction studies. The interaction was confirmed in vivo by mammalian two-hybrid assay and in RSV-infected HEp-2 cells by coimmunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the interaction of F with RhoA was confirmed in vitro by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and biomolecular interaction analysis. Yeast two-hybrid interaction studies with various deletion mutants of F and with RhoA indicate that the key binding domains of these proteins are contained within, or overlap, amino acids 146 to 155 and 67 to 110, respectively. The biological significance of this interaction was studied in RSV-infected HEp-2 cells that were stably transfected to overexpress RhoA. There was a positive correlation between RhoA expression and RSV syncytium formation, indicating that RhoA can facilitate RSV-induced syncytium formation."
15503210,"VP1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and genome-linked protein of infectious bursal disease virus, interacts with the carboxy-terminal domain of translational eukaryotic initiation factor 4AII.","Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a member of the family Birnaviridae, is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus. Viral protein 1 (VP1), the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, occurs in virions both as a free polypeptide and as a genome-linked protein, called VPg. To gain more insight in its function, we initiated a yeast two-hybrid screen. With this approach we identified the carboxy-terminal domain of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4AII (eIF4AII) as an interactor for VP1. The association between these molecules was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation analyses. eIF4A plays an essential role in the initiation of translation of both capped and uncapped mRNAs. Its association with IBDV VP1 suggests an involvement of this viral protein in IBDV mRNA translation. An interaction between VP1 and full-length eIF4AII was, however, not observed. In view of the known two-domain structure of eIF4AII it is conceivable that the interaction of VP1 with full-length eIF4AII requires collaborating proteins that open up its structure and expose the VP1-binding site in the carboxy-terminal domain. The biological relevance of the potential VP1-eIF4AII interaction is discussed."
12917451,"Equine arteritis virus non-structural protein 1, an essential factor for viral subgenomic mRNA synthesis, interacts with the cellular transcription co-factor p100.","Non-structural protein 1 (nsp1), the N-terminal subunit of the replicase polyprotein of the arterivirus Equine arteritis virus (EAV), is essential for viral subgenomic mRNA synthesis, but fully dispensable for genome replication. However, at the molecular level, the role of nsp1 in EAV subgenomic mRNA synthesis is poorly understood. A yeast two-hybrid screen did not reveal interactions between EAV nsp1 and other viral non-structural proteins or the nucleocapsid protein, although both nsp1 and the nucleocapsid protein were found to form homomers. Subsequently, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library was performed using nsp1 as bait. Remarkably, this analysis revealed (potential) interactions between EAV nsp1 and factors that are involved in host cell transcriptional regulation. The interaction of nsp1 with one of these proteins, p100, a transcription co-activator that also interacts with regulatory proteins of other viruses, was confirmed by mutual co-immunoprecipitation from lysates of EAV-susceptible mammalian cells."
10760505,"An ARID family protein binds to the African swine fever virus encoded ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UBCv1.","The NH(2)-terminal end of a protein, named SMCp, which contains an ARID (A/T rich interaction domain) DNA binding domain and is similar to the mammalian SMCY/SMCX proteins and retinoblastoma binding protein 2, was shown to bind the African swine fever virus encoded ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UBCv1) using the yeast two hybrid system and in in vitro binding assays. Antisera raised against the SMCp protein were used to show that the protein is present in the cell nucleus. Immunofluorescence showed that although UBCv1 is present in the nucleus in most cells, in some cells it is in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The interaction and co-localisation of UBCv1 with SMCp suggest that SMCp may be a substrate in vivo for the enzyme."
9311891,The transactivation domain of adenovirus E1A interacts with the C terminus of human TAF(II)135.,"The CR3 activation domain of the human adenovirus E1A protein stimulates transcription by forming protein-protein interactions with DNA sequence-specific binding factors and components of the TFIID complex. Here, we demonstrate that CR3 can complex with the extreme C-terminal 105 amino acids of the human TATA box binding-factor-associated protein, hTAF(II)135. Furthermore, the C-terminal region of hTAF(II)135 can block transcriptional stimulation from an E1A-inducible promoter in vivo. This ability of the C terminus of hTAF(II)135 to bind CR3 and to inhibit E1A-inducible activation is highly specific. These results demonstrate for the first time that a discrete fragment of a mammalian TBP-associated factor which targets a specific activator can impair the stimulation of transcription."
19656971,Influenza A virus M1 blocks the classical complement pathway through interacting with C1qA.,"The matrix (M1) protein of influenza A virus is a conserved multifunctional protein that plays essential roles in regulating the viral life cycle. This study demonstrated that M1 is able to interact with complement C1qA and plays an important inhibitory function in the classical complement pathway. The N-terminal domain of M1 protein was required for its binding to the globular region of C1qA. As a consequence, M1 blocked the interaction between C1qA and heat-aggregated IgG in vitro and inhibited haemolysis. It was shown that M1 protein prevented the complement-mediated neutralization of influenza virus in vitro. In addition, studies on mice indicated that the administration of M1 could promote a higher virus propagation rate in lung and shortened survival of mice infected with the virus. Taken together, these results suggest strongly that the M1 protein plays a critical role in protecting influenza virus from the host innate immune system."
14645908,PABP1 and eIF4GI associate with influenza virus NS1 protein in viral mRNA translation initiation complexes.,"It has previously been shown that influenza virus NS1 protein enhances the translation of viral but not cellular mRNAs. This enhancement occurs by increasing the rate of translation initiation and requires the 5'UTR sequence, common to all viral mRNAs. In agreement with these findings, we show here that viral mRNAs, but not cellular mRNAs, are associated with NS1 during virus infection. We have previously reported that NS1 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF4GI, next to its poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1)-interacting domain and that NS1 and eIF4GI are associated in influenza virus-infected cells. Here we show that NS1, although capable of binding poly(A), does not compete with PABP1 for association with eIF4GI and, furthermore, that NS1 and PABP1 interact both in vivo and in vitro in an RNA-independent manner. The interaction maps between residues 365 and 535 in PABP1 and between residues 1 and 81 in NS1. These mapping studies, together with those previously reported for NS1-eIF4GI and PABP1-eIF4GI interactions, imply that the binding of all three proteins would be compatible. Collectively, these and previously published data suggest that NS1 interactions with eIF4GI and PABP1, as well as with viral mRNAs, could promote the specific recruitment of 43S complexes to the viral mRNAs."
17269724,Identification of cellular interaction partners of the influenza virus ribonucleoprotein complex and polymerase complex using proteomic-based approaches.,"Cellular factors that associate with the influenza A viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) are presumed to play important roles in the viral life cycle. To date, interaction screens using individual vRNP components, such as the nucleoprotein or viral polymerase subunits, have revealed few cellular interaction partners. To improve this situation, we performed comprehensive, proteomics-based screens to identify cellular factors associated with the native vRNP and viral polymerase complexes. Reconstituted vRNPs were purified from human cells using Strep-tagged viral nucleoprotein (NP-Strep) as bait, and co-purified cellular factors were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). In parallel, reconstituted native influenza A polymerase complexes were isolated using tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged polymerase subunits as bait, and co-purified cellular factors were again identified by MS. Using these techniques, we identified 41 proteins that co-purified with NP-Strep-enriched vRNPs and four cellular proteins that co-purified with the viral polymerase complex. Two of the polymerase-associated factors, importin-beta3 and PARP-1, represent novel interaction partners. Most cellular proteins previously shown to interact with either viral NP and/or vRNP were also identified using our method, demonstrating its sensitivity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies in virus-infected cells using selected novel interaction partners, including nucleophosmin (NPM), confirmed their association with vRNP. Immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that NPM is recruited to sites of viral transcription and replication in infected cells. Additionally, overexpression of NPM resulted in increased viral polymerase activity, indicating its role in viral RNA synthesis. In summary, the proteomics-based approaches used in this study represent powerful tools to identify novel vRNP-associated cellular factors for further characterization."
17686864,Fowlpox virus encodes a Bcl-2 homologue that protects cells from apoptotic death through interaction with the proapoptotic protein Bak.,"Poxviruses are renowned for encoding numerous immunomodulatory proteins capable of undermining potent immune defenses. One effective barrier against infection is apoptosis, a process controlled at the mitochondria by pro- and antiapoptotic members of the highly conserved Bcl-2 family of proteins. Although poxviruses are known to encode an array of effective inhibitors of apoptosis, members of the Avipoxvirus genus, which includes fowlpox virus, encode proteins with Bcl-2 homology. Here, we show that FPV039, a fowlpox virus protein with limited Bcl-2 homology, inhibited apoptosis in response to a variety of cytotoxic stimuli, including virus infection itself. Similar to other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, FPV039 localized predominantly to the mitochondria in both human and chicken cells and protected human cells from tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation revealed that FPV039 interacted constitutively with the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein, Bak, in both human and chicken cells. Concordantly, FPV039 also inhibited apoptosis induced by the transient overexpression of Bak. To confirm these results in the context of virus infection, we generated a recombinant vaccinia virus lacking F1L, the endogenous apoptotic inhibitor in vaccinia virus, and expressing FPV039. In the context of vaccinia virus infection, FPV039 retained the ability to localize to the mitochondria and interacted with Bak. Moreover, FPV039 prevented the activation of Bak and protected infected cells from apoptosis induced by staurosporine and virus infection. Together, our data indicate that FPV039 is a functional Bcl-2 homologue that inhibits apoptosis by neutralizing the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bak."
16474136,YRKL sequence of influenza virus M1 functions as the L domain motif and interacts with VPS28 and Cdc42.,"Earlier studies have shown that the C-terminal half of helix 6 (H6) of the influenza A virus matrix protein (M1) containing the YRKL sequence is involved in virus budding (E. K.-W. Hui, S. Barman, T. Y. Yang, and D. P. Nayak, J. Virol. 77:7078-7092, 2003). In this report, we show that the YRKL sequence is the L domain motif of influenza virus. Like other L domains, YRKL can be inserted at different locations on the mutant M1 protein and can restore virus budding in a position-independent manner. Although YRKL is a part of the nuclear localization signal (NLS), the function of YRKL was independent of the NLS activity and the NLS function of M1 was not required for influenza virus replication. Some mutations in YRKL and the adjacent region caused a reduction in the virus titer by blocking virus release, and some affected virus morphology, producing elongated particles. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses showed that VPS28, a component of the ESCRT-I complex, and Cdc42, a member of the Rho family GTP-binding proteins, interacted with the M1 protein via the YRKL motif. In addition, depletion of VPS28 and Cdc42 by small interfering RNA resulted in reduction of influenza virus production. Moreover, overexpression of dominant-negative Cdc42 inhibited influenza virus replication, whereas a constitutively active Cdc42 mutant enhanced virus production in infected cells. These results indicated that VPS28, a component of ESCRT-I, and Cdc42, a small G protein, are associated with the M1 protein and involved in the influenza virus life cycle."
17020941,Human papillomavirus type 5 E6 oncoprotein represses the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway by binding to SMAD3.,"Mechanisms of cellular transformation associated with human papillomavirus type 5 (HPV5), which is responsible for skin carcinomas in epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) patients, are poorly understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening and molecular and cellular biology experiments, we found that HPV5 oncoprotein E6 interacts with SMAD3, a key component in the transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) signaling pathway. HPV5 E6 inhibits SMAD3 transactivation by destabilizing the SMAD3/SMAD4 complex and inducing the degradation of both proteins. Interestingly, the E6 protein of nononcogenic EV HPV9 failed to interact with SMAD3, suggesting that downregulation of the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway could be a determinant in HPV5 skin carcinogenesis."
16840351,Ribosomal protein S6 associates with alphavirus nonstructural protein 2 and mediates expression from alphavirus messages.,"Although alphaviruses dramatically alter cellular function within hours of infection, interactions between alphaviruses and specific host cellular proteins are poorly understood. Although the alphavirus nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) is an essential component of the viral replication complex, it also has critical auxiliary functions that determine the outcome of infection in the host. To gain a better understanding of nsP2 function, we sought to identify cellular proteins with which Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus nsP2 interacted. We demonstrate here that nsP2 associates with ribosomal protein S6 (RpS6) and that nsP2 is present in the ribosome-containing fractions of a polysome gradient, suggesting that nsP2 associates with RpS6 in the context of the whole ribosome. This result was noteworthy, since viral replicase proteins have seldom been described in direct association with components of the ribosome. The association of RpS6 with nsP2 was detected throughout the course of infection, and neither the synthesis of the viral structural proteins nor the presence of the other nonstructural proteins was required for RpS6 interaction with nsP2. nsP1 also was associated with RpS6, but other nonstructural proteins were not. RpS6 phosphorylation was dramatically diminished within hours after infection with alphaviruses. Furthermore, a reduction in the level of RpS6 protein expression led to diminished expression from alphavirus subgenomic messages, whereas no dramatic diminution in cellular translation was observed. Taken together, these data suggest that alphaviruses alter the ribosome during infection and that this alteration may contribute to differential translation of host and viral messages."
11507219,"Borna disease virus phosphoprotein binds a neurite outgrowth factor, amphoterin/HMG-1.","The Borna disease virus (BDV) p24 phosphoprotein is an abundant protein in BDV-infected cultured cells and animal brains. Therefore, there is a possibility that binding of the p24 protein to cellular factor(s) induces functional alterations of infected neural cells in the brain. To identify a cellular protein(s) that interacts with BDV p24 protein, we performed far-Western blotting with extracts from various cell lines. Using recombinant p24 protein as a probe, we detected a 30-kDa protein in all cell lines examined. Binding between the 30-kDa and BDV p24 proteins was also demonstrated using BDV p24 affinity and ion-exchange chromatography columns. Microsequence analysis of the purified 30-kDa protein revealed that its N terminus showed complete homology with rat amphoterin protein, which is a neurite outgrowth factor abundant in the brain during development. Mammalian two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analyses also confirmed that amphoterin is a specific target for the p24 protein in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that infection by BDV, as well as purified p24 protein in the medium, significantly decreased cell process outgrowth of cells grown on laminin, indicating the functional inhibition of amphoterin by interaction with the p24 protein. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased levels of amphoterin protein at the leading edges of BDV-infected cells. Moreover, the expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products, of which the extracellular moiety is a receptor for amphoterin, was not significantly activated in BDV-infected cells during the process of extension, suggesting that the secretion of amphoterin from the cell surface is inhibited by the binding of the p24 protein. These results suggested that BDV infection may cause direct damage in the developing brain by inhibiting the function of amphoterin due to binding by the p24 phosphoprotein."
25290767,Structural and functional analysis of the fibronectin-binding protein FNE from Streptococcus equi spp. equi.,"Streptococcus equi is a horse pathogen belonging to Lancefield group C. Infection by S. equi ssp. equi causes strangles, a serious and highly contagious disease of the upper respiratory tract. S. equi ssp. equi secretes a fibronectin (Fn)-binding protein, FNE, that does not contain cell wall-anchoring motifs. FNE binds to the gelatin-binding domain (GBD) of Fn, composed of the motifs (6) FI (12) FII (789) FI . FNE lacks the canonical Fn-binding peptide repeats observed in many microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules. We found that the interaction between FNE and the human GBD is mediated by the binding of the disordered C-terminal region (residues 208-262) of FNE to the (789) FI GBD subfragment. The crystal structure of FNE showed that it is similar to the minor pilus protein Spy0125 of Streptococcus pyogenes, found at the end of pilus polymers and responsible for adhesion. FNE and Spy0125 both have a superimposable internal thioester bond between highly conserved Cys and Gln residues. Small-angle X-ray scattering of the FNE-(789) FI complex provided a model that aligns the C-terminal peptide of FNE with the E-strands of the FI domains, adopting the β-zipper extension model observed in previous structures of microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecule adhesion peptides bound to FI domains."
9847304,Targeting of the visna virus tat protein to AP-1 sites: interactions with the bZIP domains of fos and jun in vitro and in vivo.,"The visna virus Tat protein is required for efficient viral transcription from the visna virus long terminal repeat (LTR). AP-1 sites within the visna virus LTR, which can be bound by the cellular transcription factors Fos and Jun, are also necessary for Tat-mediated transcriptional activation. A potential mechanism by which the visna virus Tat protein could target the viral promoter is by protein-protein interactions with Fos and/or Jun bound to AP-1 sites in the visna virus LTR. Once targeted to the visna virus promoter, the Tat protein could then interact with basal transcription factors to activate transcription. To examine protein-protein interactions with cellular proteins at the visna virus promoter, we used an in vitro protein affinity chromatography assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, in addition to an in vivo two-hybrid assay, to show that the visna virus Tat protein specifically interacts with the cellular transcription factors Fos and Jun and the basal transcription factor TBP (TATA binding protein). The Tat domain responsible for interactions with Fos and Jun was localized to an alpha-helical domain within amino acids 34 to 69 of the protein. The TBP binding domain was localized to amino acids 1 to 38 of Tat, a region previously described by our laboratory as the visna virus Tat activation domain. The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun were found to be important for the interactions with Tat. Mutations within the basic domains of Fos and Jun abrogated binding to Tat in the in vitro assays. The visna virus Tat protein was also able to interact with covalently cross-linked Fos and Jun dimers. Thus, the visna virus Tat protein appears to target AP-1 sites in the viral promoter in a mechanism similar to the interaction of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax with the cellular transcription factor CREB, by binding the basic domains of an intact bZIP dimer. The association between Tat, Fos, and Jun would position Tat proximal to the viral TATA box, where the visna virus Tat activation domain could contact TBP to activate viral transcription."
9065443,Target protease specificity of the viral serpin CrmA. Analysis of five caspases.,"When ectopically expressed in animal cells, cytokine response modifier A (CrmA), a product of the cowpox virus, prevents programmed cell death initiated by a variety of stimuli. Since CrmA is a proteinase inhibitor, its target is probably a protease that promotes cell death. The identification of this target is crucial in delineating essential regulation points that modulate the apoptotic program. We have compared the kinetics of interaction of CrmA with five proteases that may play a role in apoptosis. Four of the proteases, all members of the caspase family, are inhibited with widely different rates and affinities ranging over 5 orders of magnitude. One is not inhibited at all under the experimental conditions. CrmA is quite selective in its ability to inhibit caspases, showing the highest affinity for interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme and the second highest for the caspase FLICE (Ki = 0.95 nM), identified as a component of the intracellular signaling complex recruited by ligation of the death receptor Fas. On the basis of comparative inhibitor kinetics, we propose that CrmA is unlikely to inhibit the caspases Yama, Mch2, or LAP3 in vivo but that its inhibition of FLICE is of a magnitude for this protease to be a key target of CrmA during Fas-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that FLICE catalyzes a crucial step in the promotion of cell death."
14581561,Borna disease virus phosphoprotein represses p53-mediated transcriptional activity by interference with HMGB1.,"Borna disease virus (BDV) is a noncytolytic, neurotropic RNA virus that has a broad host range in warm-blooded animals, probably including humans. Recently, it was demonstrated that a 24-kDa phosphoprotein (P) of BDV directly binds to a multifunctional protein, amphoterin-HMGB1, and inhibits its function in cultured neural cells (W. Kamitani, Y. Shoya, T. Kobayashi, M. Watanabe, B. J. Lee, G. Zhang, K. Tomonaga, and K. Ikuta, J. Virol. 75:8742-8751, 2001). This observation suggested that expression of BDV P may cause deleterious effects in cellular functions by interference with HMGB1. In this study, we further investigated the significance of the binding between P and HMGB1. We demonstrated that P directly binds to the A-box domain on HMGB1, which is also responsible for interaction with a tumor suppression factor, p53. Recent works have demonstrated that binding between HMGB1 and p53 enhances p53-mediated transcriptional activity. Thus, we examined whether BDV P affects the transcriptional activity of p53 by interference with HMGB1. Mammalian two-hybrid analysis revealed that p53 and P competitively interfere with the binding of each protein to HMGB1 in a p53-deficient cell line, NCI-H1299. In addition, P was able to significantly decrease p53-mediated transcriptional activation of the cyclin G promoter. Furthermore, we showed that activation of p21(waf1) expression was repressed in cyclosporine-treated BDV-infected cells, as well as p53-transduced NCI-H1299 cells. These results suggested that BDV P may be a unique inhibitor of p53 activity via binding to HMGB1."
16571828,Formation of nsP3-specific protein complexes during Sindbis virus replication.,"Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that include a number of important human and animal pathogens. Their replication proceeds in the cytoplasm of infected cells and does not directly depend on nuclei. Alphaviruses encode only four nonstructural proteins that are required for the replication of viral genome and transcription of the subgenomic RNA. However, the replicative enzyme complexes (RCs) appear to include cellular proteins and assemble on cellular organelles. We have developed a set of recombinant Sindbis (SIN) viruses with green fluorescent protein (GFP) insertions in one of the nonstructural proteins, nsP3, to further understand the RCs' genesis and structure. We studied the assembly of nsP3/GFP-containing protein complexes at different stages of infection and isolated a combination of cellular proteins that are associated with SIN nsP3. We demonstrated the following. (i) SIN nsP3 can tolerate the insertion of GFP into different fragments of the coding sequence; the designed recombinant viruses are viable, and their replication leads to the assembly of nsP3/GFP chimeric proteins into gradually developing, higher-order structures differently organized at early and late times postinfection. (ii) At late times postinfection, nsP3 is assembled into complexes of similar sizes, which appear to be bound to cytoskeleton filaments and can aggregate into larger structures. (iii) Protein complexes that are associated with nsP3/GFP contain a high concentration of cytoskeleton proteins, chaperones, elongation factor 1A, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, 14-3-3 proteins, and some of the ribosomal proteins. These proteins are proposed to be essential for SIN RC formation and/or functioning."
16895903,Tracking and elucidating alphavirus-host protein interactions.,"Viral infections cause profound alterations in host cells. Here, we explore the interactions between proteins of the Alphavirus Sindbis and host factors during the course of mammalian cell infection. Using a mutant virus expressing the viral nsP3 protein tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) we directly observed nsP3 localization and isolated nsP3-interacting proteins at various times after infection. These results revealed that host factor recruitment to nsP3-containing complexes was time dependent, with a specific early and persistent recruitment of G3BP and a later recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins. Expression of GFP-tagged G3BP allowed reciprocal isolation of nsP3 in Sindbis infected cells, as well as the identification of novel G3BP-interacting proteins in both uninfected and infected cells. Note-worthy interactions include nuclear pore complex components whose interactions with G3BP were reduced upon Sindbis infection. This suggests that G3BP is a nuclear transport factor, as hypothesized previously, and that viral infection may alter RNA transport. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that a portion of Sindbis nsP3 is localized at the nuclear envelope, suggesting a possible site of G3BP recruitment to nsP3-containing complexes. Our results demonstrate the utility of using a standard GFP tag to both track viral protein localization and elucidate specific viral-host interactions over time in infected mammalian cells."
20392851,Host factors associated with the Sindbis virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: role for G3BP1 and G3BP2 in virus replication.,"Sindbis virus (SINV) is the prototype member of the Alphavirus genus, whose members cause severe human diseases for which there is no specific treatment. To ascertain host factors important in the replication of the SINV RNA genome, we generated a SINV expressing nsP4, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, with an in-frame 3xFlag epitope tag. Proteomic analysis of nsP4-containing complexes isolated from cells infected with the tagged virus revealed 29 associated host proteins. Of these, 10 proteins were associated only at a later time of infection (12 h), 14 were associated both early and late, and five were isolated only at the earlier time (6 h postinfection). These results demonstrate the dynamic nature of the virus-host interaction that occurs over the course of infection and suggest that different host proteins may be required for the multiple functions carried out by nsP4. Two related proteins found in association with nsP4 at both times of infection, GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain) binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and G3BP2 were also previously identified as associated with SINV nsP2 and nsP3. We demonstrate a likely overlapping role for these host factors in limiting SINV replication events. The present study also identifies 10 host factors associated with nsP4 6 h after infection that were not found to be associated with nsP2 or nsP3. These factors are candidates for playing important roles in the RNA replication process. Identifying host factors essential for replication should lead to new strategies to interrupt alphavirus replication."
17329335,Development of Sindbis viruses encoding nsP2/GFP chimeric proteins and their application for studying nsP2 functioning.,"Sindbis virus (SINV) is one of almost 30 currently known alphaviruses. In infected cells, it produces only a few proteins that function in virus replication and interfere with the development of the antiviral response. One of the viral nonstructural proteins, nsP2, not only exhibits protease and RNA helicase activities that are directly involved in viral RNA replication but also plays critical roles in the development of transcriptional and translational shutoffs in the SINV-infected cells. These multiple activities of nsP2 complicate investigations of this protein's functions and further understanding of its structure. Using a transposon-based approach, we generated a cDNA library of SINV genomes with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene randomly inserted into nsP2 and identified a number of sites that can be used for GFP cloning without a strong effect on virus replication. Recombinant SIN viruses encoding nsP2/GFP chimeric protein were capable of growth in tissue culture and interfering with cellular functions. SINV, expressing GFP in the nsP2, was used to isolate nsP2-specific protein complexes formed in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. These complexes contained viral nsPs, all of the cellular proteins that we previously coisolated with SINV nsP3, and some additional protein factors that were not found before in detectable concentrations. The random insertion library-based approach, followed by the selection of the viable variants expressing heterologous proteins, can be applied for mapping the domain structure of the viral nonstructural and structural proteins, cloning of peptide tags for isolation of the protein-specific complexes, and studying their formation by using live-cell imaging. This approach may also be applicable to presentation of additional antigens and retargeting of viruses to new receptors."
19451633,Proteomic screening of variola virus reveals a unique NF-kappaB inhibitor that is highly conserved among pathogenic orthopoxviruses.,"Identification of the binary interactions between viral and host proteins has become a valuable tool for investigating viral tropism and pathogenesis. Here, we present the first systematic protein interaction screening of the unique variola virus proteome by using yeast 2-hybrid screening against a variety of human cDNA libraries. Several protein-protein interactions were identified, including an interaction between variola G1R, an ankryin/F-box containing protein, and human nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NF-kappaB1)/p105. This represents the first direct interaction between a pathogen-encoded protein and NF-kappaB1/p105. Orthologs of G1R are present in a variety of pathogenic orthopoxviruses, but not in vaccinia virus, and expression of any one of these viral proteins blocks NF-kappaB signaling in human cells. Thus, proteomic screening of variola virus has the potential to uncover modulators of the human innate antiviral responses."
11507205,PA subunit from influenza virus polymerase complex interacts with a cellular protein with homology to a family of transcriptional activators.,"The PA subunit of the influenza virus polymerase complex is a phosphoprotein that induces proteolytic degradation of coexpressed proteins. Point mutants with reduced proteolysis induction reconstitute viral ribonucleoproteins defective in replication but not in transcriptional activity. To look for cellular factors that could associate with PA protein, we have carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen. Using a human kidney cDNA library, we identified two different interacting clones. One of them was identified as the human homologue of a previously described cDNA clone from Gallus gallus called CLE. The human gene encodes a protein of 36 kDa (hCLE) and is expressed ubiquitously in all human organs tested. The interaction of PA and hCLE was also observed with purified proteins in vitro by using pull-down and pep-spot experiments. Mapping of the interaction showed that hCLE interacts with PA subunit at two regions (positions 493 to 512 and 557 to 574) in the PA protein sequence. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the hCLE protein localizes in both the nucleus and the cytosol, although with a predominantly cytosolic distribution. hCLE was found associated with active, highly purified virus ribonucleoproteins reconstituted in vivo from cloned cDNAs, suggesting that PA-hCLE interaction is functionally relevant. Searches in the databases showed that hCLE has 38% sequence homology to the central region of the yeast factor Cdc68, which modulates transcription by interaction with transactivators. Similar homologies were found with the other members of the Cdc68 homologue family of transcriptional activators, including the human FACT protein."
16254375,Rabies virus P protein interacts with STAT1 and inhibits interferon signal transduction pathways.,"Rabies virus P protein is a cofactor of RNA polymerase. We investigated other potential roles of P (CVS strain) by searching for cellular partners using two-hybrid screening. We isolated a cDNA encoding the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) that is a critical component of interferon type I (IFN-alpha/beta) and type II (IFN-gamma) signaling. We confirmed this interaction by glutathione S-transferase-pull-down assay. Deletion mutant analysis indicated that the carboxy-terminal part of P interacted with a region containing the DNA-binding domain and the coiled-coil domain of STAT1. The expression of P protein inhibits IFN-alpha- and IFN-gamma-induced transcriptional responses, thus impairing the IFN-induced antiviral state. Mechanistic studies indicate that P protein does not induce STAT1 degradation and does not interfere with STAT1 phosphorylation but prevents IFN-induced STAT1 nuclear accumulation. These results indicate that rabies P protein overcomes the antiviral response of the infected cells."
17686504,Measles virus V protein blocks Jak1-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 to escape IFN-alpha/beta signaling.,"Viruses have evolved various strategies to escape the antiviral activity of type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta). For measles virus, this function is carried by the polycistronic gene P that encodes, by an unusual editing strategy, for the phosphoprotein P and the virulence factor V (MV-V). MV-V prevents STAT1 nuclear translocation by either sequestration or phosphorylation inhibition, thereby blocking IFN-alpha/beta pathway. We show that both the N- and C-terminal domains of MV-V (PNT and VCT) contribute to the inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta signaling. Using the two-hybrid system and co-affinity purification experiments, we identified STAT1 and Jak1 as interactors of MV-V and demonstrate that MV-V can block the direct phosphorylation of STAT1 by Jak1. A deleterious mutation within the PNT domain of MV-V (Y110H) impaired its ability to interact and block STAT1 phosphorylation. Thus, MV-V interacts with at least two components of IFN-alpha/beta receptor complex to block downstream signaling."
15047795,"Transactivator protein BICP0 of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) is blocked by prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which points to a mechanism for PGD2-mediated inhibition of BHV-1 replication.","The immediate-early protein, BICP0, of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) transactivates a variety of viral and cellular genes. In a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screening, we found that lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase, which catalyzes the production of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)), is a cellular target of BICP0. We observed that, during wild-type BHV-1 infection, PGD(2) levels were increased intracellularly and decreased in the medium. These effects were absent upon infection with recombinant BHV-1 expressing beta-galactosidase instead of BICP0 (A2G2). Transient-expression assays showed that BICP0 alone caused a significant increase in PGD(2) levels in the cell. PGD(2) repressed BHV-1 replication in cultured cells. Antiviral activities of prostaglandins have been documented long ago, but their mode of action remains to be clarified. Here we provide evidence that PGD(2) impairs the transactivation ability of BICP0 that is necessary for efficient virus replication."
15795247,The cellular protein daxx interacts with avian sarcoma virus integrase and viral DNA to repress viral transcription.,"The cellular protein Daxx was identified as an interactor with avian sarcoma virus (ASV) integrase (IN) in a yeast two-hybrid screen. After infection, Daxx-IN interactions were detected by coimmunoprecipitation. An association between Daxx and viral DNA, likely mediated by IN, was also detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Daxx was not required for early events in ASV replication, including integration, as Daxx-null cells were transduced as efficiently as Daxx-expressing cells. However, viral reporter gene expression from ASV-based vectors was substantially higher in the Daxx-null cells than in Daxx-complemented cells. Consistent with this observation, histone deacetylases (HDACs) were found to associate with viral DNA in Daxx-complemented cells but not in Daxx-null cells. Furthermore, Daxx protein was induced in an interferon-like manner upon ASV infection. We conclude that Daxx interacts with an IN-viral DNA complex early after infection and may mediate the repression of viral gene expression via the recruitment of HDACs. Our findings provide a novel example of cellular immunity against viral replication in which viral transcription is repressed via the recruitment of antiviral proteins to the viral DNA."
18343476,Walleye dermal sarcoma virus Orf B functions through receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1) and protein kinase C.,"Walleye dermal sarcoma virus is a complex retrovirus that is associated with walleye dermal sarcomas that are seasonal in nature. Fall developing tumors contain low levels of spliced accessory gene transcripts A and B, suggesting a role for the encoded proteins, Orf A and Orf B, in oncogenesis. In explanted tumor cells the 35 kDa Orf B accessory protein is localized to the cell periphery in structures similar to focal adhesions and along actin stress fibers. Similar localization was observed in mammalian cells. The cellular protein, receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), bound Orf B in yeast two-hybrid assays and in cell culture. Sequence analysis of walleye RACK1 demonstrated high conservation to other known RACK1 sequences. RACK1 binds to activated protein kinase C (PKC). Orf B associates with PKCalpha, which is constitutively activated and localized at the membrane. Activated PKC promoted cell survival, proliferation, and increased cell viability in Orf B-expressing cells."
10846093,Expression of human herpesvirus 6B rep within infected cells and binding of its gene product to the TATA-binding protein in vitro and in vivo.,"We have characterized the human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) rep gene, which is a homologue of the adeno-associated virus type 2 rep and is unique in the herpesvirus family. Three transcripts, 9.0, 5.0, and 2. 7 kb (the major transcript), were detected by Northern blotting using an HHV-6B rep probe under late conditions. We investigated the expression kinetics of the rep gene using cycloheximide (CHX) and phosphonoformic acid (PFA), which are inhibitors of protein synthesis and viral DNA synthesis, respectively. The 5.2-kb transcript was mainly detected in the absence of protein biosynthesis upon infection, and none of the 9.0-, 5.0-, and 2.7-kb transcripts detected under the late conditions were detected in the presence of CHX and PFA. Sequences obtained from a cDNA library showed that the 5.0- and 2.7-kb transcripts were spliced from two and three exons, respectively, and the 2.7-kb transcript was more abundant. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody raised against the HHV-6 rep gene product (REP) revealed that REP was mainly present in the nucleus of MT-4 cells within 24 h after infection with HHV-6B. Using pull-down assays, coimmunoprecipitation, and a mammalian two hybrid system, we showed that HHV-6 REP binds to a transcription factor, human TATA-binding protein, through its N-terminal region."
12438593,Association of mumps virus V protein with RACK1 results in dissociation of STAT-1 from the alpha interferon receptor complex.,"It has been reported that mumps virus protein V or the C-terminal Cys-rich region of protein V (Vsp) is associated with blocking of the interferon (IFN) signal transduction pathway through a decrease in STAT-1 production. The intracellular target of the V protein was investigated by using a two-hybrid screening system with Vsp as bait. Full-length V protein and Vsp were able to bind to RACK1, and the interaction did not require two WD domains, WD1 and WD2, in RACK1. A significant interaction between V protein and RACK1 was also demonstrated in cells persistently infected with mumps virus (FLMT cells), and the formation of the complex was not affected by treatment with IFN. On the other hand, in uninfected cells, STAT-1 was associated with the long form of the beta subunit of the alpha IFN receptor, and this association was mediated by the function of RACK1 as an adaptor protein. Immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments revealed that the association of RACK1 or mumps virus V protein with the IFN receptor was undetectable in mumps virus-infected cells. Furthermore, RACK1 interacted with mumps virus V protein with a higher affinity than STAT-1 did. Therefore, it is suggested that mumps virus V protein has the ability to interact strongly with RACK1 and consequently to bring about the disruption of the complex formed from STAT-1, RACK1, and the IFN receptor."
17265167,The type 2 dengue virus envelope protein interacts with small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1) conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9).,"Dengue viruses are mosquito-borne flaviviruses and may cause the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Its envelope protein is responsible mainly for the virus attachment and entry to host cells. To identify the human cellular proteins interacting with the envelope protein of dengue virus serotype 2 inside host cells, we have performed a screening with the yeast-two-hybrid-based ""Functional Yeast Array"". Interestingly, the small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 conjugating enzyme 9 protein, modulating cellular processes such as those regulating signal transduction and cell growth, was one of the candidates interacting with the dengue virus envelope protein. With co-precipitation assay, we have demonstrated that it indeed could interact directly with the Ubc9 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis has demonstrated that Ubc9 might interact with the E protein via amino acid residues K51 and K241. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy has shown that the DV2E-EGFP proteins tended to progress toward the nuclear membrane and co-localized with Flag-Ubc9 proteins around the nuclear membrane in the cytoplasmic side, and DV2E-EGFP also shifted the distribution of Flag-Ubc9 from evenly in the nucleus toward concentrating around the nuclear membrane in the nucleic side. In addition, over-expression of Ubc9 could reduce the plaque formation of the dengue virus in mammalian cells. This is the first report that DV envelope proteins can interact with the protein of sumoylation system and Ubc9 may involve in the host defense system to prevent virus propagation."
15994787,AIP1/Alix is a binding partner of Sendai virus C protein and facilitates virus budding.,"The C protein, an accessory protein of Sendai virus (SeV), has anti-interferon capacity and suppresses viral RNA synthesis. In addition, it is thought that the C protein is involved in virus budding because of the low efficiency of release of progeny virions from C-knockout virus-infected cells and because of the requirement of the C protein for efficient release of virus-like particles. Here, we identified AIP1/Alix, a host protein involved in apoptosis and endosomal membrane trafficking, as an interacting partner of the C protein using a yeast two-hybrid system. The amino terminus of AIP1/Alix and the carboxyl terminus of the C protein are important for the interaction in mammalian cells. Mutant C proteins unable to bind AIP1/Alix failed to accelerate the release of virus-like particles from cells. Furthermore, overexpression of AIP1/Alix enhanced SeV budding from infected cells in a C-protein-dependent manner, while the release of nucleocapsid-free empty virions was also enhanced. Finally, AIP1/Alix depletion by small interfering RNA resulted in suppression of SeV budding. The results of this study suggest that AIP1/Alix plays a role in efficient SeV budding and that the SeV C protein facilitates virus budding through interaction with AIP1/Alix."
19066626,The host-dependent interaction of alpha-importins with influenza PB2 polymerase subunit is required for virus RNA replication.,"The influenza virus polymerase is formed by the PB1, PB2 and PA subunits and is required for virus transcription and replication in the nucleus of infected cells. As PB2 is a relevant host-range determinant we expressed a TAP-tagged PB2 in human cells and isolated intracellular complexes. Alpha-importin was identified as a PB2-associated factor by proteomic analyses. To study the relevance of this interaction for virus replication we mutated the PB2 NLS and analysed the phenotype of mutant subunits, polymerase complexes and RNPs. While mutant PB2 proteins showed reduced nuclear accumulation, they formed polymerase complexes normally when co expressed with PB1 and PA. However, mutant RNPs generated with a viral CAT replicon showed up to hundred-fold reduced CAT accumulation. Rescue of nuclear localisation of mutant PB2 by insertion of an additional SV40 TAg-derived NLS did not revert the mutant phenotype of RNPs. Furthermore, determination of recombinant RNP accumulation in vivo indicated that PB2 NLS mutations drastically reduced virus RNA replication. These results indicate that, above and beyond its role in nuclear accumulation, PB2 interaction with alpha-importins is required for virus RNA replication. To ascertain whether PB2-alpha-importin binding could contribute to the adaptation of H5N1 avian viruses to man, their association in vivo was determined. Human alpha importin isoforms associated efficiently to PB2 protein of an H3N2 human virus but bound to diminished and variable extents to PB2 from H5N1 avian or human strains, suggesting that the function of alpha importin during RNA replication is important for the adaptation of avian viruses to the human host."
16501077,Inhibition of interferon signaling by rabies virus phosphoprotein P: activation-dependent binding of STAT1 and STAT2.,"Rabies virus (RV) phosphoprotein P is an interferon (IFN) antagonist counteracting transcriptional activation of type I IFN (K. Brzózka, S. Finke, and K. K. Conzelmann, J. Virol 79:7673-7681, 2005). We here show that RV P in addition is responsible for preventing IFN-alpha/beta- and IFN-gamma-stimulated JAK-STAT signaling in RV-infected cells by the retention of activated STATs in the cytoplasm. Expression of IFN-stimulated response element- and gamma-activated sequence-controlled genes was severely impaired in cells infected with RV SAD L16 or in cells expressing RV P protein from transfected plasmids. In contrast, a recombinant RV expressing small amounts of P had lost the ability to interfere with JAK-STAT signaling. IFN-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 was not impaired in RV P-expressing cells; rather, a defect in STAT recycling was suggested by distinct accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs in cell extracts. In the presence of P, activated STAT1 and STAT2 were unable to accumulate in the nucleus. Notably, STAT1 and STAT2 were coprecipitated with RV P only from extracts of cells previously stimulated with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, whereas in nonstimulated cells no association of P with STATs was observed. This conditional, IFN activation-dependent binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs by RV P is unique for a viral IFN antagonist. The 10 C-terminal residues of P are required for counteracting JAK-STAT signaling but not for inhibition of transcriptional activation of IFN-beta, thus demonstrating two independent functions of RV P in counteracting the host's IFN response."
18231581,Coronavirus spike protein inhibits host cell translation by interaction with eIF3f.,"In response to viral infection, the expression of numerous host genes, including predominantly a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, is usually up-regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels. It was noted that in cells infected with coronavirus, transcription and translation of some of these genes were differentially induced. Drastic induction of their expression at the transcriptional level was observed in cells infected with coronavirus. However, induction of the same genes at the translational level was usually found to be minimal to moderate. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using SARS-CoV proteins as baits, revealing that a subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), eIF3f, may interact with the N-terminal region of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. Meanwhile, parallel experiments confirmed that eIF3f could also interact with the S protein of another coronavirus, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). These interactions led to the inhibition of translation of a reporter gene in both in vitro expression system and intact cells. Interestingly, IBV-infected cells stably expressing a Flag-tagged eIF3f showed much higher translation of IL-6 and IL-8, suggesting that the interaction between coronavirus S protein and eIF3f plays a functional role in controlling the expression of host genes, especially genes that are induced during coronavirus infection cycles. This study reveals a novel mechanism exploited by coronavirus to regulate viral pathogenesis."
17959666,Yaba monkey tumor virus encodes a functional inhibitor of interleukin-18.,"Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a critical proinflammatory cytokine whose extracellular bioactivity is regulated by a cellular IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). Many poxviruses have acquired variants of this IL-18BP gene, some of which have been shown to act as viral virulence factors. Yaba monkey tumor virus (YMTV) encodes a related family member, 14L, which is similar to the orthopoxvirus IL-18BPs. YMTV 14L was expressed from a baculovirus system and tested for its ability to bind and inhibit IL-18. We found that YMTV 14L bound both human IL-18 (hIL-18) and murine IL-18 with high affinity, at 4.1 nM and 6.5 nM, respectively. YMTV 14L was able to fully sequester hIL-18 but could only partially inhibit the biological activity of hIL-18 as measured by gamma interferon secretion from KG-1 cells. Additionally, 17 hIL-18 point mutants were tested by surface plasmon resonance for their ability to bind to YMTV 14L. Two clusters of hIL-18 surface residues were found to be important for the hIL-18-YMTV 14L interaction, in contrast to results for the Variola virus IL-18BP, which has been shown to primarily interact with a single cluster of three amino acids. The altered binding specificity of YMTV 14L most likely represents an adaptation resulting in increased fitness of the virus and affirms the plasticity of poxviral inhibitor domains that target cytokines like IL-18."
9420283,An arenavirus RING (zinc-binding) protein binds the oncoprotein promyelocyte leukemia protein (PML) and relocates PML nuclear bodies to the cytoplasm.,"The promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) forms nuclear bodies which are altered in some disease conditions. We report that the cytoplasmic RNA virus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) influences the distribution of PML bodies. In cells infected with LCMV, the Z protein and PML form large bodies primarily in the cytoplasm. Transient transfection studies indicate that Z alone is sufficient to redistribute PML to the cytoplasm and that PML and Z colocalize. Coimmunoprecipitation studies show specific interaction between PML and Z proteins. A similar result was observed with a Z protein from another arenavirus, Lassa virus, suggesting that this is a general feature of the Arenaviridae. Genetically engineered mutations in PML were used to show that the Z protein binds the N-terminal region of PML and does not need the PML RING or the nuclear localization signal to colocalize. The Z protein acts dominantly to overcome the diffuse phenotype observed in several PML mutants. The interaction between PML and Z may influence certain unique characteristics of arenavirus infection."
17767916,Influenza A virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) interacts with cellular multifunctional protein nucleolin during infection.,"Influenza A virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is the most important viral regulatory factor that controls cellular processes to facilitate viral replication. To gain further insight into the role of NS1, we tried to find novel cellular factors that interact with NS1. The complexes of NS1 and target proteins were pulled down from an infected cell lysate using anti-NS1 (A/Udorn/72) single-chain Fv and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting analysis. We identified nucleolin, a multifunctional major nucleolar protein, as a novel NS1-binding protein. The RNA-binding domain of NS1 was responsible for this binding, as judged by a GST (glutathione S-transferase) pull-down assay with the GST-fused functional domains of NS1. By laser confocal microscopy, we observed the co-localization of NS1 with nucleolin most clearly in the nucleoli, indicating that NS1 is interacting with nucleolin during infection. Our results suggest a novel function of NS1, namely, affecting cellular events via interaction with nucleolin."
15045564,Rubella virus P90 associates with the cytokinesis regulatory protein Citron-K kinase and the viral infection and constitutive expression of P90 protein both induce cell cycle arrest following S phase in cell culture.,"In utero infection of developing fetus by Rubella virus (RV) causes cell division inhibition of critical precursor cells in organogenesis, CNS-associated birth defects and induction of apoptosis in cell culture. The underlying mechanisms of RV-induced congenital abnormalities are not known. Here, we identified a novel interaction between RV replicase P90 protein and a cytokinesis-regulatory protein, the Citron-K kinase (CK), in a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screen. Aberrations in cytokinesis and subsequent apoptosis do occur in specific cell types when the CK gene is knocked out or, its regulatory function is perturbed. Our analysis found that full-length P90 binds CK and in RV-infected cells P90 colocalizes with CK in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, during RV infection as well as cellular expression of P90 alone, we identified a discrete subpopulation of cells containing 4N DNA content, indicating that these cells are arrested in the cell cycle following S phase, suggesting that cellular expression of viral P90 during RV infection perturbs cytokinesis. Previous reports by others established that RV infection leads to apoptosis in cell culture. These observations together taken to the fetal organogenesis level, favor the idea that RV P90, by binding to cellular CK, invokes cell cycle aberrations resulting in the cell- and organ-specific growth inhibition and programmed cell death during RV infection in utero, which commonly is referred to as RV-induced teratogenesis."
10708444,The T-cell receptor zeta chain contains two homologous domains with which simian immunodeficiency virus Nef interacts and mediates down-modulation.,"We have recently demonstrated that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Nef binds to the zeta chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR), leading to its down-modulation from T-cell surfaces (I. Bell, C. Ashman, J. Maughan, E. Hooker, F. Cook, and T. A. Reinhart, J. Gen. Virol. 79:2717-2727, 1998). Using a panel of human as well as rhesus macaque TCR zeta cytoplasmic domain mutants, we have identified in this report two linear peptides in the cytoplasmic domain of TCR zeta which independently interact with SIV Nef. Each SIV Nef interaction domain was sufficient in the absence of the other for interaction with SIV Nef in a yeast two-hybrid assay. In parallel, we demonstrated that Nef down-modulation of CD8-TCR zeta fusion proteins containing full-length or truncated portions of the TCR zeta cytoplasmic domain occurs in transiently transfected 293T cells. Furthermore, using proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, a glutathione S-transferase-Nef fusion protein coprecipitated histidine-tagged portions of the TCR zeta cytoplasmic domain which contained SNID-1 or SNID-2. The peptides targeted by SIV Nef, YNELNL and YSEIGMKGERRR, are portions of the first and second of three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs which are important in signal transduction, thymocyte development, and TCR biogenesis. These results demonstrate that SIV Nef binds to two distinct domains on TCR zeta in the absence of other T-cell-specific factors, and that interaction with either domain is sufficient to cause down-modulation of TCR zeta."
10603321,The nucleocapsid protein of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus interacts with the cellular heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 in vitro and in vivo.,"The nucleocapsid (N) protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and the cellular heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP-A1) are RNA-binding proteins, binding to the leader RNA and the intergenic sequence of MHV negative-strand template RNAs, respectively. Previous studies have suggested a role for both N and hnRNP-A1 proteins in MHV RNA synthesis. However, it is not known whether the two proteins can interact with each other. Here we employed a series of methods to determine their interactions both in vitro and in vivo. Both N and hnRNP-A1 genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and their interactions were determined with a GST-binding assay. Results showed that N protein directly and specifically interacted with hnRNP-A1 in vitro. To dissect the protein-binding domain on the N protein, 15 deletion constructs were made by PCR and expressed as GST fusion proteins. Two hnRNP-A1-binding sites were identified on N protein: site A is located at amino acids 1 to 292 and site B at amino acids 392 to 455. In addition, we found that N protein interacted with itself and that the self-interacting domain coincided with site A but not with site B. Using a fluorescence double-staining technique, we showed that N protein colocalized with hnRNP-A1 in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region, of MHV-infected cells, where viral RNA replication/transcription occurs. The N protein and hnRNP-A1 were coimmunoprecipitated from the lysates of MHV-infected cells either by an N- or by an hnRNP-A1-specific monoclonal antibody, indicating a physical interaction between N and hnRNP-A1 proteins. Furthermore, using the yeast two-hybrid system, we showed that N protein interacted with hnRNP-A1 in vivo. These results thus establish that MHV N protein interacts with hnRNP-A1 both in vitro and in vivo."
16973571,Interaction of Bunyamwera Orthobunyavirus NSs protein with mediator protein MED8: a mechanism for inhibiting the interferon response.,"The NSs protein of Bunyamwera virus (Bunyaviridae) is an antiapoptotic interferon antagonist involved in silencing host protein expression by interfering with mRNA synthesis. Here, we show that the ability to inhibit both host transcription and the interferon response is linked to interaction of NSs with the MED8 component of Mediator, a protein complex necessary for mRNA production. The interacting domain on NSs was mapped to the C-terminal region, which contains amino acids conserved among orthobunyavirus NSs proteins. A recombinant virus in which the interacting domain in NSs was deleted had strongly reduced ability to inhibit host protein expression and was unable to inhibit the interferon response. This study provides further information on the mechanisms by which bunyavirus nonstructural proteins are involved in pathogenesis."
18579593,STAT2 is a primary target for measles virus V protein-mediated alpha/beta interferon signaling inhibition.,"Measles virus, a member of the Morbillivirus family, infects millions of people each year despite the availability of effective vaccines. The V protein of measles virus is an important virulence factor that can interfere with host innate immunity by inactivating alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) and IFN-gamma signaling through protein interactions with signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins STAT1 and STAT2. Here we demonstrate that although STAT1 interference results from protein interactions within a V protein N-terminal region encompassed by amino acids 110 to 130, detection of STAT1 interaction and IFN-gamma signaling inhibition requires the presence of cellular STAT2. Cell-specific variability in STAT1 interference was observed to correlate with V protein expression level. A more direct target for measles virus V protein-mediated IFN-alpha/beta evasion is STAT2. Results indicate that the widely conserved C-terminal zinc finger domain of measles virus V protein is both necessary and sufficient to bind STAT2 and disrupt IFN-alpha/beta signal transduction. Mutagenesis and molecular modeling define a contact surface for STAT2 association that includes aspartic acid residue 248 as critical for STAT2 interference and IFN antiviral immune suppression. These findings clearly define the molecular determinants for measles virus IFN evasion and validate specific targets as candidates for therapeutic intervention."
15047845,Human MxA protein inhibits the replication of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus.,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) belongs to the genus Nairovirus within the family Bunyaviridae and is the causative agent of severe hemorrhagic fever. Despite increasing knowledge about hemorrhagic fever viruses, the factors determining their pathogenicity are still poorly understood. The interferon-induced MxA protein has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on several members of the Bunyaviridae family, but the effect of MxA against CCHFV has not previously been studied. Here, we report that human MxA has antiviral activity against CCHFV. The yield of progeny virus in cells constitutively expressing MxA was reduced up to 1,000-fold compared with control cells, and accumulation of viral genomes was blocked. Confocal microscopy revealed that MxA colocalizes with the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of CCHFV in the perinuclear regions of infected cells. Furthermore, we found that MxA interacted with NP by using a coimmunoprecipitation assay. We also found that an amino acid substitution (E645R) within the C-terminal domain of MxA resulted in a loss of MxA antiviral activity and, concomitantly, in the capacity to interact with CCHFV NP. These results suggest that MxA, by interacting with a component of the nucleocapsid, prevents replication of CCHFV viral RNA and thereby inhibits the production of new infectious virus particles."
8892871,Nonstructural proteins NS2 of minute virus of mice associate in vivo with 14-3-3 protein family members.,"The nonstructural NS2 proteins of the prototype strain of minute virus of mice (MVMp) were previously shown to be involved in parvoviral DNA amplification as well as in efficient virus production in a host cell-specific manner (L. K. Naeger, N. Salomé, and D. J. Pintel, J. Virol. 67:1034-1043, 1993). NS2 polypeptides were also reported to participate in the cytotoxic activity of parvoviruses (C. Legrand, J. Rommelaere, and P. Caillet-Fauquet, Virology 195:149-155, 1993), for which transformed cells are preferential targets. To identify cellular partners of NS2 proteins, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed with various antibodies directed against the parvoviral products. Two cellular proteins with molecular masses of 30 and 32 kDa were found to associate in vivo with the NS2 polypeptides. From amino acid sequence homology, these NS2 partners were assigned to the 14-3-3 family of cellular proteins, showing at least partial identity with the epsilon and beta or zeta 14-3-3 isoforms. In agreement with this assignment, NS2-30/32-kDa protein immune complexes displayed an activating function for exoenzyme S in vitro, a hallmark of 14-3-3 polypeptides. Interactions with 14-3-3 proteins did not appear sufficient for NS2 functions, since they were not disrupted by NS2 C-terminal modifications that impaired virus replication. Binding of NS2 to 14-3-3 proteins was detected in various cells of mouse, rat, hamster, monkey, and human origin, irrespective of NS2 dispensability and host cell transformation or permissiveness. The ubiquitous 14-3-3 proteins were recently reported to associate with several other cellular or viral polypeptides involved in signal transduction and/or cell cycle regulation pathways (A. Aitken, Trends Biochem. Sci. 20:95-97, 1995). The NS2 products may connect with one of these pathways through their interaction with specific 14-3-3 polypeptides."
10400732,Myxoma virus Serp2 is a weak inhibitor of granzyme B and interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme in vitro and unlike CrmA cannot block apoptosis in cowpox virus-infected cells.,"The Serp2 protein encoded by the leporipoxvirus myxoma virus is essential for full virulence (F. Messud-Petit, J. Gelfi, M. Delverdier, M. F. Amardeilh, R. Py, G. Sutter, and S. Bertagnoli, J. Virol. 72:7830-7839, 1998) and, like crmA of cowpox virus (CPV), is reported to inhibit the interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE, caspase-1) (F. Petit, S. Bertagnoli, J. Gelfi, F. Fassy, C. Boucraut-Baralon, and A. Milon, J. Virol. 70:5860-5866, 1996). Serp2 and CrmA both contain Asp at the P1 position within the serpin reactive site loop and yet are only 35% identical overall. Serp2 protein was cleaved by ICE but, unlike CrmA, did not form a stable complex with ICE that was detectable by native gel electrophoresis. Attempts to covalently cross-link ICE-serpin inhibitory complexes were successful with CrmA, but no complex between ICE and Serp2 was visible after cross-linking. Purified His10-tagged Serp2 protein was a relatively poor inhibitor of ICE, with a Ki of 80 nM compared to 4 pM for CrmA. Serp2 protein resembled CrmA in that a stable complex with the serine proteinase granzyme B was detectable after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, Serp2 was less effective at inhibiting granzyme B activity (Ki = 420 nM) than CrmA (Ki = 100 nM). Finally, Serp2 was tested for the ability to replace CrmA and inhibit apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells infected with a CPV recombinant deleted for CrmA but expressing Serp2. Unlike wild-type-CPV-infected cells, apoptosis was readily observed in cells infected with the recombinant virus, as indicated by the induction of both nuclear fragmentation and caspase-mediated cleavage of DEVD-AMC [acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-(amino-4-methyl coumarin)]. These results indicate that Serp2 is unable to functionally substitute for CrmA within the context of CPV and that the inhibition spectra for Serp2 and CrmA are distinct."
16840350,"A poxvirus host range protein, CP77, binds to a cellular protein, HMG20A, and regulates its dissociation from the vaccinia virus genome in CHO-K1 cells.","Vaccinia virus does not grow in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells in the absence of a viral host range factor, cowpox protein CP77. In this study, CP77 was fused to the C terminus of green fluorescence protein (GFP-CP77) and a series of nested deletion mutants of GFP-CP77 was constructed for insertion into a vaccinia virus host range mutant, VV-hr, and expressed from a viral early promoter. Deletion mapping analyses demonstrated that the N-terminal 352 amino acids of CP77 were sufficient to support vaccinia virus growth in CHO-K1 cells, whereas the C-terminal residues 353 to 668 were dispensable. In yeast two-hybrid analyses, CP77 bound to a cellular protein, HMG20A, and GST pulldown analyses showed that residues 1 to 234 of CP77 were sufficient for this interaction. After VV-hr virus infection of CHO-K1 cells, HMG20A was translocated from the nucleus to viral factories and bound to the viral genome via the HMG box region. In control VV-hr-infected CHO-K1 cells, binding of HMG20A to the viral genome persisted from 2 to 8 h postinfection (h p.i.); in contrast, when CP77 was expressed, the association of HMG20A with viral genome was transient, with little HMG20A remaining bound at 8 h p.i. This indicates that dissociation of HMG20A from viral factories correlates well with CP77 host range activity in CHO-K1 cells. Finally, in cells expressing a CP77 deletion protein (amino acids 277 to 668) or a DeltaANK5 mutant that did not support vaccinia virus growth and did not contain the HMG20A binding site, HMG20A remained bound to viral DNA, demonstrating that the binding of CP77 to HMG20A is essential for its host range function. In summary, our data revealed that a novel cellular protein, HMG20A, the dissociation of which from viral DNA is regulated by CP77, providing the first cellular target regulated by viral host range CP77 protein."
16537421,Infection of human cancer cells with myxoma virus requires Akt activation via interaction with a viral ankyrin-repeat host range factor.,"We demonstrate that the susceptibility of human cancer cells to be infected and killed by an oncolytic poxvirus, myxoma virus (MV), is related to the basal level of endogenous phosphorylated Akt. We further demonstrate that nonpermissive tumor cells will switch from resistant to susceptible for MV infection after expression of ectopically active Akt (Myr-Akt) and that permissive cancer cells can be rendered nonpermissive by blocking Akt activation with a dominant-negative inhibitor of Akt. Finally, the activation of Akt by MV involves the formation of a complex between the viral host range ankyrin-repeat protein, M-T5, and Akt. We conclude that the Akt pathway is a key restriction determinant for permissiveness of human cancer cells by MV."
12134008,Walleye dermal sarcoma virus cyclin interacts with components of the mediator complex and the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme.,"Walleye dermal sarcoma virus (WDSV) encodes an accessory protein, OrfA, with sequence homology to cyclins (retrovirus cyclin). In cells transfected with an expression construct, OrfA was localized to the nucleus and was concentrated in interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), sites where splicing factors are concentrated. Other proteins identified in IGCs include transcription factors, the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (cdk8). cdk8 is the kinase partner of cyclin C and a component of the mediator complex, associated with the Pol II holoenzyme. cdk8 and cyclin C can regulate transcription via phosphorylation of cyclin H and the carboxy-terminal domain of Pol II. OrfA in transfected HeLa cells was found to colocalize and copurify with hyperphosphorylated forms of Pol II (Pol IIO) in IGCs, and OrfA was coimmunoprecipitated from lysates of transfected cells with an antibody against Pol IIO. Likewise, Pol IIO could be coprecipitated with an antibody against OrfA. A survey with antibodies against several different cdks resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of OrfA with anti-cdk8, and antiserum against OrfA was able to coprecipitate cdk8 from lysates of cells that express OrfA. Coprecipitation of OrfA with anti-cyclin C demonstrated that it was included in complexes with OrfA and cdk8. OrfA has sequence and structural similarities to cyclin C, and, functionally, OrfA appears to have the capacity to both enhance and inhibit the activity of promoters in a cell-specific manner, similar to functions of the mediator complex. These data suggest that WDSV OrfA functions through its interactions with these large, transcription complexes. Further investigations will clarify the role of the retrovirus cyclin in control of virus expression and transformation."
16532031,The tax protein from the primate T-cell lymphotropic virus type 3 is expressed in vivo and is functionally related to HTLV-1 Tax rather than HTLV-2 Tax.,"Human T-cell leukemia virus and simian T-cell leukemia virus (STLV) form the primate T-cell lymphotropic viruses group. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 and type 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) encode the Tax viral transactivator (Tax1 and Tax2, respectively). Tax1 possesses an oncogenic potential and is responsible for cell transformation both in vivo and in vitro. We and others have recently discovered the existence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 3. However, there is currently no evidence for the presence of a Tax protein in HTLV-3-infected individuals. We show that the serum of an HTLV-3 asymptomatic carrier and the sera of two STLV-3-infected monkeys contain specific anti-Tax3 antibodies. We also show that tax3 mRNA is present in the PBMCs obtained from an STLV-3-infected monkey, demonstrating that Tax3 is expressed in vivo. We further demonstrate that Tax3 intracellular localization is very similar to that of Tax1 and that Tax3 binds to both CBP and p300 coactivators. Using purified Tax3, we show that the protein increases transcription from a 4TxRE G-free cassette plasmid in an in vitro transcription assay. In all cell types tested, including transiently transfected lymphocytes, Tax3 activates its own promoter STLV-3 long terminal repeat (LTR), which contains only two Tax Responsive Elements (TREs), and activates also HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 LTRs. In addition, Tax3 also activates the NF-kappaB pathway. We also show that Tax3 possesses a PDZ-binding sequence at its C-terminal end. Our results demonstrate that Tax3 is a transactivator, and that its properties are more similar to that of Tax1, rather than of Tax2. This suggests the possible occurrence of lymphoproliferative disorders among HTLV-3-infected populations."
11907205,Recognition of the measles virus nucleocapsid as a mechanism of IRF-3 activation.,"The mechanisms of cellular recognition for virus infection remain poorly understood despite the wealth of information regarding the signaling events and transcriptional responses that ensue. Host cells respond to viral infection through the activation of multiple signaling cascades, including the activation of NF-kappaB, c-Jun/ATF-2 (AP-1), and the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Although viral products such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the processes of viral binding and fusion have been implicated in the activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1, the mechanism(s) of IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7 activation has yet to be fully elucidated. Using recombinant measles virus (MeV) constructs, we now demonstrate that phosphorylation-dependent IRF-3 activation represents a novel cellular detection system that recognizes the MeV nucleocapsid structure. At low multiplicities of infection, IRF-3 activation is dependent on viral transcription, since UV cross-linking and a deficient MeV containing a truncated polymerase L gene failed to induce IRF-3 phosphorylation. Expression of the MeV nucleocapsid (N) protein, without the requirement for any additional viral proteins or the generation of dsRNA, was sufficient for IRF-3 activation. In addition, the nucleocapsid protein was found to associate with both IRF-3 and the IRF-3 virus-activated kinase, suggesting that it may aid in the colocalization of the kinase and the substrate. Altogether, this study suggests that IRF-3 recognizes nucleocapsid structures during the course of an MeV infection and triggers the induction of interferon production."
8034697,Inhibition of interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme by the cowpox virus serpin CrmA. An example of cross-class inhibition.,"We reported previously that human interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) is regulated by the CrmA serpin encoded by cowpox virus. We now report the mechanism and kinetics of this unusual inhibition of a cysteine proteinase by a member of the serpin superfamily previously thought to inhibit serine proteinase only. CrmA possesses several characteristics typical of a number of inhibitory serpins. It is conformationally unstable, unfolding around 3 M urea, and stable to denaturation in 8 M urea upon complex formation with ICE. CrmA rapidly inhibits ICE with an association rate constant (kon) of 1.7 x 10(7) M-1 s-1, forming a tight complex with an equilibrium constant for inhibition (Ki) of less than 4 x 10(-12) M. These data indicate that CrmA is a potent inhibitor of ICE, consistent with the dramatic effects of CrmA on modifying host responses to virus infection. The inhibition of ICE by CrmA is an example of a ""cross-class"" interaction, in which a serpin inhibits a non-serine proteinase. Since CrmA possesses characteristics shared by inhibitors of serine proteinases, we presume that ICE, though it is a cysteine proteinase, has a substrate binding geometry strikingly close to that of serine proteinases. We reason that it is the substrate binding geometry, not the catalytic mechanism of a proteinase, that dictates its reactivity with protein inhibitors."
17215279,The MyD116 African swine fever virus homologue interacts with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 and activates its phosphatase activity.,"The DP71L protein of African swine fever virus (ASFV) shares sequence similarity with the herpes simplex virus ICP34.5 protein over a C-terminal domain. We showed that the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) interacts specifically with the ASFV DP71L protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The chimeric full-length DP71L protein, from ASFV strain Badajoz 71 (BA71V), fused to glutathione S-transferase (DP71L-GST) was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to bind specifically to the PP1-alpha catalytic subunit expressed as a histidine fusion protein (6xHis-PP1alpha) in E. coli. The functional effects of this interaction were investigated by measuring the levels of PP1 and PP2A in ASFV-infected Vero cells. This showed that infection with wild-type ASFV strain BA71V activated PP1 between two- and threefold over that of mock-infected cells. This activation did not occur in cells infected with the BA71V isolate in which the DP71L gene had been deleted, suggesting that expression of DP71L leads to PP1 activation. In contrast, no effect was observed on the activity of PP2A following ASFV infection. We showed that infection of cells with wild-type BA71V virus resulted in decreased phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2alpha). ICP34.5 recruits PP1 to dephosphorylate the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2 (also known as eIF-2alpha); possibly the ASFV DP71L protein has a similar function."
17038183,Cyclophilin A interacts with diverse lentiviral capsids.,"The capsid (CA) protein of HIV-1 binds with high affinity to the host protein cyclophilin A (CypA). This binding positively affects some early stage of the viral life-cycle because prevention of binding either by drugs that occupy that active site of cyclophilin A, by mutation in HIV-1 CA, or RNAi that knocks down intracellular CypA level diminishes viral infectivity. The closely related lentivirus, SIVcpz also binds CypA, but it was thought that this interaction was limited to the HIV-1/SIVcpz lineage because other retroviruses failed to interact with CypA in a yeast two-hybrid assay."
15827195,Association of the influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with cellular RNA polymerase II.,"Transcription by the influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is dependent on cellular RNA processing activities that are known to be associated with cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription, namely, capping and splicing. Therefore, it had been hypothesized that transcription by the viral RNA polymerase and Pol II might be functionally linked. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the influenza virus RNA polymerase complex interacts with the large subunit of Pol II via its C-terminal domain. The viral polymerase binds hyperphosphorylated forms of Pol II, indicating that it targets actively transcribing Pol II. In addition, immunofluorescence analysis is consistent with a new model showing that influenza virus polymerase accumulates at Pol II transcription sites. The present findings provide a framework for further studies to elucidate the mechanistic principles of transcription by a viral RNA polymerase and have implications for the regulation of Pol II activities in infected cells."
25544563,Global mapping of herpesvirus-host protein complexes reveals a transcription strategy for late genes.,"Mapping host-pathogen interactions has proven instrumental for understanding how viruses manipulate host machinery and how numerous cellular processes are regulated. DNA viruses such as herpesviruses have relatively large coding capacity and thus can target an extensive network of cellular proteins. To identify the host proteins hijacked by this pathogen, we systematically affinity tagged and purified all 89 proteins of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) from human cells. Mass spectrometry of this material identified over 500 virus-host interactions. KSHV causes AIDS-associated cancers, and its interaction network is enriched for proteins linked to cancer and overlaps with proteins that are also targeted by HIV-1. We found that the conserved KSHV protein ORF24 binds to RNA polymerase II and brings it to viral late promoters by mimicking and replacing cellular TATA-box-binding protein (TBP). This is required for herpesviral late gene expression, a complex and poorly understood phase of the viral lifecycle."
25519916,The EHEC-host interactome reveals novel targets for the translocated intimin receptor.,"Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) manipulate their human host through at least 39 effector proteins which hijack host processes through direct protein-protein interactions (PPIs). To identify their protein targets in the host cells, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens, allowing us to find 48 high-confidence protein-protein interactions between 15 EHEC effectors and 47 human host proteins. In comparison to other bacteria and viruses we found that EHEC effectors bind more frequently to hub proteins as well as to proteins that participate in a higher number of protein complexes. The data set includes six new interactions that involve the translocated intimin receptor (TIR), namely HPCAL1, HPCAL4, NCALD, ARRB1, PDE6D, and STK16. We compared these TIR interactions in EHEC and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and found that five interactions were conserved. Notably, the conserved interactions included those of serine/threonine kinase 16 (STK16), hippocalcin-like 1 (HPCAL1) as well as neurocalcin-delta (NCALD). These proteins co-localize with the infection sites of EPEC. Furthermore, our results suggest putative functions of poorly characterized effectors (EspJ, EspY1). In particular, we observed that EspJ is connected to the microtubule system while EspY1 appears to be involved in apoptosis/cell cycle regulation."
15364941,Protein kinase C-related kinase 2 regulates hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase function by phosphorylation.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase required for replication of the HCV RNA genome. We have identified a peptide that most closely resembles a short region of the protein kinase C-related kinase 2 (PRK2) by screening of a random 12-mer peptide library displayed on the surface of the M13 bacteriophage with NS5B proteins immobilized on microwell plates. Competitive phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a synthetic peptide showed that the phage clone displaying this peptide could bind HCV RNA polymerase with a high affinity. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization studies demonstrated in vivo interaction of NS5B with PRK2. In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that PRK2 specifically phosphorylates NS5B by interaction with the N-terminal finger domain of NS5B (amino acids 1-187). Consistent with the in vitro NS5B-phosphorylating activity of PRK2, we detected the phosphorylated form of NS5B by metabolic cell labeling. Furthermore, HCV NS5B immunoprecipitated from HCV subgenomic replicon cells was specifically recognized by an antiphosphoserine antibody. Knock-down of the endogenous PRK2 expression using a PRK2-specific small interfering RNA inhibited HCV RNA replication. In contrast, PRK2 overexpression, which was accompanied by an increase of in the level of its active form, dramatically enhanced HCV RNA replication. Altogether, our results indicate that HCV RNA replication is regulated by NS5B phosphorylation by PRK2."
15846844,Proteomic profiling of cellular proteins interacting with the hepatitis C virus core protein.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a causative agent of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The core protein of HCV packages the viral RNA genome to form a nucleocapsid. In addition to its function as a structural protein, core protein is involved in regulation of cellular transcription, virus-induced transformation, and pathogenesis. To gain insights into cellular functions of the core protein by identification of cellular proteins interacting with the core protein, we employed a proteomic approach. Hepatocytes soluble cytoplasmic proteins were applied to the core proteins immobilized on Ni-nitrilotriacetic resin and total bound cellular proteins were resolved by 2-DE. Analyses of interacting proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry allowed identification of 14 cellular proteins binding to the core protein. These proteins include DEAD-box polypeptide 5, similar in function to a known protein identified previously by yeast two-hybrid screening and 13 newly identified cellular proteins. Interestingly, nine protein spots were identified as intermediate microfilament proteins, including cytokeratins (five spots for cytokeratin 8, two for cytokeratin 19, and one for cytokeratin 18) and vimentin. Cytokeratin 8 and vimentin, which were previously shown to be involved in the infection processes of other viruses, were further analyzed to confirm their in vivo interactions with the core protein by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. We discuss the functional implications of the interactions of the core protein with newly identified cellular proteins in HCV infection and pathogenesis."
25244949,Hepatitis C virus core protein suppresses mitophagy by interacting with parkin in the context of mitochondrial depolarization.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes mitochondrial injury and oxidative stress, and impaired mitochondria are selectively eliminated through autophagy-dependent degradation (mitophagy). We investigated whether HCV affects mitophagy in terms of mitochondrial quality control. The effect of HCV on mitophagy was examined using HCV-Japanese fulminant hepatitis-1-infected cells and the uncoupling reagent carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone as a mitophagy inducer. In addition, liver cells from transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein and human hepatocyte chimeric mice were examined for mitophagy. Translocation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin to the mitochondria was impaired without a reduction of pentaerythritol tetranitrate-induced kinase 1 activity in the presence of HCV infection both in vitro and in vivo. Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that Parkin associated with the HCV core protein. Furthermore, a Yeast Two-Hybrid assay identified a specific interaction between the HCV core protein and an N-terminal Parkin fragment. Silencing Parkin suppressed HCV core protein expression, suggesting a functional role for the interaction between the HCV core protein and Parkin in HCV propagation. The suppressed Parkin translocation to the mitochondria inhibited mitochondrial ubiquitination, decreased the number of mitochondria sequestered in isolation membranes, and reduced autophagic degradation activity. Through a direct interaction with Parkin, the HCV core protein suppressed mitophagy by inhibiting Parkin translocation to the mitochondria. This inhibition may amplify and sustain HCV-induced mitochondrial injury."
25262680,Interaction of stomatin with hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase stabilizes the viral RNA replicase complexes on detergent-resistant membranes.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genome is replicated by an RNA replicase complex (RC) consisting of cellular proteins and viral nonstructural (NS) proteins, including NS5B, an RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and key enzyme for viral RNA genome replication. The HCV RC is known to be associated with an intracellular membrane structure, but the cellular components of the RC and their roles in the formation of the HCV RC have not been well characterized. In this study, we took a proteomic approach to identify stomatin, a member of the integral proteins of lipid rafts, as a cellular protein interacting with HCV NS5B. Coimmunoprecipitation and co-localization studies confirmed the interaction between stomatin and NS5B. We demonstrated that the subcellular fraction containing viral NS proteins and stomatin displays RdRp activity. Membrane flotation assays with the HCV genome replication-competent subcellular fraction revealed that the HCV RdRp and stomatin are associated with the lipid raft-like domain of membranous structures. Stomatin silencing by RNA interference led to the release of NS5B from the detergent-resistant membrane, thereby inhibiting HCV replication in both HCV subgenomic replicon-harboring cells and HCVinfected cells. Our results identify stomatin as a cellular protein that plays a role in the formation of an enzymatically active HCV RC on a detergent-resistant membrane structure."

22072710,HIV-1 Vpu protein antagonizes innate restriction factor BST-2 via lipid-embedded helix-helix interactions.,"The Vpu protein of HIV-1 antagonizes BST-2 (tetherin), a broad spectrum effector of the innate immune response to viral infection, by an intermolecular interaction that maps genetically to the α-helical transmembrane domains (TMDs) of each protein. Here we utilize NMR spectroscopy to describe key features of the helix-helix pairing that underlies this interaction. The antagonism of BST-2 involves a sequence of three alanines and a tryptophan spaced at four residue intervals within the Vpu TMD helix. Responsiveness to Vpu involves bulky hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal region of the BST-2 TMD helix that likely fit between the alanines on the interactive face of Vpu. These aspects of Vpu and BST-2 form an anti-parallel, lipid-embedded helix-helix interface. Changes in human BST-2 that mimic sequences found in nonhuman primate orthologs unresponsive to Vpu change the tilt angle of the TMD in the lipid bilayer without abrogating its intrinsic ability to interact with Vpu. These data explain the mechanism by which HIV-1 evades a key aspect of innate immunity and the species specificity of Vpu using an anti-parallel helix-helix packing model."
21988961,Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) enhances replication of intracellular Salmonella and binds the Salmonella SPI-2 effector SseL via its N-terminus.,"Effectors translocated into the host cell by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are critical for bacterial virulence. For many effectors, the mechanisms of their interactions with host pathways are not yet understood. We have recently found an interaction between the SPI-2 effector SseL and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP). We show here that SseL binds the N-terminus of OSBP and that S. Typhimurium infection results in redistribution of OSBP. We furthermore demonstrate that OSBP is required for efficient replication of intracellular S. Typhimurium. This suggests that S. Typhimurium hijacks OSBP-dependent pathways to benefit its intracellular life-style, possibly by SseL- and OSBP-mediated manipulation of host lipid metabolism."
15567442,Proteomics of herpes simplex virus infected cell protein 27: association with translation initiation factors.,"The herpes simplex virus (HSV) immediate early ICP27 protein plays an essential role in stimulating viral early and late gene expression. ICP27 appears to be multifunctional in that it has been reported to stimulate viral late gene transcription, polyadenylation site usage, and RNA export. We report here on proteomic studies involving immunoprecipitation of ICP27 and mass spectrometric identification of co-precipitated proteins. These studies show an association of ICP27 with the cellular translation initiation factors poly A binding protein (PABP), eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) in infected cells. Immunoprecipitation-western blot studies confirmed these associations. Finally, purified MBP-tagged ICP27 (MBP-27) can interact with eIF3 subunits p47 and p116 in vitro. These results suggest that ICP27 may also play a role in stimulating translation of certain viral and host mRNAs and/or in inhibiting host mRNA translation."
24467650,An immunomodulatory role for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis region of difference 1 locus proteins PE35 (Rv3872) and PPE68 (Rv3873).,"The pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis involves the coordinate action of multiple bacillary components that modulate host immune responses to ensure its survival. One such group of factors is the multigenic PE_PPE protein family, several members of which have been implicated in host immune evasion. Here we investigate the function of the PE-PPE gene pair PE35 (Rv3872)-PPE68 (Rv3873), located in the region of difference 1, encoding a specialized mycobacterial secretion system that is deleted in all vaccine strains of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. We report that this gene pair is co-operonic in M. tuberculosis, and demonstrate that its gene products interact with each other. Stimulation of THP-1 macrophages with recombinant PE35 and PPE68, singly or in combination, led to a dose-dependent increase in levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 and the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and caused a reciprocal decrease in levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12. PE35/PPE68-stimulated production of IL-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was observed to be dependent on toll-like receptor 2, as receptor blockade caused a significant reduction in their levels. Pharmacological inhibition indicated that this induction involved activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling axis. In a transwell migration assay, culture supernatants from PE35/PPE68-treated THP-1 cells were observed to stimulate the migration of monocytes. Our findings suggest that the PE35-PPE68 gene pair plays an important immunomodulatory role in regulating the pathophysiology of M. tuberculosis."
23935490,The Salmonella type III effector SspH2 specifically exploits the NLR co-chaperone activity of SGT1 to subvert immunity.,"To further its pathogenesis, S. Typhimurium delivers effector proteins into host cells, including the novel E3 ubiquitin ligase (NEL) effector SspH2. Using model systems in a cross-kingdom approach we gained further insight into the molecular function of this effector. Here, we show that SspH2 modulates innate immunity in both mammalian and plant cells. In mammalian cell culture, SspH2 significantly enhanced Nod1-mediated IL-8 secretion when transiently expressed or bacterially delivered. In addition, SspH2 also enhanced an Rx-dependent hypersensitive response in planta. In both of these nucleotide-binding leucine rich repeat receptor (NLR) model systems, SspH2-mediated phenotypes required its catalytic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and interaction with the conserved host protein SGT1. SGT1 has an essential cell cycle function and an additional function as an NLR co-chaperone in animal and plant cells. Interaction between SspH2 and SGT1 was restricted to SGT1 proteins that have NLR co-chaperone function and accordingly, SspH2 did not affect SGT1 cell cycle functions. Mechanistic studies revealed that SspH2 interacted with, and ubiquitinated Nod1 and could induce Nod1 activity in an agonist-independent manner if catalytically active. Interestingly, SspH2 in vitro ubiquitination activity and protein stability were enhanced by SGT1. Overall, this work adds to our understanding of the sophisticated mechanisms used by bacterial effectors to co-opt host pathways by demonstrating that SspH2 can subvert immune responses by selectively exploiting the functions of a conserved host co-chaperone."
25122793,Apolipoprotein E likely contributes to a maturation step of infectious hepatitis C virus particles and interacts with viral envelope glycoproteins.,"The assembly of infectious hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles is tightly linked to components of the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) pathway. We and others have shown that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a major role in production of infectious HCV particles. However, the mechanism by which ApoE contributes to virion assembly/release and how it gets associated with the HCV particle is poorly understood. We found that knockdown of ApoE reduces titers of infectious intra- and extracellular HCV but not of the related dengue virus. ApoE depletion also reduced amounts of extracellular HCV core protein without affecting intracellular core amounts. Moreover, we found that ApoE depletion affected neither formation of nucleocapsids nor their envelopment, suggesting that ApoE acts at a late step of assembly, such as particle maturation and infectivity. Importantly, we demonstrate that ApoE interacts with the HCV envelope glycoproteins, most notably E2. This interaction did not require any other viral proteins and depended on the transmembrane domain of E2 that also was required for recruitment of HCV envelope glycoproteins to detergent-resistant membrane fractions. These results suggest that ApoE plays an important role in HCV particle maturation, presumably by direct interaction with viral envelope glycoproteins."
16876117,Interaction of hepatitis C virus F protein with prefoldin 2 perturbs tubulin cytoskeleton organization.,"By use of the yeast two-hybrid system, hepatitis C virus (HCV) F protein was found to interact with a cellular protein named prefoldin 2. The interaction was confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy as well as coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Prefoldin 2 is a subunit of a hexameric molecular chaperone complex, named prefoldin, which delivers nascent actin and tubulin proteins to the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin for facilitated folding. Functional prefoldin spontaneously assembles from its six subunits (prefoldin 1-6). In the yeast three-hybrid system, it was found that expression of HCV F protein impeded the interaction between prefoldin 1 and 2. By performing immunofluorescence experiment and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, it was shown that expression of HCV F protein resulted in aberrant organization of tubulin cytoskeleton. Since HCV replication requires intact microtubule and actin polymerization, HCV F protein may serve as a modulator to prevent high level of HCV replication and thus contributes to viral persistence in chronic HCV infection."
17275127,HCV NS5A inhibits interferon-alpha signaling through suppression of STAT1 phosphorylation in hepatocyte-derived cell lines.,HCV NS5A appears to play an important role in HCV resistance to IFN-alpha but the molecular mechanism is not fully elucidated. Most studies regarding the involvement of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in inhibition of IFN-alpha signaling by NS5A were performed in non-hepatic cell lines and their relevance may be debatable.
22496234,Proteomic profiling of EBNA1-host protein interactions in latent and lytic Epstein-Barr virus infections.,"The Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is expressed in both latent and lytic modes of EBV infection and contributes to EBV-associated cancers. Using a proteomics approach, we profiled EBNA1-host protein interactions in nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinoma cells in the context of latent and lytic EBV infection. We identified several interactions that occur in both modes of infection, including a previously unreported interaction with nucleophosmin and RNA-mediated interactions with several heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) and La protein."
19690162,Salmonella type III secretion effector SlrP is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for mammalian thioredoxin.,"Salmonella enterica encodes two virulence-related type III secretion systems in Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2, respectively. These systems mediate the translocation of protein effectors into the eukaryotic host cell, where they alter cell signaling and manipulate host cell functions. However, the precise role of most effectors remains unknown. Using a genetic screen, we identified the small, reduction/oxidation-regulatory protein thioredoxin as a mammalian binding partner of the Salmonella effector SlrP. The interaction was confirmed by affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation. In vitro, SlrP was able to mediate ubiquitination of ubiquitin and thioredoxin. A Cys residue conserved in other effectors of the same family that also possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was essential for this catalytic function. Stable expression of SlrP in HeLa cells resulted in a significant decrease of thioredoxin activity and in an increase of cell death. The physiological significance of these results was strengthened by the finding that Salmonella was able to trigger cell death and inhibit thioredoxin activity in HeLa cells several hours post-infection. This study assigns a functional role to the Salmonella effector SlrP as a binding partner and an E3 ubiquitin ligase for mammalian thioredoxin."
21435037,Interaction of the Salmonella Typhimurium effector protein SopB with host cell Cdc42 is involved in intracellular replication.,"The phosphoinositide phosphatase SopB/SigD is a type III secretion system effector that plays multiple roles in Salmonella internalization and intracellular survival. We previously reported that SopB complexed with and inhibited the small GTPase Cdc42 when expressed in a yeast model system, independently of its phosphatase activity. Here we show that human Cdc42, but not Rac1, interacts with catalytically inactive SopB when coexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This interaction occurs with both constitutively active and non-activatable Cdc42, suggesting that SopB binds Cdc42 independently of its activation state. By mutational analysis we have narrowed the Cdc42-interacting region of SopB to the first 142 amino acids, and isolated a collection of point mutations in this region, mainly affecting leucine residues conserved in the related Shigella IpgD protein. Such mutations yielded SopB unable to interact with Cdc42 but maintained phosphatase activity. SopB mutant proteins defective for binding Cdc42 were ubiquitinated upon translocation in mammalian cells, but their localization to the Salmonella-containing vacuole was reduced compared with wild-type SopB. Whereas invasion of mammalian cells by Salmonella bearing these sopB mutations was not affected, intracellular replication was less efficient, suggesting that SopB-Cdc42 interaction contributes to the adaptation of Salmonella to the intracellular environment."
21566117,Quantitative mass spectrometry catalogues Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 effectors and identifies their cognate host binding partners.,"Gram-negative bacterial pathogens have developed specialized secretion systems to transfer bacterial proteins directly into host cells. These bacterial effectors are central to virulence and reprogram host cell processes to favor bacterial survival, colonization, and proliferation. Knowing the complete set of effectors encoded by a particular pathogen is the key to understanding bacterial disease. In addition, the identification of the molecular assemblies that these effectors engage once inside the host cell is critical to determining the mechanism of action of each effector. In this work we used stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), a powerful quantitative proteomics technique, to identify the proteins secreted by the Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 type three secretion system (SPI-2 T3SS) and to characterize the host interaction partners of SPI-2 effectors. We confirmed many of the known SPI-2 effectors and were able to identify several novel substrate candidates of this secretion system. We verified previously published host protein-effector binding pairs and obtained 11 novel interactions, three of which were investigated further and confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. The host cell interaction partners identified here suggest that Salmonella SPI-2 effectors target, in a concerted fashion, cellular processes such as cell attachment and cell cycle control that are underappreciated in the context of infection. The technology outlined in this study is specific and sensitive and serves as a robust tool for the identification of effectors and their host targets that is readily amenable to the study of other bacterial pathogens."
16760390,Negative regulation of hepatitis B virus replication by cellular Hsp40/DnaJ proteins through destabilization of viral core and X proteins.,"The hepatitis B virus core protein consists of an amino-terminal capsid-assembly domain and a carboxyl-terminal RNA-binding domain. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, two Hsp40/DnaJ chaperone-family proteins, Hdj1 and hTid1, that interact with the carboxyl-terminal region (aa 94-185) of the core protein were identified. Hdj1 is the prototype member of the family and hTid1 is the human homologue of the Drosophila tumour-suppressor protein Tid56. Binding of the viral core protein with the Hsp40 proteins was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation of transiently expressed proteins. Moreover, in a sucrose gradient, the precursor form of hTid1 co-sedimented with capsid-like particles composed of the full-length core protein. Unlike the general perception of the role of the cellular chaperone proteins in assisting viral protein folding and thus enhancing virus replication, ectopic expression of Hdj1 and hTid1 suppressed replication of HBV in transfected human hepatoma cells. Conversely, RNA interference-mediated knock-down of hTid1 resulted in increased HBV replication. It was found that both Hsp40 proteins specifically accelerated degradation of the viral core and HBx proteins. Our results suggest that the cellular chaperones, through destabilization of viral proteins, exert inhibitory functions on virus replication and hence may play suppressive roles in hepatocellular carcinoma."
10754391,Hepatitis B virus core protein interacts with the C-terminal region of actin-binding protein.,"Hepatitis B viral core protein is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected hepatocytes. There is a strong correlation between the intrahepatic distribution of core protein and the viral replication state and disease activity in patients with chronic hepatitis. To understand the role of core protein in the pathogenesis of HBV, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to search for cellular proteins interacting with the carboxyl terminus of core protein, as this region is involved in a number of important functions in the viral replication cycle including RNA packaging and DNA synthesis. A cDNA encoding the extreme C-terminal region of human actin-binding protein, ABP-276/278, was identified. This interaction was further confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the extreme C-terminal region of ABP-276/278 interacted with the nearly full-length HBV core protein. Since this region is present in both the core and the precore proteins, it is likely that both core and precore proteins of HBV can interact with the C-terminal region of ABP-276/278. The minimal region of ABP-276/278 which interacted with the HBV core protein was the C-terminal 199 amino acid residues which correspond to part of the 23rd repeat, the entire 24th repeat and the intervening hinge II region in ABPs. The potential functional outcome of ABP interaction in HBV replication and its contribution to the pathological changes seen in patients with chronic HBV infection are discussed."
8756622,Interaction of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 tax transactivator with transcription factor IIA.,"The Tax protein of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a 40-kDa transcriptional activator which is critical for HTLV-1 gene regulation and virus-induced cellular transformation. Tax is localized to the DNA through its interaction with the site-specific activators cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein, NF-kappaB, and serum response factor. It has been suggested that the recruitment of Tax to the DNA positions Tax for interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery. On the basis of several independent assays, we now report a physical and functional interaction between Tax and the transcription factor, TFIIA. First, Tax was found to interact with the 35-kDa (alpha) subunit of TFIIA in the yeast two-hybrid interaction system. Importantly, two previously characterized mutants with point mutations in Tax, M32 (Y196A, K197S) and M41 (H287A, P288S), which were shown to be defective in Tax-activated transcription were unable to interact with TFIIA in this assay. Second, a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) affinity-binding assay showed that the interaction of holo-TFIIA with GST-Tax was 20-fold higher than that observed with either the GST-Tax M32 activation mutant or the GST control. Third, a coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that in HTLV-1-infected human T lymphocytes, Tax and TFIIA were associated. Finally, TFIIA facilitates Tax transactivation in vitro and in vivo. In vitro transcription studies showed reduced levels of Tax-activated transcription in cell extracts depleted of TFIIA. In addition, transfection of human T lymphocytes with TFIIA expression vectors enhanced Tax-activated transcription of an HTLV-1 long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct. Our study suggests that the interaction of Tax with the transcription factor TFIIA may play a role in Tax-mediated transcriptional activation."
17596301,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ORF6 antagonizes STAT1 function by sequestering nuclear import factors on the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membrane.,"The host innate immune response is an important deterrent of severe viral infection in humans and animals. Nuclear import factors function as key gatekeepers that regulate the transport of innate immune regulatory cargo to the nucleus of cells to activate the antiviral response. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model, we demonstrate that SARS-COV ORF6 protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi membrane in infected cells, where it binds to and disrupts nuclear import complex formation by tethering karyopherin alpha 2 and karyopherin beta 1 to the membrane. Retention of import factors at the ER/Golgi membrane leads to a loss of STAT1 transport into the nucleus in response to interferon signaling, thus blocking the expression of STAT1-activated genes that establish an antiviral state. We mapped the region of ORF6, which binds karyopherin alpha 2, to the C terminus of ORF6 and show that mutations in the C terminus no longer bind karyopherin alpha 2 or block the nuclear import of STAT1. We also show that N-terminal deletions of karyopherin alpha 2 that no longer bind to karyopherin beta 1 still retain ORF6 binding activity but no longer block STAT1 nuclear import. Recombinant SARS-CoV lacking ORF6 did not tether karyopherin alpha 2 to the ER/Golgi membrane and allowed the import of the STAT1 complex into the nucleus. We discuss the likely implications of these data on SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis."
25944354,Host interactions of Chandipura virus matrix protein.,"The rhabdovirus matrix (M) protein is a multifunctional virion protein that plays major role in virus assembly and budding, virus-induced inhibition of host gene expression and cytopathic effects observed in infected cells. The myriad roles played by this protein in the virus biology make it a critical player in viral pathogenesis. Therefore, discerning the interactions of this protein with host can greatly facilitate our understanding of virus infections, ultimately leading to both improved therapeutics and insight into cellular processes. Chandipura virus (CHPV; Family Rhabdoviridae, Genus Vesiculovirus) is an emerging rhabdovirus responsible for several outbreaks of fatal encephalitis among children in India. The present study aims to screen the human fetal brain cDNA library for interactors of CHPV M protein using yeast two-hybrid system. Ten host protein interactors were identified, three of which were further validated by affinity pull down and protein interaction ELISA. The study identified novel human host interactors for CHPV which concurred with previously described associations in other human viruses."
9434725,"An imperfect correlation between DNA replication activity of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and binding to the nuclear import receptor, Rch1/importin alpha.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) replicates as a stable multicopy episome in latently infected mammalian cells. Latent cycle DNA replication requires only two viral elements, the cis-acting origin of plasmid replication (oriP) and the trans-acting origin binding protein (EBNA1). EBNA1 binds multiple recognition sites in oriP, but has not other enzymatic activities associated with replication functions. To identify human cellular proteins that mediate EBNA1 function, we designed a one-hybrid assay in yeast to select for proteins that bind to EBNA1 when bound to criP in vivo. A human cDNA encoding the Rch1/hSRP1 alpha/ importin alpha protein was isolated and shown to bind to full-length EBNA1, but not to an amino terminal deletion mutant of EBNA1 when bound to oriP in yeast. The interaction of EBNA1 with Rch1 was confirmed biochemically by coimmunoprecipitation from nuclear extracts and by direct binding of recombinant proteins in vitro. Internal deletion mutations in EBNA1 which compromised DNA replication activity were similarly reduced for binding to Rch1. Mutations with no effect on DNA replication activity were similarly unaffected for Rch1 binding. Rch1/importin alpha has been shown to bind to the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of several proteins and stimulate nuclear import. A substitution mutation in the EBNA1 nuclear localization sequence reduced Rch1 binding, but had no effect on DNA replication function, indicating that Rch1 binding affinity does not correspond precisely with replication activity. Nevertheless, the identification of a stable interaction between Rch1 and EBNA1 at the origin of viral DNA replication raises the intriguing possibility that Rch1 contributes to the nuclear functions of EBNA1."
12186903,Analysis of the adenovirus E1B-55K-anchored proteome reveals its link to ubiquitination machinery.,"During the early phase of infection, the E1B-55K protein of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) counters the E1A-induced stabilization of p53, whereas in the late phase, E1B-55K modulates the preferential nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation of the late viral mRNAs. The mechanism(s) by which E1B-55K performs these functions has not yet been clearly elucidated. In this study, we have taken a proteomics-based approach to identify and characterize novel E1B-55K-associated proteins. A multiprotein E1B-55K-containing complex was immunopurified from Ad5-infected HeLa cells and found to contain E4-orf6, as well as several cellular factors previously implicated in the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated destruction of proteins, including Cullin-5, Rbx1/ROC1/Hrt1, and Elongins B and C. We further demonstrate that a complex containing these as well as other proteins is capable of directing the polyubiquitination of p53 in vitro. These ubiquitin ligase components were found in a high-molecular-mass complex of 800 to 900 kDa. We propose that these newly identified binding partners (Cullin-5, Elongins B and C, and Rbx1) complex with E1B-55K and E4-orf6 during Ad infection to form part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets specific protein substrates for degradation. We further suggest that E1B-55K functions as the principal substrate recognition component of this SCF-type ubiquitin ligase, whereas E4-orf6 may serve to nucleate the assembly of the complex. Lastly, we describe the identification and characterization of two novel E1B-55K interacting factors, importin-alpha 1 and pp32, that may also participate in the functions previously ascribed to E1B-55K and E4-orf6."
10189367,Phosphorylation-dependent binding of hepatitis B virus core particles to the nuclear pore complex.,"Although many viruses replicate in the nucleus, little is known about the processes involved in the nuclear import of viral genomes. We show here that in vitro generated core particles of human hepatitis B virus bind to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in digitonin-permeabilized mammalian cells. This only occurred if the cores contained phosphorylated core proteins. Binding was inhibited by wheat germ agglutinin, by antinuclear pore complex antibodies, and by peptides corresponding either to classical nuclear localization signals (NLS) or to COOH-terminal sequences of the core protein. Binding was dependent on the nuclear transport factors importins (karyopherins) alpha and beta. The results suggested that phosphorylation induces exposure of NLS in the COOH-terminal portion of the core protein that allows core binding to the NPCs by the importin- (karyopherin-) mediated pathway. Thus, phosphorylation of the core protein emerged as an important step in the viral replication cycle necessary for transport of the viral genome to the nucleus."
18248089,Interaction of polymerase subunit PB2 and NP with importin alpha1 is a determinant of host range of influenza A virus.,"We have previously reported that mutations in the polymerase proteins PB1, PB2, PA, and the nucleocapsid protein NP resulting in enhanced transcription and replication activities in mammalian cells are responsible for the conversion of the avian influenza virus SC35 (H7N7) into the mouse-adapted variant SC35M. We show now that adaptive mutations D701N in PB2 and N319K in NP enhance binding of these proteins to importin alpha1 in mammalian cells. Enhanced binding was paralleled by transient nuclear accumulation and cytoplasmic depletion of importin alpha1 as well as increased transport of PB2 and NP into the nucleus of mammalian cells. In avian cells, enhancement of importin alpha1 binding and increased nuclear transport were not observed. These findings demonstrate that adaptation of the viral polymerase to the nuclear import machinery plays an important role in interspecies transmission of influenza virus."
12522210,Identification of a lactoferrin-derived peptide possessing binding activity to hepatitis C virus E2 envelope protein.,"Bovine and human lactoferrins (LF) prevent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in cultured human hepatocytes; the preventive mechanism is thought to be the direct interaction between LF and HCV. To clarify this hypothesis, we have characterized the binding activity of LF to HCV E2 envelope protein and have endeavored to determine which region(s) of LF are important for this binding activity. Several regions of human LF have been expressed and purified as thioredoxin-fused proteins in Escherichia coli. Far-Western blot analysis using these LF fragments and the E2 protein, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, revealed that the 93 carboxyl amino acids of LF specifically bound to the E2 protein. The 93 carboxyl amino acids of LFs derived from bovine and horse cells also possessed similar binding activity to the E2 protein. In addition, the amino acid sequences of these carboxyl regions appeared to show partial homology to CD81, a candidate receptor for HCV, and the binding activity of these carboxyl regions was also comparable with that of CD81. Further deletion analysis identified 33 amino acid residues as the minimum binding site in the carboxyl region of LF, and the binding specificity of these 33 amino acids was also confirmed by using 33 maltose-binding protein-fused amino acids. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the 33 maltose-binding protein-fused amino acids prevented HCV infection in cultured human hepatocytes. In addition, the site-directed mutagenesis to an Ala residue in both terminal residues of the 33 amino acids revealed that Cys at amino acid 628 was determined to be critical for binding to the E2 protein. These results led us to consider the development of an effective anti-HCV peptide. This is the first identification of a natural protein-derived peptide that specifically binds to HCV E2 protein and prevents HCV infection."
10440932,Nuclear import of HPV11 L1 capsid protein is mediated by karyopherin alpha2beta1 heterodimers.,"L1 major capsid proteins of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) enter the nuclei of host cells at two times during the viral life cycle: 1) after infection and 2) later during the productive phase, when they assemble the replicated HPV genomic DNA into infectious virions. L1 proteins are stable in two oligomeric configurations: as homopentameric capsomers, and as capsids composed of 72 capsomers. We found that intact L1 capsids of HPV type 11 cannot enter the nucleus, suggesting that capsid disassembly may be required for HPV11 L1 nuclear import. We established that HPV11 L1 is imported in a receptor-mediated manner into the nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells. HPV11 L1 docked at the nuclear pore complexes via karyopherin alpha2beta1 heterodimers. Anti-karyopherin-beta1 and anti-karyopherin alpha2 antibodies specifically inhibited nuclear import of HPV11 L1. Moreover, nuclear import of HPV11 L1 could be reconstituted using karyopherin alpha2, beta1, RanGDP and p10. In agreement with the docking and import data, we found that HPV11 L1 binds to karyopherin alpha2 and that this interaction is inhibited by a peptide representing the classical nuclear localization signal of SV40 T antigen. These results strongly suggest that HPV11 L1 enters the nucleus of the infected host cell via the karyopherin alpha2beta1 pathway."
25312088,Investigation of membrane protein-protein interactions using correlative FRET-PLA.,Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis and the recently developed proximity ligation assay (PLA) are widely used to study protein-protein interactions in situ. We have developed correlative FRET-PLA to monitor interactions between membrane proteins that frequently cause problems in confirmatory co-immunoprecipitation assays. Correlative FRET-PLA is particularly aimed at delivering robust and reliable results and is useful for investigating protein-protein interactions.
19887681,Activation of a bacterial virulence protein by the GTPase RhoA.,"The Rho family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) are essential eukaryotic signaling molecules that regulate cellular physiology. Virulence factors from various pathogens alter the signaling of GTPases by acting as GTPase activating factors, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, or direct covalent modifiers; however, bacterial virulence factors that sense rather than alter the signaling states of Rho GTPases have not been previously described. Here, we report that the translocated Salmonellae virulence factor SseJ binds to the guanosine triphosphate-bound form of RhoA. This interaction stimulates the lipase activity of SseJ, which results in the esterification of cholesterol in the host cell membrane. Our results suggest that the activation of molecules downstream of GTPases is not exclusive to eukaryotic proteins, and that a bacterial protein has evolved to recognize the activation state of RhoA, which regulates its enzymatic activity as part of the host-pathogen interaction."
16007207,Hepatitis C virus core variants isolated from liver tumor but not from adjacent non-tumor tissue interact with Smad3 and inhibit the TGF-beta pathway.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major risk factor for human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the mechanisms underlying HCV-induced carcinogenesis are still poorly understood. We have hypothesized that viral variants, selected during long-term infection, might contribute to cellular transformation. To address this issue, we have investigated the effect of natural HCV core variants isolated from liver tumors (T), or their non-tumor (NT) counterparts, on the tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathway, a major regulator of cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. We have found a significant reduction in TGF-beta reporter gene activity with the expression of core sequences isolated from liver tumors. In contrast, moderate or no effects were observed with non-tumor mutants or a core reference sequence. The molecular mechanisms have been characterized and involved the inhibition, by tumor-derived cores, of the DNA-binding activity of the Smad3/4 transcription factors complex. This inhibition occurs through a direct interaction between the central domain (amino acids 59-126) of tumor-derived core and the MH1 DNA-binding domain of Smad3, thus preventing its binding to DNA. We have therefore identified a new cell-signaling pathway targeted by HCV core and inhibited by tumor-derived core sequences. These results suggest that during chronic infection, there is selection of viral variants that may promote cell transformation by providing, to clonally expanding cells, resistance to TGF-beta antiproliferative effects."
15039538,"Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein interacts with 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and inhibits antiviral activity of IFN in an IFN sensitivity-determining region-independent manner.","The non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been implicated in inhibition of antiviral activity of IFN. While previous studies have suggested an interaction between NS5A and the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), the possibility still remains that interaction with another molecule(s) is involved in the NS5A-mediated inhibition of IFN. In the present study, we investigated a possible interaction between NS5A and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5AS), another key molecule in antiviral activity. We observed that NS5A physically interacted with 2-5AS in cultured cells, with an N-terminal portion of NS5A [aa 1-148; NS5A(1-148)] and two separate portions of 2-5AS (aa 52-104 and 184-275) being involved in the interaction. Single point mutations at residue 37 of NS5A affected the degree of the interaction with 2-5AS, with a Phe-to-Leu mutation (F37L) augmenting and a Phe-to-Asn mutation (F37N) diminishing it. Virus rescue assay revealed that the full-length NS5A (NS5A-F) and NS5A(1-148), the latter of which contains neither the IFN sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) nor the PKR-binding domain, significantly counteracted the antiviral activity of IFN. Introduction of a F37N mutation into NS5A(1-148) impaired the otherwise more significant IFN-inhibitory activity of NS5A(1-148). It was also found that the F37N mutation was highly disadvantageous for the replication of an HCV RNA replicon. Taken together, our results suggest the possibility that NS5A interacts with 2-5AS and inhibits the antiviral activity of IFN in an ISDR-independent manner."
25193851,The intracellular inhibition of HCV replication represents a novel mechanism of action by the innate immune Lactoferrin protein.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public-health problem with 130-170 million individuals chronically infected worldwide. In order to halt the epidemic, therapy against HCV will need to be both effective and widely available. Studies focusing on safe and affordable natural product active against HCV have revealed the antiviral activity of the human Lactoferrin (hLF) protein which binds and neutralizes the circulating virion. In the current study, investigation of hLF activity on the HCV subgenomic replicon system, which is independent from viral entry and shedding, revealed a distinct antireplicative activity of hLF against HCV. Hepatocellular uptake of hLF was confirmed and correlated with qualitative HCV staining reduction. Quantitative dose-response inhibition assays confirmed an hLF-mediated and dose-dependent HCV replication reduction reaching up to 60%. The in cellulo anti-HCV activity of hLF was additive to both Ribavirin and Interferon-α-2b. Further investigation of hLF activity against the essential viral proteins involved in HCV genome replication revealed an inhibitory activity against the HCV ATPase/Helicase NS3 protein but not against the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B protein). NS3 inhibition was mediated by a direct and specific interaction between hLF and an allosteric binding site on NS3. Taken together, our findings reveal a new antiviral mechanism of action by which hLF inhibits intracellular HCV replication."
20579884,Salmonella-directed recruitment of new membrane to invasion foci via the host exocyst complex.,"Salmonella attachment to the intestinal epithelium triggers delivery of bacterial effector proteins into the host cytosol through a type III secretion system (T3SS), leading to pronounced membrane ruffling and macropinocytic uptake of attached bacteria. The tip of the T3SS is made up of two proteins, SipB and SipC, which insert into the host plasma membrane, forming a translocation pore. Both the N and C termini of SipC are exposed in the host cytosol and have been shown to directly modulate actin cytoskeleton assembly. We have identified a direct interaction between SipC and Exo70, a component of the exocyst complex, which mediates docking and fusion of exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane. Here, we show that exocyst components coprecipitate with SipC and accumulate at sites of invasion by Salmonella typhimurium. Exocyst assembly requires activation of the small GTPase RalA, which we show is triggered during Salmonella infection by the translocated effector, SopE. Knockdown of RalA or Sec5 results in reduced membrane ruffling at sites of attachment and impairs bacterial entry into host cells. These findings suggest that S. typhimurium enhances invasion efficiency by promoting localized membrane expansion, directly through SipC-dependent recruitment of the exocyst and indirectly via SopE-dependent activation of RalA."
24625804,Caveolin-1 mediates Salmonella invasion via the regulation of SopE-dependent Rac1 activation and actin reorganization.,"Caveolar endocytosis has an important function in the cellular uptake of some bacterial toxins, viruses, and circulating proteins. However, the molecular machinery involved in caveolae-dependent bacterial endocytosis is poorly defined. In the present study, we identify a new molecular mechanism for the caveolin-1-dependent entry of Salmonella into host cells via the direct regulation of actin reorganization. In contrast to the interaction of caveolae with other pathogens, the caveolae did not form Salmonella-containing vesicles or endosomes in the host cells. Instead, the caveolae rapidly moved to the apical plasma membrane upon actin condensation during early invasion. Interestingly, the injected bacterial protein SopE interacted with Rac1 to regulate actin reorganization, and both proteins colocalized and directly interacted with caveolin-1 in caveolae during early invasion. After the complete internalization of Salmonella, SopE levels decreased both in the caveolae and in the host cytoplasm; Rac1 activity was also decreased. Downregulation of caveolin-1 by siRNA treatment led to reduction of Salmonella invasion compared with control siRNA-treated cells. These results suggest a new model in which caveolin-1 might be involved in Salmonella entry via its interaction with SopE and Rac1, leading to enhanced membrane ruffling for phagocytosis into host cells."
12163594,Identification and characterization of a regulatory domain on the carboxyl terminus of the measles virus nucleocapsid protein.,"The paramyxovirus template for transcription and genome replication consists of the RNA genome encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein (N protein). The activity of the complex, consisting of viral polymerase plus template, can be measured with minireplicons in which the genomic coding sequence is replaced by chloramphenical acetyltransferase (CAT) antisense RNA. Using this approach, we showed that the C-terminal 24 amino acids of the measles virus N protein are dispensable for transcription and replication, based upon the truncation of N proteins used to support minireplicon reporter gene expression. Truncation at the C-terminal or penultimate amino acid 524 resulted in no change in CAT expression, whereas larger truncations spanning residues 523 to 502 were accompanied by an approximately twofold increase in basal activity. Reporter gene expression was enhanced by supplementation with the major inducible 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp72) for minireplicons with the N protein or the N protein truncated at position 525 or 524 but not in systems with a truncation at position 523 or 522. Naturally occurring sequence variants of the N protein with variations at positions 522 and 523 were also shown to lack Hsp72 responsiveness independent of changes in basal activity. Since these residues lie within a linear sequence predicting a direct Hsp72 interaction, N protein-Hsp72 binding reactions were analyzed by using surface plasmon resonance technology. Truncation of the C-terminal portion of the N protein by protease digestion resulted in a reduced binding affinity between Hsp72 and the N protein. Furthermore, with synthetic peptides, we established a correlation between the functional responsiveness and the binding affinity for Hsp72 of C-terminal N protein sequences. Collectively, these results show that the C-terminal 24 amino acids of the N protein represent a regulatory domain containing a functional motif that mediates a direct interaction with Hsp72."
16189009,Dissection of a novel nuclear localization signal in open reading frame 29 of varicella-zoster virus.,"Open reading frame 29 (ORF29) of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) encodes a 120-kDa single-stranded DNA binding protein (ORF29p) that is not packaged in the virion and is expressed during latency. During lytic infection, ORF29p is localized primarily to infected cell nuclei. In contrast, ORF29p is found exclusively in the cytoplasm in neurons of the dorsal root ganglia obtained at autopsy from seropositive latently infected patients. ORF29p accumulates in the nuclei of neurons in dorsal root ganglia obtained at autopsy from patients with active zoster. The localization of this protein is, therefore, tightly correlated with the proposed VZV lytic/latent switch. In this report, we have investigated the nuclear import mechanism of ORF29p. We identified a novel nuclear targeting domain bounded by amino acids 9 to 154 of ORF29p that functions independent of other VZV-encoded factors. In vitro import assays in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells reveal that ORF29p is transported into the nucleus by a Ran-, karyopherin alpha- and beta-dependent mechanism. These data are further supported by the demonstration that a glutathione S-transferase-karyopherin alpha fusion interacts with ORF29p, but not with a protein containing a point mutation in its nuclear localization signal (NLS). Therefore, the region of ORF29p responsible for its nuclear targeting is also involved in the association with karyopherin alpha. As a result of this interaction, this noncanonical NLS appears to hijack the classical cellular nuclear import machinery. Elucidation of the mechanisms governing ORF29p nuclear targeting could shed light on the VZV reactivation process."
19176627,The infected cell protein 0 encoded by bovine herpesvirus 1 (bICP0) associates with interferon regulatory factor 7 and consequently inhibits beta interferon promoter activity.,"The bICP0 protein encoded by bovine herpesvirus 1 stimulates productive infection and viral gene expression but inhibits interferon (IFN)-dependent transcription. bICP0 inhibits beta IFN (IFN-beta) promoter activity and induces degradation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Although bICP0 inhibits the trans-activation activity of IRF7, IRF7 protein levels are not reduced. In this study, we demonstrate that bICP0 is associated with IRF7. Furthermore, bICP0 inhibits the ability of IRF7 to trans-activate the IFN-beta promoter in the absence of IRF3 expression. The interaction between bICP0 and IRF7 correlates with reduced trans-activation of the IFN-beta promoter by IRF7."
23892143,"Human respiratory syncytial virus N, P and M protein interactions in HEK-293T cells.","Characterization of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (HRSV) protein interactions with host cell components is crucial to devise antiviral strategies. Viral nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein and matrix protein genes were optimized for human codon usage and cloned into expression vectors. HEK-293T cells were transfected with these vectors, viral proteins were immunoprecipitated, and co-immunoprecipitated cellular proteins were identified through mass spectrometry. Cell proteins identified with higher confidence scores were probed in the immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies. The results indicate that nucleoprotein interacts with arginine methyl-transferase, methylosome protein and Hsp70. Phosphoprotein interacts with Hsp70 and tropomysin, and matrix with tropomysin and nucleophosmin. Additionally, we performed immunoprecipitation of these cellular proteins in cells infected with HRSV, followed by detection of co-immunoprecipitated viral proteins. The results indicate that these interactions also occur in the context of viral infection, and their potential contribution for a HRSV replication model is discussed."
11559788,The bovine herpesvirus 1 immediate-early protein (bICP0) associates with histone deacetylase 1 to activate transcription.,"Infected-cell protein 0 encoded by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) (bICP0) is necessary for efficient productive infection, in large part, because it activates all 3 classes of BHV-1 genes (U. V. Wirth, C. Fraefel, B. Vogt, C. Vlcek, V. Paces, and M. Schwyzer, J. Virol. 66:2763-2772, 1992). Although bICP0 is believed to be a functional homologue of herpes simplex virus type 1-encoded ICP0, the only well-conserved domain between the proteins is a zinc ring finger located near the amino terminus of both proteins. Our previous studies demonstrated that bICP0 is toxic to transfected cells but does not appear to directly induce apoptosis (Inman, M., Y. Zhang, V. Geiser, and C. Jones, J. Gen. Virol. 82:483-492, 2001). C-terminal sequences in the last 320 amino acids of bICP0 mediate subcellular localization. Mutagenesis of the zinc ring finger within bICP0 revealed that this domain was important for transcriptional activation. In this study, we demonstrate that bICP0 interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), which results in activation of a simple promoter containing four consensus Myc-Max binding sites. The interaction between bICP0 and HDAC1 correlated with inhibition of Mad-dependent transcriptional repression. In resting CV-1 cells, bICP0 relieved HDAC1-mediated transcriptional repression. The zinc ring finger was required for relieving HDAC1-induced repression but not for interacting with HDAC1. In fetal bovine lung cells but not in a human epithelial cell line, bICP0 expression correlated with reduced steady-state levels of HDAC1 in crude cytoplasmic extracts. We hypothesize that the ability of bICP0 to overcome HDAC1-induced repression plays a role in promoting productive infection in highly differentiated cell types."
20335166,"The Salmonella type III secretion effector, salmonella leucine-rich repeat protein (SlrP), targets the human chaperone ERdj3.","Effectors of the type III secretion systems (T3SS) are key elements in the interaction between many Gram-negative pathogens and their hosts. SlrP is an effector that is translocated into the eukaryotic host cell through the two virulence-associated T3SS of Salmonella enterica. We found previously that this effector is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for mammalian thioredoxin. Here, we identified ERdj3, an endoplasmic reticulum lumenal chaperone of the Hsp40/DnaJ family, as a new target for SlrP. Experiments with truncated forms of ERdj3 showed that domain II was essential for the interaction with SlrP. Confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation demonstrated that, in transfected HeLa cells, SlrP was partially located in the endoplasmic reticulum. The presence of SlrP interfered with the binding of ERdj3 to a denatured substrate. Taken together, these data suggest that the role of SlrP in the interaction between Salmonella and the host cell is exerted through the modulation of the function of two independent targets: thioredoxin in the cytosol, and ERdj3 in the endoplasmic reticulum."
18996344,"Structure and function of Salmonella SifA indicate that its interactions with SKIP, SseJ, and RhoA family GTPases induce endosomal tubulation.","The Salmonella typhimurium type III secretion effector protein SifA is essential for inducing tubulation of the Salmonella phagosome and binds the mammalian kinesin-binding protein SKIP. Coexpression of SifA with the effector SseJ induced tubulation of mammalian cell endosomes, similar to that induced by Salmonella infection. Interestingly, GTP-bound RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC also induced endosomal tubulation when coexpressed with SseJ, indicating that SifA likely mimics or activates a RhoA family GTPase. The structure of SifA in complex with the PH domain of SKIP revealed that SifA has two distinct domains; the amino terminus binds SKIP, and the carboxyl terminus has a fold similar to SopE, a Salmonella effector with Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity (GEF). Similar to GEFs, SifA interacted with GDP-bound RhoA, and purified SseJ and RhoA formed a protein complex, suggesting that SifA, SKIP, SseJ, and RhoA family GTPases cooperatively promote host membrane tubulation."
26602083,Binding and entry of Clostridium difficile toxin B is mediated by multiple domains.,"Clostridium difficile is responsible for a number of serious gastrointestinal diseases caused primarily by two exotoxins, TcdA and TcdB. These toxins enter host cells by binding unique receptors, at least partially via their combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPs) domains. Our study investigated structural determinants necessary for binding and entry of TcdB. Deletion analyses identified TcdB residues 1372-1493 as essential for cytotoxicity in three cell lines. Consistent with this observation, overlapping TcdB fragments (residues 1372-1848, 1372-1493 and 1493-1848) were able to independently bind cells. Our data provide new evidence supporting a more complex model of clostridial glucosylating toxin uptake than previously suggested."
20102225,"Identification of bZIP interaction partners of viral proteins HBZ, MEQ, BZLF1, and K-bZIP using coiled-coil arrays.","Basic-region leucine-zipper transcription factors (bZIPs) contain a segment rich in basic amino acids that can bind DNA, followed by a leucine zipper that can interact with other leucine zippers to form coiled-coil homo- or heterodimers. Several viruses encode proteins containing bZIP domains, including four that encode bZIPs lacking significant homology to any human protein. We investigated the interaction specificity of these four viral bZIPs by using coiled-coil arrays to assess self-associations as well as heterointeractions with 33 representative human bZIPs. The arrays recapitulated reported viral-human interactions and also uncovered new associations. MEQ and HBZ interacted with multiple human partners and had unique interaction profiles compared to any human bZIPs, whereas K-bZIP and BZLF1 displayed homospecificity. New interactions detected included HBZ with MAFB, MAFG, ATF2, CEBPG, and CREBZF and MEQ with NFIL3. These were confirmed in solution using circular dichroism. HBZ can heteroassociate with MAFB and MAFG in the presence of MARE-site DNA, and this interaction is dependent on the basic region of HBZ. NFIL3 and MEQ have different yet overlapping DNA-binding specificities and can form a heterocomplex with DNA. Computational design considering both affinity for MEQ and specificity with respect to other undesired bZIP-type interactions was used to generate a MEQ dimerization inhibitor. This peptide, anti-MEQ, bound MEQ both stably and specifically, as assayed using coiled-coil arrays and circular dichroism in solution. Anti-MEQ also inhibited MEQ binding to DNA. These studies can guide further investigation of the function of viral and human bZIP complexes."
22740689,A Salmonella typhimurium-translocated glycerophospholipid:cholesterol acyltransferase promotes virulence by binding to the RhoA protein switch regions.,"Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium translocates a glycerophospholipid:cholesterol acyltransferase (SseJ) into the host cytosol after its entry into mammalian cells. SseJ is recruited to the cytoplasmic face of the host cell phagosome membrane where it is activated upon binding the small GTPase, RhoA. SseJ is regulated similarly to cognate eukaryotic effectors, as only the GTP-bound form of RhoA family members stimulates enzymatic activity. Using NMR and biochemistry, this work demonstrates that SseJ competes effectively with Rhotekin, ROCK, and PKN1 in binding to a similar RhoA surface. The RhoA surface that binds SseJ includes the regulatory switch regions that control activation of mammalian effectors. These data were used to create RhoA mutants with altered SseJ binding and activation. This structure-function analysis supports a model in which SseJ activation occurs predominantly through binding to residues within switch region II. We further defined the nature of the interaction between SseJ and RhoA by constructing SseJ mutants in the RhoA binding surface. These data indicate that SseJ binding to RhoA is required for recruitment of SseJ to the endosomal network and for full Salmonella virulence for inbred susceptible mice, indicating that regulation of SseJ by small GTPases is an important virulence strategy of this bacterial pathogen. The dependence of a bacterial effector on regulation by a mammalian GTPase defines further how intimately host pathogen interactions have coevolved through similar and divergent evolutionary strategies."
20133640,Identification of an unconventional E3 binding surface on the UbcH5 ~ Ub conjugate recognized by a pathogenic bacterial E3 ligase.,"Gram-negative bacteria deliver a cadre of virulence factors directly into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells to promote pathogenesis and/or commensalism. Recently, families of virulence proteins have been recognized that function as E3 Ubiquitin-ligases. How these bacterial ligases integrate into the ubiquitin (Ub) signaling pathways of the host and how they differ functionally from endogenous eukaryotic E3s is not known. Here we show that the bacterial E3 SspH2 from S. typhimurium selectively binds the human UbcH5 ~ Ub conjugate recognizing regions of both UbcH5 and Ub subunits. The surface of the E2 UbcH5 involved in this interaction differs substantially from that defined for other E2/E3 complexes involving eukaryotic E3-ligases. In vitro, SspH2 directs the synthesis of K48-linked poly-Ub chains, suggesting that cellular protein targets of SspH2-catalyzed Ub transfer are destined for proteasomal destruction. Unexpectedly, we found that intermediates in SspH2-directed reactions are activated poly-Ub chains directly tethered to the UbcH5 active site (UbcH5 ~ Ub(n)). Rapid generation of UbcH5 ~ Ub(n) may allow for bacterially directed modification of eukaryotic target proteins with a completed poly-Ub chain, efficiently tagging host targets for destruction."
24955142,Exploration of panviral proteome: high-throughput cloning and functional implications in virus-host interactions.,"Throughout the long history of virus-host co-evolution, viruses have developed delicate strategies to facilitate their invasion and replication of their genome, while silencing the host immune responses through various mechanisms. The systematic characterization of viral protein-host interactions would yield invaluable information in the understanding of viral invasion/evasion, diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of a viral infection, and mechanisms of host biology. With more than 2,000 viral genomes sequenced, only a small percent of them are well investigated. The access of these viral open reading frames (ORFs) in a flexible cloning format would greatly facilitate both in vitro and in vivo virus-host interaction studies. However, the overall progress of viral ORF cloning has been slow. To facilitate viral studies, we are releasing the initiation of our panviral proteome collection of 2,035 ORF clones from 830 viral genes in the Gateway® recombinational cloning system. Here, we demonstrate several uses of our viral collection including highly efficient production of viral proteins using human cell-free expression system in vitro, global identification of host targets for rubella virus using Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Arrays (NAPPA) containing 10,000 unique human proteins, and detection of host serological responses using micro-fluidic multiplexed immunoassays. The studies presented here begin to elucidate host-viral protein interactions with our systemic utilization of viral ORFs, high-throughput cloning, and proteomic technologies. These valuable plasmid resources will be available to the research community to enable continued viral functional studies."
20534589,Characterization of the membrane-targeting C1 domain in Pasteurella multocida toxin.,"Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) is a virulence factor responsible for the pathogenesis of some forms of pasteurellosis. The toxin activates G(q)- and G(12/13)-dependent pathways through the deamidation of a glutamine residue in the alpha-subunit of heterotrimeric GTPases. We recently reported the crystal structure of the C terminus (residues 575-1285) of PMT (C-PMT), which is composed of three domains (C1, C2, and C3), and that the C1 domain is involved in the localization of C-PMT to the plasma membrane, and the C3 domain possesses a cysteine protease-like catalytic triad. In this study, we analyzed the membrane-targeting function of the C1 domain in detail. The C1 domain consists of seven helices of which the first four (residues 590-670), showing structural similarity to the N terminus of Clostridium difficile toxin B, were found to be involved in the recruitment of C-PMT to the plasma membrane. C-PMT lacking these helices (C-PMT DeltaC1(4H)) neither localized to the plasma membrane nor stimulated the G(q/12/13)-dependent signaling pathways. When the membrane-targeting property was complemented by a peptide tag with an N-myristoylation motif, C-PMT DeltaC1(4H) recovered the PMT activity. Direct binding between the C1 domain and liposomes containing phospholipids was evidenced by surface plasmon resonance analyses. These results indicate that the C1 domain of C-PMT functions as a targeting signal for the plasma membrane."
26638075,A Dynamic Protein Interaction Landscape of the Human Centrosome-Cilium Interface.,"The centrosome is the primary microtubule organizing center of the cells and templates the formation of cilia, thereby operating at a nexus of critical cellular functions. Here, we use proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to map the centrosome-cilium interface; with 58 bait proteins we generate a protein topology network comprising >7,000 interactions. Analysis of interaction profiles coupled with high resolution phenotypic profiling implicates a number of protein modules in centriole duplication, ciliogenesis, and centriolar satellite biogenesis and highlights extensive interplay between these processes. By monitoring dynamic changes in the centrosome-cilium protein interaction landscape during ciliogenesis, we also identify satellite proteins that support cilia formation. Systematic profiling of proximity interactions combined with functional analysis thus provides a rich resource for better understanding human centrosome and cilia biology. Similar strategies may be applied to other complex biological structures or pathways."
15297625,SRC mediates a switch from microtubule- to actin-based motility of vaccinia virus.,"The cascade of events that leads to vaccinia-induced actin polymerization requires Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the viral membrane protein A36R. We found that a localized outside-in signaling cascade induced by the viral membrane protein B5R is required to potently activate Src and induce A36R phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. In addition, Src-mediated phosphorylation of A36R regulated the ability of virus particles to recruit and release conventional kinesin. Thus, Src activity regulates the transition between cytoplasmic microtubule transport and actin-based motility at the plasma membrane."
16352570,Nonstructural protein 3 of bluetongue virus assists virus release by recruiting ESCRT-I protein Tsg101.,"The release of Bluetongue virus (BTV) and other members of the Orbivirus genus from infected host cells occurs predominantly by cell lysis, and in some cases, by budding from the plasma membrane. Two nonstructural proteins, NS3 and NS3A, have been implicated in this process. Here we show that both proteins bind to human Tsg101 and its ortholog from Drosophila melanogaster with similar strengths in vitro. This interaction is mediated by a conserved PSAP motif in NS3 and appears to play a role in virus release. The depletion of Tsg101 with small interfering RNA inhibits the release of BTV and African horse sickness virus, a related orbivirus, from HeLa cells up to fivefold and threefold, respectively. Like most other viral proteins which recruit Tsg101, NS3 also harbors a PPXY late-domain motif that allows NS3 to bind NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligases in vitro. However, the late-domain motifs in NS3 do not function as effectively in facilitating the release of mini Gag virus-like particles from 293T cells as the late domains from human immunodeficiency virus type 1, human T-cell leukemia virus, and Ebola virus. A mutagenesis study showed that the arginine residue in the PPRY motif is responsible for the low activity of the NS3 late-domain motifs. Our data suggest that the BTV late-domain motifs either recruit an antagonist that interferes with budding or fail to recruit an agonist which is different from NEDD4."
15194786,Myxoma virus M11L prevents apoptosis through constitutive interaction with Bak.,"M11L, a 166-amino-acid antiapoptotic protein of myxoma virus, was previously shown to bind to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor by hydrophobic interactions at the outer mitochondrial membrane. Here we demonstrate that an additional property of M11L is the ability to constitutively form inhibitory complexes with the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bak in human cells. This binding interaction was identified by both FLAG-tagged pull-down assays and tandem affinity purification from transfected and virus-infected human cells. M11L binds constitutively to human Bak and, under some inducible conditions, to human Bax as well, but not to the other Bcl-2 family members (Bad, Bid, Bcl-2). When stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, M11L effectively protects these cells from Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, thereby blocking release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase 9, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. We also demonstrate in coexpression studies that M11L can interact with Bak independently of any involvement with Bax. Furthermore, cells stably expressing M11L function to prevent apoptosis that is induced by overexpression of Bak. We conclude that M11L inhibits, in a species-independent fashion, apoptotic signals mediated by activation of Bak."
26651948,"Meta- and Orthogonal Integration of Influenza ""OMICs"" Data Defines a Role for UBR4 in Virus Budding.","Several systems-level datasets designed to dissect host-pathogen interactions during influenza A infection have been reported. However, apparent discordance among these data has hampered their full utility toward advancing mechanistic and therapeutic knowledge. To collectively reconcile these datasets, we performed a meta-analysis of data from eight published RNAi screens and integrated these data with three protein interaction datasets, including one generated within the context of this study. Further integration of these data with global virus-host interaction analyses revealed a functionally validated biochemical landscape of the influenza-host interface, which can be queried through a simplified and customizable web portal (http://www.metascape.org/IAV). Follow-up studies revealed that the putative ubiquitin ligase UBR4 associates with the viral M2 protein and promotes apical transport of viral proteins. Taken together, the integrative analysis of influenza OMICs datasets illuminates a viral-host network of high-confidence human proteins that are essential for influenza A virus replication."
16033967,"Hepatitis C virus NS3 protein interacts with ELKS-{delta} and ELKS-{alpha}, members of a novel protein family involved in intracellular transport and secretory pathways.","The NS3 protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a serine protease activity in its N-terminal region, which plays a crucial role in virus replication. This region has also been reported to interact not only with its viral cofactor NS4A, but also with a number of host-cell proteins, which suggests a multifunctional feature of NS3. By means of yeast two-hybrid screening using an N-terminal region of NS3 as bait, a human cDNA encoding a region of ELKS-delta, a member of a novel family of proteins involved in intracellular transport and secretory pathways, was molecularly cloned. Using co-immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down and confocal and immunoelectron microscopic analyses, it was shown that full-length NS3 interacted physically with full-length ELKS-delta and its splice variant, ELKS-alpha, both in the absence and presence of NS4A, in cultured human cells, including Huh-7 cells harbouring an HCV subgenomic RNA replicon. The degree of binding to ELKS-delta varied with different sequences of the N-terminal 180 residues of NS3. Interestingly, NS3, either full-length or N-terminal fragments, enhanced secretion of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) from the cells, and the increase in SEAP secretion correlated well with the degree of binding between NS3 and ELKS-delta. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that NS3 plays a role in modulating host-cell functions such as intracellular transport and secretion through its binding to ELKS-delta and ELKS-alpha, which may facilitate the virus life cycle and/or mediate the pathogenesis of HCV."
25616068,A combined proteomics/genomics approach links hepatitis C virus infection with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver disease, but insight into virus-host interactions remains limited. We systematically used affinity purification/mass spectrometry to define the host interactions of all ten HCV proteins in hepatoma cells. We combined these studies with RNAi knockdown of corresponding genes using a two-step scoring approach to generate a map of 139 high-confidence HCV-host protein-protein interactions. We found mitochondrial proteins highly involved in HCV infection and characterized an interaction between the viral core protein and host protein within bgcn homolog (WIBG). Expression of core prevents WIBG from binding its regular interaction partners Y14 and Magoh, two known mediators of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. We discovered that this surveillance pathway is disrupted in HCV-infected cells, causing potentially harmful transcripts to accumulate. Our study provides a comprehensive view of HCV-host interactions and uncovers mechanisms for how HCV perturbs host functions during infection."
19966800,Helicobacter pylori CagA inhibits PAR1-MARK family kinases by mimicking host substrates.,"The CagA protein of Helicobacter pylori interacts with numerous cellular factors and is associated with increased virulence and risk of gastric carcinoma. We present here the cocrystal structure of a subdomain of CagA with the human kinase PAR1b/MARK2, revealing that a CagA peptide mimics substrates of this kinase family, resembling eukaryotic protein kinase inhibitors. Mutagenesis of conserved residues central to this interaction renders CagA inactive as an inhibitor of MARK2."
26567527,Involvement of FKBP6 in hepatitis C virus replication.,"The chaperone system is known to be exploited by viruses for their replication. In the present study, we identified the cochaperone FKBP6 as a host factor required for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. FKBP6 is a peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase with three domains of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), but lacks FK-506 binding ability. FKBP6 interacted with HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) and also formed a complex with FKBP6 itself or FKBP8, which is known to be critical for HCV replication. The Val(121) of NS5A and TPR domains of FKBP6 were responsible for the interaction between NS5A and FKBP6. FKBP6 was colocalized with NS5A, FKBP8, and double-stranded RNA in HCV-infected cells. HCV replication was completely suppressed in FKBP6-knockout hepatoma cell lines, while the expression of FKBP6 restored HCV replication in FKBP6-knockout cells. A treatment with the FKBP8 inhibitor N-(N', N'-dimethylcarboxamidomethyl)cycloheximide impaired the formation of a homo- or hetero-complex consisting of FKBP6 and/or FKBP8, and suppressed HCV replication. HCV infection promoted the expression of FKBP6, but not that of FKBP8, in cultured cells and human liver tissue. These results indicate that FKBP6 is an HCV-induced host factor that supports viral replication in cooperation with NS5A."
10187771,"Equine herpesvirus-2 E10 gene product, but not its cellular homologue, activates NF-kappaB transcription factor and c-Jun N-terminal kinase.","We have previously reported on the death effector domain containing E8 gene product from equine herpesvirus-2, designated FLICE inhibitory protein (v-FLIP), and on its cellular homologue, c-FLIP, which inhibit the activation of caspase-8 by death receptors. Here we report on the structure and function of the E10 gene product of equine herpesvirus-2, designated v-CARMEN, and on its cellular homologue, c-CARMEN, which contain a caspase-recruiting domain (CARD) motif. c-CARMEN is highly homologous to the viral protein in its N-terminal CARD motif but differs in its C-terminal extension. v-CARMEN and c-CARMEN interact directly in a CARD-dependent manner yet reveal different binding specificities toward members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family. v-CARMEN binds to TRAF6 and weakly to TRAF3 and, upon overexpression, potently induces the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcriptional pathways. c-CARMEN or truncated versions thereof do not appear to induce JNK and NF-kappaB activation by themselves, nor do they affect the JNK and NF-kappaB activating potential of v-CARMEN. Thus, in contrast to the cellular homologue, v-CARMEN may have additional properties in its unique C terminus that allow for an autonomous activator effect on NF-kappaB and JNK. Through activation of NF-kappaB, v-CARMEN may regulate the expression of the cellular and viral genes important for viral replication."
26808496,Comparative Proteomics Reveals Important Viral-Host Interactions in HCV-Infected Human Liver Cells.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) poses a global threat to public health. HCV envelop protein E2 is the major component on the virus envelope, which plays an important role in virus entry and morphogenesis. Here, for the first time, we affinity purified E2 complex formed in HCV-infected human hepatoma cells and conducted comparative mass spectrometric analyses. 85 cellular proteins and three viral proteins were successfully identified in three independent trials, among which alphafetoprotein (AFP), UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGT1) and HCV NS4B were further validated as novel E2 binding partners. Subsequent functional characterization demonstrated that gene silencing of UGT1 in human hepatoma cell line Huh7.5.1 markedly decreased the production of infectious HCV, indicating a regulatory role of UGT1 in viral lifecycle. Domain mapping experiments showed that HCV E2-NS4B interaction requires the transmembrane domains of the two proteins. Altogether, our proteomics study has uncovered key viral and cellular factors that interact with E2 and provided new insights into our understanding of HCV infection."
26627825,Extracellular Fibrinogen-binding Protein (Efb) from Staphylococcus aureus Inhibits the Formation of Platelet-Leukocyte Complexes.,"Extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb) from Staphylococcus aureus inhibits platelet activation, although its mechanism of action has not been established. In this study, we discovered that the N-terminal region of Efb (Efb-N) promotes platelet binding of fibrinogen and that Efb-N binding to platelets proceeds via two independent mechanisms: fibrinogen-mediated and fibrinogen-independent. By proteomic analysis of Efb-interacting proteins within platelets and confirmation by pulldown assays followed by immunoblotting, we identified P-selectin and multimerin-1 as novel Efb interaction partners. The interaction of both P-selectin and multimerin-1 with Efb is independent of fibrinogen. We focused on Efb interaction with P-selectin. Excess of P-selectin extracellular domain significantly impaired Efb binding by activated platelets, suggesting that P-selectin is the main receptor for Efb on the surface of activated platelets. Efb-N interaction with P-selectin inhibited P-selectin binding to its physiological ligand, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), both in cell lysates and in cell-free assays. Because of the importance of P-selectin-PSGL-1 binding in the interaction between platelets and leukocytes, we tested human whole blood and found that Efb abolishes the formation of platelet-monocyte and platelet-granulocyte complexes. In summary, we present evidence that in addition to its documented antithrombotic activity, Efb can play an immunoregulatory role via inhibition of P-selectin-PSGL-1-dependent formation of platelet-leukocyte complexes."
14644612,Direct interaction of TFIIB and the IE protein of equine herpesvirus 1 is required for maximal trans-activation function.,"Recently, we reported that the immediate-early (IE) protein of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) associates with transcription factor TFIIB [J. Virol. 75 (2001), 10219]. In the current study, the IE protein purified as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was shown to interact directly with purified TFIIB in GST-pulldown assays. A panel of TFIIB mutants employed in protein-binding assays revealed that residues 125 to 174 within the first direct repeat of TFIIB mediate its interaction with the IE protein. This interaction is physiologically relevant as transient transfection assays demonstrated that (1). exogenous native TFIIB did not perturb IE protein function, and (2). ectopic expression of a TFIIB mutant that lacked the IE protein interactive domain significantly diminished the ability of the IE protein to trans-activate EHV-1 promoters. These results suggest that an interaction of the IE protein with TFIIB is an important aspect of the regulatory role of the IE protein in the trans-activation of EHV-1 promoters."
7483825,gp13 (EHV-gC): a complement receptor induced by equine herpesviruses.,"Equine herpesviruses type 1 (EHV-1) and type 4 (EHV-4) induce a complement receptor protein on the surface of infected cells capable of binding to the third component of complement (C3). The protein mediating the binding to the C3 component of complement was identified as glycoprotein 13 (gp13, EHV-gC), as expression of the cloned viral gene under the control of a CMV promoter induced C3 binding activity at the transfected cell surface. Comparable to glycoprotein C (gC) from herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1-gC), glycoprotein III from pseudorabiesvirus (gIII, PRV-gC) and bovine herpesvirus-1 (gIII, BHV-1-gC), gp13 derived from EHV-infected cell lysates bound to C3 fixed to solid phase, showing preferential binding to the appropriate host complement component. Similar to wild-type isolates, a highly attenuated vaccine EHV-1 strain also displayed complement receptor activity despite apparent differences of the gp13 gene in restriction enzyme digest pattern and reactivity with monoclonal antibodies. In addition, other structural proteins were altered in the vaccine strain as compared to wild-type strains, which might contribute to its attenuated phenotype. In contrast to the situation observed with HSV-1-gC, the interaction of gp13 (EHV-gC) with horse complement was not inhibited by polyanionic substances like heparin or dextran sulfate. These results suggest structural differences in the particular binding mechanism of the respective viral envelope proteins."
11277703,"Porcine HveC, a member of the highly conserved HveC/nectin 1 family, is a functional alphaherpesvirus receptor.","Human herpesvirus entry mediator C (HveC) is an alphaherpesvirus receptor which binds to virion glycoprotein D (gD). We identified porcine HveC and studied its interaction with pseudorabies virus (PrV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) gD. Porcine and human HveC have 96% amino acid identity and HveC from African green monkey, mouse, hamster, and cow are similarly conserved. Porcine HveC mediates entry of HSV-1, HSV-2, PrV, and bovine herpesvirus type 1. Truncated soluble forms of HSV-1 and PrV gD bind competitively to porcine HveC. Biosensor analysis shows that PrV gD binds with a 10-fold higher affinity than HSV-1 gD. Monoclonal antibodies against human HveC recognize the porcine homologue and can block gD binding and entry of HSV-1 and PrV. Porcine HveC is functionally indistinguishable from human HveC. Our results are consistent with the suggestion that HveC is a pan-alphaherpesvirus receptor that interacts with a conserved structural domain of gD."
23937259,Identification of protein phosphatase 1 as a regulator of the LRRK2 phosphorylation cycle.,"A cluster of phosphorylation sites in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), including Ser910, Ser935, Ser955 and Ser973, is important for PD (Parkinson's disease) pathogenesis as several PD-linked LRRK2 mutants are dephosphorylated at these sites. LRRK2 is also dephosphorylated in cells after pharmacological inhibition of its kinase activity, which is currently proposed as a strategy for disease-modifying PD therapy. Despite this importance of LRRK2 dephosphorylation in mutant LRRK2 pathological mechanism(s) and in LRRK2's response to inhibition, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Therefore we aimed to identify the phosphatase for LRRK2. Using a panel of recombinant phosphatases, we found that PP1 (protein phosphatase 1) efficiently dephosphorylates LRRK2 in vitro. PP1 activity on LRRK2 dephosphorylation was confirmed in cells using PP1 inhibition to reverse LRRK2 dephosphorylation induced by the potent LRRK2 kinase inhibitor LRRK2-IN1 as well as in R1441G mutant LRRK2. We also found that PP1 and LRRK2 can form a complex in cells. Furthermore, we observed that PP1 inhibition modulates LRRK2's cellular phenotype by reducing skein-like LRRK2-positive structures associated with dephosphorylation. In conclusion, the present study reveals PP1 as the physiological LRRK2 phosphatase, responsible for LRRK2 dephosphorylation observed in PD mutant LRRK2 and after LRRK2 kinase inhibition."
24169621,Elucidating novel hepatitis C virus-host interactions using combined mass spectrometry and functional genomics approaches.,"More than 170 million people worldwide are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), for which future therapies are expected to rely upon a combination of oral antivirals. For a rapidly evolving virus like HCV, host-targeting antivirals are an attractive option. To decipher the role of novel HCV-host interactions, we used a proteomics approach combining immunoprecipitation of viral-host protein complexes coupled to mass spectrometry identification and functional genomics RNA interference screening of HCV partners. Here, we report the proteomics analyses of protein complexes associated with Core, NS2, NS3/4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins. We identified a stringent set of 98 human proteins interacting specifically with one of the viral proteins. The overlap with previous virus-host interaction studies demonstrates 24.5% shared HCV interactors overall (24/98), illustrating the reliability of the approach. The identified human proteins show enriched Gene Ontology terms associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, transport proteins with a major contribution of NS3/4A interactors, and transmembrane proteins for Core interactors. The interaction network emphasizes a high degree distribution, a high betweenness distribution, and high interconnectivity of targeted human proteins, in agreement with previous virus-host interactome studies. The set of HCV interactors also shows extensive enrichment for known targets of other viruses. The combined proteomic and gene silencing study revealed strong enrichment in modulators of HCV RNA replication, with the identification of 11 novel cofactors among our set of specific HCV partners. Finally, we report a novel immune evasion mechanism of NS3/4A protein based on its ability to affect nucleocytoplasmic transport of type I interferon-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 nuclear translocation. The study revealed highly stringent association between HCV interactors and their functional contribution to the viral replication cycle and pathogenesis."
26829648,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis AtsG (Rv0296c), GlmU (Rv1018c) and SahH (Rv3248c) Proteins Function as the Human IL-8-Binding Effectors and Contribute to Pathogen Entry into Human Neutrophils.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an extremely successful intracellular pathogen that has evolved a broad spectrum of pathogenic mechanisms that enable its manipulation of host defense elements and its survival in the hostile environment inside phagocytes. Cellular influx into the site of mycobacterial entry is mediated by a variety of chemokines, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), and the innate cytokine network is critical for the development of an adaptive immune response and infection control. Using affinity chromatography, liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance techniques, we identified M. tuberculosis AtsG arylsulphatase, bifunctional glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase and N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GlmU) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SahH) as the pathogen proteins that bind to human IL-8. The interactions of all of the identified proteins (AtsG, GlmU and SahH) with IL-8 were characterized by high binding affinity with KD values of 6.83x10-6 M, 5.24x10-6 M and 7.14x10-10 M, respectively. Furthermore, the construction of Mtb mutant strains overproducing AtsG, GlmU or SahH allowed determination of the contribution of these proteins to mycobacterial entry into human neutrophils. The significantly increased number of intracellularly located bacilli of the overproducing M. tuberculosis mutant strains compared with those of ""wild-type"" M. tuberculosis and the binding interaction of AtsG, GlmU and SahH proteins with human IL-8 may indicate that these proteins participate in the modulation of the early events of infection with tubercle bacilli and could affect pathogen attachment to target cells."
26867650,TGF-β triggers HBV cccDNA degradation through AID-dependent deamination.,"The covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a viral center molecule for HBV infection and persistence. However, the cellular restriction factors of HBV cccDNA are not well understood. Here, we show that TGF-β can induce nuclear viral cccDNA degradation and hypermutation via activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deamination activity in hepatocytes. This suppression by TGF-β is abrogated when AID or the activity of uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) is absent, which indicates that AID deamination and the UNG-mediated excision of uracil act in concert to degrade viral cccDNA. Moreover, the HBV core protein promotes the interaction between AID and viral cccDNA. Overall, our results indicate a novel molecular mechanism that allows cytokine TGF-β to restrict viral nuclear cccDNA in innate immunity, thereby suggesting a novel method for potentially eliminating cccDNA."
11238466,"Equine herpesvirus protein E10 induces membrane recruitment and phosphorylation of its cellular homologue, bcl-10.","v-E10, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing gene product of equine herpesvirus 2, is the viral homologue of the bcl-10 protein whose gene was found to be translocated in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. v-E10 efficiently activates the c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 stress kinase, and the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcriptional pathway and interacts with its cellular homologue, bcl-10, via a CARD-mediated interaction. Here we demonstrate that v-E10 contains a COOH-terminal geranylgeranylation consensus site which is responsible for its plasma membrane localization. Expression of v-E10 induces hyperphosphorylation and redistribution of bcl-10 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, a process which is dependent on the intactness of the v-E10 CARD motif. Both membrane localization and a functional CARD motif are important for v-E10-mediated NF-kappaB induction, but not for JNK activation, which instead requires a functional v-E10 binding site for tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6. Moreover, v-E10-induced NF-kappaB activation is inhibited by a dominant negative version of the bcl-10 binding protein TRAF1, suggesting that v-E10-induced membrane recruitment of cellular bcl-10 induces constitutive TRAF-mediated NF-kappaB activation."
25854864,Interaction between human BAP31 and respiratory syncytial virus small hydrophobic (SH) protein.,"The small hydrophobic (SH) protein is a short channel-forming polypeptide encoded by the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV). Deletion of SH protein leads to the viral attenuation in mice and primates, and delayed apoptosis in infected cells. We have used a membrane-based yeast two-hybrid system (MbY2H) and a library from human lung cDNA to detect proteins that bind SH protein. This led to the identification of a membrane protein, B-cell associated protein 31 (BAP31). Transfected SH protein co-localizes with transfected BAP31 in cells, and pulls down endogenous BAP31. Titration of purified C-terminal endodomain of BAP31 against isotopically labeled SH protein in detergent micelles suggests direct interaction between the two proteins. Given the key role of BAP31 in protein trafficking and its critical involvement in pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways, this novel interaction may constitute a potential drug target."
18216108,A single-amino-acid mutation in hepatitis C virus NS5A disrupting FKBP8 interaction impairs viral replication.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) regulates viral replication through its interaction with host and other viral proteins. We have previously shown that FK506-binding protein 8 (FKBP8) binds to NS5A and recruits Hsp90 to form a complex that participates in the replication of HCV. In this study, we examined the biochemical characteristics of the interaction and the intracellular localization of NS5A and FKBP8. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the dissociation constant of the interaction between the purified FKBP8 and NS5A expressed in bacteria was 82 nM. Mutational analyses of NS5A revealed that a single amino acid residue of Val or Ile at position 121, which is well conserved among all genotypes of HCV, is critical for the specific interaction with FKBP8. Substitution of the Val(121) to Ala drastically impaired the replication of HCV replicon cells, and the drug-resistant replicon cells emerging after drug selection were shown to have reverted to the original arrangement by replacing Ala(121) with Val. Examination of individual fields of the replicon cells by both fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy (the correlative fluorescence microscopy-electron microscopy technique) revealed that FKBP8 is partially colocalized with NS5A in the cytoplasmic structure known as the membranous web. These results suggest that specific interaction of NS5A with FKBP8 in the cytoplasmic compartment plays a crucial role in the replication of HCV."
26559832,Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 Mediate Species-Specific Modulations of Programmed Necrosis through the Viral Ribonucleotide Reductase Large Subunit R1.,"Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3) and its substrate mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) are core regulators of programmed necrosis. The elimination of pathogen-infected cells by programmed necrosis acts as an important host defense mechanism. Here, we report that human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 had opposite impacts on programmed necrosis in human cells versus their impacts in mouse cells. Similar to HSV-1, HSV-2 infection triggered programmed necrosis in mouse cells. However, neither HSV-1 nor HSV-2 infection was able to induce programmed necrosis in human cells. Moreover, HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection in human cells blocked tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced necrosis by preventing the induction of an RIP1/RIP3 necrosome. The HSV ribonucleotide reductase large subunit R1 was sufficient to suppress TNF-induced necrosis, and its RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domain was required to disrupt the RIP1/RIP3 complex in human cells. Therefore, this study provides evidence that HSV has likely evolved strategies to evade the host defense mechanism of programmed necrosis in human cells."
25556234,New host factors important for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication revealed by a novel microfluidics screen for interactors of matrix (M) protein.,"Although human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and elderly worldwide, there is no licensed RSV vaccine or effective drug treatment available. The RSV Matrix protein plays key roles in virus life cycle, being found in the nucleus early in infection in a transcriptional inhibitory role, and later localizing in viral inclusion bodies before coordinating viral assembly and budding at the plasma membrane. In this study, we used a novel, high throughput microfluidics platform and custom human open reading frame library to identify novel host cell binding partners of RSV matrix. Novel interactors identified included proteins involved in host transcription regulation, the innate immunity response, cytoskeletal regulation, membrane remodeling, and cellular trafficking. A number of these interactions were confirmed by immunoprecipitation and cellular colocalization approaches. Importantly, the physiological significance of matrix interaction with the actin-binding protein cofilin 1, caveolae protein Caveolin 2, and the zinc finger protein ZNF502 was confirmed. siRNA knockdown of the host protein levels resulted in reduced RSV virus production in infected cells. These results have important implications for future antiviral strategies aimed at targets of RSV matrix in the host cell."
27018634,Quantitative Mass Spectrometry Identifies Novel Host Binding Partners for Pathogenic Escherichia coli Type III Secretion System Effectors.,"Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli cause enteric diseases resulting in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. These pathogens remain extracellular and translocate a set of type III secreted effector proteins into host cells to promote bacterial virulence. Effectors manipulate host cell pathways to facilitate infection by interacting with a variety of host targets, yet the binding partners and mechanism of action of many effectors remain elusive. We performed a mass spectrometry screen to identify host targets for a library of effectors. We found five known effector targets and discovered four novel interactions. Interestingly, we identified multiple effectors that interacted with the microtubule associated protein, ensconsin. Using co-immunoprecipitations, we confirmed that NleB1 and EspL interacted with ensconsin in a region that corresponded to its microtubule binding domain. Ensconsin is an essential cofactor of kinesin-1 that is required for intracellular trafficking, and we demonstrated that intracellular trafficking was severely disrupted during wild type EPEC infections but not during infections with ΔnleB1 or ΔespL mutants. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of quantitative proteomics for identifying effector-host protein interactions and suggest that vesicular trafficking is a crucial cellular process that may be targeted by NleB1 and EspL through their interaction with ensconsin."
20374249,The pathogenic E. coli type III effector EspZ interacts with host CD98 and facilitates host cell prosurvival signalling.,"Enterohaemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EHEC and EPEC respectively) are diarrhoeal pathogens that cause the formation of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions on infected host cells. These pathogens encode a type III secretion system (T3SS) used to inject effector proteins directly into host cells, an essential requirement for virulence. In this study, we identified a function for the type III secreted effector EspZ. Infection with EPEC DeltaespZ caused increased cytotoxicity in HeLa and MDCK cells compared with wild-type EPEC, and expressing espZ in cells abrogated this effect. Using yeast two-hybrid, proteomics, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation, it was demonstrated that EspZ interacts with the host protein CD98, which contributes to protection against EPEC-mediated cytotoxicity. EspZ enhanced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and AKT during infection with EPEC, but CD98 only appeared to facilitate FAK phosphorylation. This study provides evidence that EspZ and CD98 promote host cell survival mechanisms involving FAK during A/E pathogen infection."
21947777,The type III system-secreted effector EspZ localizes to host mitochondria and interacts with the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 17b.,"Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC, respectively) are attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens that cause severe diarrheal disease worldwide. To cause disease, A/E pathogens require a type III secretion system, which facilitates transport of bacterial effector proteins directly into infected host cells. One of these effector proteins translocated by the type III secretion system, EspZ, is essential for A/E pathogen infection and functions to prevent rapid death of EPEC-infected cells. We further investigated the mechanism of EspZ-mediated protection of infected host cells and found that a severe decrease in host mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ(m)) occurs concurrently with host cell lysis during infection with EPEC lacking EspZ (ΔespZ). It was also demonstrated that EspZ localizes to host cell mitochondria and interacts with the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 17b (TIM17b). In addition, host cell cytotoxicity was exacerbated in the absence of TIM17b during wild-type (WT) EPEC infection. The findings of this study together provide the first evidence that EspZ localizes to host mitochondria and that TIM17b contributes to protection against rapid cell death during EPEC infection."
20631090,The classical swine fever virus N-terminal protease N(pro) binds to cellular HAX-1.,"The positive-stranded RNA genome of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) encodes 12 known proteins. The first protein to be translated is the N-terminal protease (N(pro)). N(pro) helps evade the innate interferon response by targeting interferon regulatory factor-3 for proteasomal degradation and also participates in the evasion of dsRNA-induced apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanisms by which N(pro) functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen in which the anti-apoptotic protein HAX-1 was identified. The N(pro)-HAX-1 interaction was confirmed using co-precipitation assays. A dramatic redistribution of both N(pro) and HAX-1 was observed in co-transfected cells, as well as in transfected cells infected with wild-type CSFV, but not in cells infected with an N(pro)-deleted CSFV strain."
12941884,Identification of a novel cellular transcriptional repressor interacting with the latent nuclear antigen of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.,"The latent nuclear antigen (LNA) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has an essential role in viral latent infection. LNA maintains the stability of KSHV episomes and modulates the expression of cellular genes. A novel cellular protein KLIP1 was identified to interact with LNA through yeast two-hybrid screening, and confirmed by a glutathione S-transferase pull down assay. Domain mapping showed that KLIP1 interacted with the N-terminal domain of LNA. Northern blot hybridization with a KLIP1 probe identified a major transcript of 1.8 kb and a minor transcript of 2.8 kb. cDNA library screening and 5'-RACE revealed that the major transcript encoded an open-reading-frame of 1,257 bp and had a 5'-untranslated region of 73 nucleotides. The major KLIP1 transcript was ubiquitously present in different cell types examined. A KLIP1 synthetic peptide antibody detected a doublet of 58-kDa and 63-kDa proteins in a Western blot assay. KLIP1 had two putative nuclear localization signals and showed punctate nuclear localization when expressed as a GFP-fusion protein. KLIP1 interacted with LNA in vivo, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation using KSHV-infected cells and colocalization when they were expressed as GFP- and DsRed-fusion proteins, respectively. Consistent with its interaction with LNA, nuclear localization, and possession of two leucine zipper motifs, KLIP1 behaved like a transcriptional factor and repressed herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter activity in a mammalian one-hybrid assay. In addition, cotransfection with LNA alleviated the transcriptional repression effect of KLIP1 on TK promoter activity. These results suggest that KLIP1 is a new member of cellular transcriptional repressors, and that LNA is involved in deregulating cellular transcription process."
16500691,Association of RON tyrosine kinase with the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus envelope glycoprotein.,"The envelope (Env) of Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) functions as an oncoprotein. One of the mechanisms of JSRV-induced cell transformation that has been proposed for epithelial cells involves JSRV Env binding Hyaluronidase 2 (the JSRV receptor), thereby inducing its degradation and allowing the release and activation of RON tyrosine kinase which is normally suppressed by HYAL-2. In this study, we report that HYAL-2 and RON are not critical for the JSRV Env-induced transformation of the rat epithelial cell line IEC-18, while the cytoplasmic tail of the JSRV Env is critical to transform this cell line. We have also determined that RON can associate with the JSRV Env under normal and stringent conditions. In addition, the cytoplasmic tail of the JSRV and the enJS5F16 (non oncogenic JSRV-related endogenous retrovirus) Env proteins appears to have a major influence on the activation status of RON. Thus, it appears that the interaction of the JSRV Env with RON is more complex than previously thought and requires further investigation."
24550280,Large-scale interaction profiling of PDZ domains through proteomic peptide-phage display using human and viral phage peptidomes.,"The human proteome contains a plethora of short linear motifs (SLiMs) that serve as binding interfaces for modular protein domains. Such interactions are crucial for signaling and other cellular processes, but are difficult to detect because of their low to moderate affinities. Here we developed a dedicated approach, proteomic peptide-phage display (ProP-PD), to identify domain-SLiM interactions. Specifically, we generated phage libraries containing all human and viral C-terminal peptides using custom oligonucleotide microarrays. With these libraries we screened the nine PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains of human Densin-180, Erbin, Scribble, and Disks large homolog 1 for peptide ligands. We identified several known and putative interactions potentially relevant to cellular signaling pathways and confirmed interactions between full-length Scribble and the target proteins β-PIX, plakophilin-4, and guanylate cyclase soluble subunit α-2 using colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The affinities of recombinant Scribble PDZ domains and the synthetic peptides representing the C termini of these proteins were in the 1- to 40-μM range. Furthermore, we identified several well-established host-virus protein-protein interactions, and confirmed that PDZ domains of Scribble interact with the C terminus of Tax-1 of human T-cell leukemia virus with micromolar affinity. Previously unknown putative viral protein ligands for the PDZ domains of Scribble and Erbin were also identified. Thus, we demonstrate that our ProP-PD libraries are useful tools for probing PDZ domain interactions. The method can be extended to interrogate all potential eukaryotic, bacterial, and viral SLiMs and we suggest it will be a highly valuable approach for studying cellular and pathogen-host protein-protein interactions."
11145900,"The equine herpesvirus 1 immediate-early protein interacts with EAP, a nucleolar-ribosomal protein.","The equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) immediate-early (IE) phosphoprotein is essential for the activation of transcription from viral early and late promoters and regulates transcription from its own promoter. The IE protein of 1487 amino acids contains a serine-rich tract (SRT) between residues 181 and 220. Deletion of the SRT decreased transactivation activity of the IE protein. Previous results from investigation of the ICP4 protein, the IE homolog of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), revealed that a domain containing a serine-rich tract interacts with EAP (Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small nuclear RNA-associated protein), a 15-kDa nucleolar-ribosomal protein (R. Leopardi, and B. Roizman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93, 4572-4576, 1996). DNA binding assays revealed that (i) glutathione S-transferase (GST)-EAP disrupted the binding of HSV-1 ICP4 to its cognate DNA in a dose-dependent manner, (ii) GST-EAP interacted with the EHV-1 IE protein, but did not disrupt its binding to its cognate site in viral DNA. GST-pulldown assays indicated that the SRT of the IE protein is required for physical interaction with EAP. The IE protein and EAP colocalized in the cytoplasm of the infected equine ETCC cells at late times of the infection cycle. This latter finding may be important in EHV-1 gene regulation since late viral gene expression is greatly influenced by the EICP0 trans-activator protein whose function is antagonized by the IE protein."
16641295,The unique IR2 protein of equine herpesvirus 1 negatively regulates viral gene expression.,"The IR2 protein (IR2P) is a truncated form of the immediate-early protein (IEP) lacking the essential acidic transcriptional activation domain (TAD) and serine-rich tract and yet retaining binding domains for DNA and TFIIB and nuclear localization signal (NLS). Analysis of the IR2 promoter indicated that the IR2 promoter was upregulated by the EICP0P. The IR2P was first detected in the nucleus at 5 h postinfection in equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1)-infected HeLa and equine NBL6 cells. Transient-transfection assays revealed that (i) the IR2P by itself downregulated EHV-1 early promoters (EICP0, TK, EICP22, and EICP27) in a dose-dependent manner; (ii) the IR2P abrogated the IEP and the EICP27P (UL5) mediated transactivation of viral promoters in a dose-dependent manner; and (iii) the IR2P, like the IEP itself, also downregulated the IE promoter, indicating that the IEP TAD is not necessary to downregulate the IE promoter. In vitro interaction assays revealed that the IR2P interacts with TATA box-binding protein (TBP). The essential domain(s) of the IR2P that mediate negative regulation were mapped to amino acid residues 1 to 706, indicating that the DNA-binding domain and the NLS of the IR2P may be important for the downregulation. In transient-transfection and virus growth assays, the IR2P reduced EHV-1 production by 23-fold compared to virus titers achieved in cells transfected with the empty vector. Overall, these studies suggest that the IR2P downregulates viral gene expression by acting as a dominant-negative protein that blocks IEP-binding to viral promoters and/or squelching the limited supplies of TFIIB and TBP."
14581554,Colocalization and interaction of the porcine arterivirus nucleocapsid protein with the small nucleolar RNA-associated protein fibrillarin.,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells, but its nucleocapsid (N) protein localizes specifically to the nucleus and nucleolus. The mechanism of nuclear translocation and whether N associates with particular nucleolar components are unknown. In the present study, we show by confocal microscopy that the PRRSV N protein colocalizes with the small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)-associated protein fibrillarin. Direct and specific interaction of N with fibrillarin was demonstrated in vivo by the mammalian two-hybrid assay in cells cotransfected with the N and fibrillarin genes and in vitro by the glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay using the expressed fibrillarin protein. Using a series of deletion mutants, the interactive domain of N with fibrillarin was mapped to a region of amino acids 30 to 37. For fibrillarin, the first 80 amino acids, which contain the glycine-arginine-rich region (the GAR domain), was determined to be the domain interactive with N. The N protein was able to bind to the full-length genomic RNA of PRRSV, and the RNA binding domain was identified as the region overlapping with the nuclear localization signal situated at positions 41 to 47. These results suggest that the N protein nuclear transport may be controlled by the binding of RNA to N. The PRRSV N protein was also able to bind to both 28S and 18S ribosomal RNAs. The protein-protein interaction between N and fibrillarin was RNA dependent but independent of N protein phosphorylation. Taken together, our studies demonstrate a specific interaction of the PRRSV nucleocapsid protein with the host cell protein fibrillarin in the nucleolus, and they imply a potential linkage of viral strategies for the modulation of host cell functions, possibly through rRNA precursor processing and ribosome biogenesis."
28228557,Surfactant Protein A Inhibits Growth and Adherence of Uropathogenic ,"Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a multifunctional host defense collectin that was first identified as a component of pulmonary surfactant. Although SP-A is also expressed in various tissues, including the urinary tract, its innate immune functions in nonpulmonary tissues are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that adherence of uropathogenic "
28169297,Comparative influenza protein interactomes identify the role of plakophilin 2 in virus restriction.,"Cellular protein interaction networks are integral to host defence and immune signalling pathways, which are often hijacked by viruses via protein interactions. However, the comparative virus-host protein interaction networks and how these networks control host immunity and viral infection remain to be elucidated. Here, we mapped protein interactomes between human host and several influenza A viruses (IAV). Comparative analyses of the interactomes identified common and unique interaction patterns regulating innate immunity and viral infection. Functional screening of the 'core' interactome consisting of common interactions identified five novel host factors regulating viral infection. Plakophilin 2 (PKP2), an influenza PB1-interacting protein, restricts IAV replication and competes with PB2 for PB1 binding. The binding competition leads to perturbation of the IAV polymerase complex, thereby limiting polymerase activity and subsequent viral replication. Taken together, comparative analyses of the influenza-host protein interactomes identified PKP2 as a natural inhibitor of IAV polymerase complex."
22593156,The interactome of the human respiratory syncytial virus NS1 protein highlights multiple effects on host cell biology.,"Viral proteins can have multiple effects on host cell biology. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a good example of this. During the virus life cycle, NS1 can act as an antagonist of host type I and III interferon production and signaling, inhibit apoptosis, suppress dendritic cell maturation, control protein stability, and regulate transcription of host cell mRNAs, among other functions. It is likely that NS1 performs these different roles through interactions with multiple host cell proteins. To investigate this and identify cellular proteins that could interact with NS1, we used quantitative proteomics in combination with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-trap immunoprecipitation and bioinformatic analysis. This analysis identified 221 proteins that were potentially part of complexes that could interact with NS1, with many of these associated with transcriptional regulation as part of the mediator complex, cell cycle regulation, and other functions previously assigned to NS1. Specific immunoprecipitation using the GFP trap was used to confirm the ability of selected cellular proteins to interact individually with NS1. Infection of A549 cells with recombinant viruses deficient in the expression of NS1 and overexpression analysis both demonstrated that NS1 was necessary and sufficient for the enrichment of cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle."
21957124,Viperin inhibits hepatitis C virus replication by interfering with binding of NS5A to host protein hVAP-33.,"Viperin is a type-I and -II interferon-inducible intracytoplasmic protein that mediates antiviral activity against several viruses. A previous study has reported that viperin could limit hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in vitro. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we found that overexpression of viperin could inhibit HCV replication in a dose-dependent manner in both the replicon and HCVcc systems. Furthermore, through co-immunoprecipitation and laser confocal microscopic analysis, viperin was found to interact with the host protein hVAP-33. Mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that the anti-HCV activity of viperin was located to its C terminus, which was required for the interaction with the C-terminal domain of hVAP-33. Competitive co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that viperin could interact competitively with hVAP-33, and could therefore interfere with its interactions with HCV NS5A. In summary, these findings suggest a novel mechanism by which viperin inhibits HCV replication, possibly through binding to host protein hVAP-33 and interfering with its interaction with NS5A."
26439010,TAPBPR alters MHC class I peptide presentation by functioning as a peptide exchange catalyst.,"Our understanding of the antigen presentation pathway has recently been enhanced with the identification that the tapasin-related protein TAPBPR is a second major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-specific chaperone. We sought to determine whether, like tapasin, TAPBPR can also influence MHC class I peptide selection by functioning as a peptide exchange catalyst. We show that TAPBPR can catalyse the dissociation of peptides from peptide-MHC I complexes, enhance the loading of peptide-receptive MHC I molecules, and discriminate between peptides based on affinity in vitro. In cells, the depletion of TAPBPR increased the diversity of peptides presented on MHC I molecules, suggesting that TAPBPR is involved in restricting peptide presentation. Our results suggest TAPBPR binds to MHC I in a peptide-receptive state and, like tapasin, works to enhance peptide optimisation. It is now clear there are two MHC class I specific peptide editors, tapasin and TAPBPR, intimately involved in controlling peptide presentation to the immune system."
25740999,Peptide-Dependent Recognition of HLA-B*57:01 by KIR3DS1.,"Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) play an important role in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells, which in turn contribute to the effective immune control of many viral infections. In the context of HIV infection, the closely related KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1 molecules, in particular, have been associated with disease outcome. Inhibitory signals via KIR3DL1 are disrupted by downregulation of HLA class I ligands on the infected cell surface and can also be impacted by changes in the presented peptide repertoire. In contrast, the activatory ligands for KIR3DS1 remain obscure. We used a structure-driven approach to define the characteristics of HLA class I-restricted peptides that interact with KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1. In the case of HLA-B*57:01, we used this knowledge to identify bona fide HIV-derived peptide epitopes with similar properties. Two such peptides facilitated productive interactions between HLA-B*57:01 and KIR3DS1. These data reveal the presence of KIR3DS1 ligands within the HIV-specific peptide repertoire presented by a protective HLA class I allotype, thereby enhancing our mechanistic understanding of the processes that enable NK cells to impact disease outcome."
22045669,The antiviral protein viperin inhibits hepatitis C virus replication via interaction with nonstructural protein 5A.,"The interferon-stimulated gene, viperin, has been shown to have antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the context of the HCV replicon, although the molecular mechanisms responsible are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that viperin plays an integral part in the ability of interferon to limit the replication of cell-culture-derived HCV (JFH-1) that accurately reflects the complete viral life cycle. Using confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, we demonstrate that viperin localizes and interacts with HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) at the lipid-droplet (LD) interface. In addition, viperin also associates with NS5A and the proviral cellular factor, human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein subtype A (VAP-A), at the HCV replication complex. The ability of viperin to limit HCV replication was dependent on residues within the C-terminus, as well as an N-terminal amphipathic helix. Removal of the amphipathic helix-redirected viperin from the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum and the LD to a homogenous cytoplasmic distribution, coinciding with a loss of antiviral effect. C-terminal viperin mutants still localized to the LD interface and replication complexes, but did not interact with NS5A proteins, as determined by FRET analysis."
25480565,The interaction of KIR3DL1*001 with HLA class I molecules is dependent upon molecular microarchitecture within the Bw4 epitope.,"The killer cell Ig-like receptor 3DL1 (KIR3DL1) inhibits activation of NK cells upon interaction with HLA class I molecules such as HLA-B*57:01, which contains the Bw4 epitope spanning residues 77-83 (e.g., NLRIALR), and not with HLA allomorphs that possess the Bw6 motif (e.g., HLA-B*08:01), which differ at residues 77, 80, 81, 82, and 83. Although Bw4 residues Ile(80) and Arg(83) directly interact with KIR3DL1*001, their precise role in determining KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 specificity remains unclear. Recognition of HLA-B*57:01 by either KIR3DL1(+) NK cells or the NK cell line YTS transfected with KIR3DL1*001 was impaired by mutation of residues 80 and 83 of HLA-B*57:01 to the corresponding amino acids within the Bw6 motif. Conversely, the simultaneous introduction of three Bw4 residues at positions 80, 82, and 83 into HLA-B*08:01 conferred an interaction with KIR3DL1*001. Structural analysis of HLA-B*57:01, HLA-B*08:01, and mutants of each bearing substitutions at positions 80 and 83 revealed that Ile(80) and Arg(83) within the Bw4 motif constrain the conformation of Glu(76), primarily through a salt bridge between Arg(83) and Glu(76). This salt bridge was absent in HLA-Bw6 molecules as well as position 83 mutants of HLA-B*57:01. Mutation of the Bw4 residue Ile(80) also disrupted this salt bridge, providing further insight into the role that position 80 plays in mediating KIR3DL1 recognition. Thus, the strict conformation of HLA-Bw4 allotypes, held in place by the Glu(76)-Arg(83) interaction, facilitates KIR3DL1 binding, whereas Bw6 allotypes present a platform on the α1 helix that is less permissive for KIR3DL1 binding."
26771495,Ebola Viral Glycoprotein Bound to Its Endosomal Receptor Niemann-Pick C1.,"Filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg, cause fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and primates. Understanding how these viruses enter host cells could help to develop effective therapeutics. An endosomal protein, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), has been identified as a necessary entry receptor for this process, and priming of the viral glycoprotein (GP) to a fusion-competent state is a prerequisite for NPC1 binding. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of the primed GP (GPcl) of Ebola virus bound to domain C of NPC1 (NPC1-C) at a resolution of 2.3 Å. NPC1-C utilizes two protruding loops to engage a hydrophobic cavity on head of GPcl. Upon enzymatic cleavage and NPC1-C binding, conformational change in the GPcl further affects the state of the internal fusion loop, triggering membrane fusion. Our data therefore provide structural insights into filovirus entry in the late endosome and the molecular basis for design of therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry."
12897781,"Crystal structure of HLA-A2 bound to LIR-1, a host and viral major histocompatibility complex receptor.","Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LIR-1), an inhibitory receptor expressed on monocytes, dendritic cells and lymphocytes, regulates cellular function by binding a broad range of classical and nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, and the human cytomegalovirus MHC class I homolog UL18. Here we describe the 3.4-A crystal structure of a complex between the LIR-1 D1D2 domains and the MHC class I molecule HLA-A2. LIR-1 contacts the mostly conserved beta(2)-microglobulin and alpha3 domains of HLA-A2. The LIR-1 binding site comprises residues at the interdomain hinge, and a patch at the D1 tip. The structure shows how LIR-1 recognizes UL18 and diverse MHC class I molecules, and indicates that a similar mode of MHC class I recognition is used by other LIR family members."
25512528,Allosteric activation of ADAMTS13 by von Willebrand factor.,"The metalloprotease ADAMTS13 cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) within endovascular platelet aggregates, and ADAMTS13 deficiency causes fatal microvascular thrombosis. The proximal metalloprotease (M), disintegrin-like (D), thrombospondin-1 (T), Cys-rich (C), and spacer (S) domains of ADAMTS13 recognize a cryptic site in VWF that is exposed by tensile force. Another seven T and two complement C1r/C1s, sea urchin epidermal growth factor, and bone morphogenetic protein (CUB) domains of uncertain function are C-terminal to the MDTCS domains. We find that the distal T8-CUB2 domains markedly inhibit substrate cleavage, and binding of VWF or monoclonal antibodies to distal ADAMTS13 domains relieves this autoinhibition. Small angle X-ray scattering data indicate that distal T-CUB domains interact with proximal MDTCS domains. Thus, ADAMTS13 is regulated by substrate-induced allosteric activation, which may optimize VWF cleavage under fluid shear stress in vivo. Distal domains of other ADAMTS proteases may have similar allosteric properties."
17357109,70-kDa heat shock proteins: specific interactions with HLA-DR molecules and their peptide fragments.,"Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70):peptide complexes are involved in MHC class I and class II-restricted antigen presentation enabling enhanced activation of antigen-specific T cells. Here, we investigated the potential of bacterial and mammalian HSP70 molecules to interact with peptide fragments from HLA-DR and the corresponding complete HLA-DR molecules. Peptide fragments were found to interact with DnaK, the HSP70 homologue from E. coli, but less with stress-inducible human Hsp70. Only a peptide sequence exclusively found in rheumatoid arthritis-protective HLA-DR molecules did not interact with DnaK. Subsequently, we investigated the interaction of complete HLA-DR molecules with HSP70 and detected a specific HSP70:HLA-DR interaction, with highest affinity for human stress-inducible Hsp70. In contrast to the peptide fragments, no allele-specific differences in Hsp70 affinity were detected with complete HLA-DR molecules. Interaction with HLA-DR molecules was increased at lowered pH values, whereas HSP70-chaperoned peptides were released at acidic pH, thus HSP70 could serve as scanner and carrier for antigenic peptides of self or foreign origin and transfer chaperoned peptides onto MHC class II molecules in acidic late endosomal compartments. Our findings indicate that direct interaction between mammalian HSP70 and HLA-DR molecules could be involved in the HSP70-mediated enhancement of MHC class II-restricted peptide presentation and CD4(+) T cell activation."
17616579,Cellular cofactors affecting hepatitis C virus infection and replication.,"Recently identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) isolates that are infectious in cell culture provide a genetic system to evaluate the significance of virus-host interactions for HCV replication. We have completed a systematic RNAi screen wherein siRNAs were designed that target 62 host genes encoding proteins that physically interact with HCV RNA or proteins or belong to cellular pathways thought to modulate HCV infection. This includes 10 host proteins that we identify in this study to bind HCV NS5A. siRNAs that target 26 of these host genes alter infectious HCV production >3-fold. Included in this set of 26 were siRNAs that target Dicer, a principal component of the RNAi silencing pathway. Contrary to the hypothesis that RNAi is an antiviral pathway in mammals, as has been reported for subgenomic HCV replicons, siRNAs that target Dicer inhibited HCV replication. Furthermore, siRNAs that target several other components of the RNAi pathway also inhibit HCV replication. MicroRNA profiling of human liver, human hepatoma Huh-7.5 cells, and Huh-7.5 cells that harbor replicating HCV demonstrated that miR-122 is the predominant microRNA in each environment. miR-122 has been previously implicated in positively regulating the replication of HCV genotype 1 replicons. We find that 2'-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotide depletion of miR-122 also inhibits HCV genotype 2a replication and infectious virus production. Our data define 26 host genes that modulate HCV infection and indicate that the requirement for functional RNAi for HCV replication is dominant over any antiviral activity this pathway may exert against HCV."
10570951,Hepatitis C virus NS3 serine protease interacts with the serpin C1 inhibitor.,"Both NS3 protein (1007-1657) and its protease moiety (NS3p, 1027-1207) were able to interact in vitro with C1 Inhibitor (C1Inh) to give a 95-kDa Mr C1Inh cleavage product similar to that obtained upon proteolysis by complement protease C1s. High-Mr reaction products were also detected after incubation of C1Inh with NS3 but not with NS3p; they correspond to ester-bonded complexes from their hydroxylamine lability. Similar reactivity of NS3 was observed upon incubation with alpha2-antiplasmin. Serpin cleavage was prevented by treatment of NS3 with synthetic serine protease inhibitors. This interaction between viral NS3 and host serpins suggests that NS3 is likely to be controlled by infected cell protease inhibitors."
23135708,The adenoviral oncogene E1A-13S interacts with a specific isoform of the tumor suppressor PML to enhance viral transcription.,"PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs), also called ND10, are matrix-bound nuclear structures that have been implicated in a variety of functions, including DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, protein degradation, and tumor suppression. These domains are also known for their potential to mediate an intracellular defense mechanism against many virus types. This is likely why they are targeted and subsequently manipulated by numerous viral proteins. Paradoxically, the genomes of various DNA viruses become associated with PML NBs, and initial sites of viral transcription/replication centers are often juxtaposed to these domains. The question is why viruses start their transcription and replication next to their supposed antagonists. Here, we report that PML NBs are targeted by the adenoviral (Ad) transactivator protein E1A-13S. Alternatively spliced E1A isoforms (E1A-12S and E1A-13S) are the first proteins expressed upon Ad infection. E1A-13S is essential for activating viral transcription in the early phase of infection. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that E1A-13S preferentially interacts with only one (PML-II) of at least six nuclear human PML isoforms. Deletion mapping located the interaction site within E1A conserved region 3 (CR3), which was previously described as the transcription factor binding region of E1A-13S. Indeed, cooperation with PML-II enhanced E1A-mediated transcriptional activation, while deleting the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) of PML proved even more effective. Our results suggest that in contrast to PML NB-associated antiviral defense, PML-II may help transactivate viral gene expression and therefore play a novel role in activating Ad transcription during the early viral life cycle."
16275648,"Basic residues in the nucleocapsid domain of Gag are required for interaction of HIV-1 gag with ABCE1 (HP68), a cellular protein important for HIV-1 capsid assembly.","During human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) assembly, Gag polypeptides multimerize into immature HIV-1 capsids. The cellular ATP-binding protein ABCE1 (also called HP68 or RNase L inhibitor) appears to be critical for proper assembly of the HIV-1 capsid. In primate cells, ABCE1 associates with Gag polypeptides present in immature capsid assembly intermediates. Here we demonstrate that the NC domain of Gag is critical for interaction with endogenous primate ABCE1, whereas other domains in Gag can be deleted without eliminating the association of Gag with ABCE1. NC contains two Cys-His boxes that form zinc finger motifs and are responsible for encapsidation of HIV-1 genomic RNA. In addition, NC contains basic residues known to play a critical role in nonspecific RNA binding, Gag-Gag interactions, and particle formation. We demonstrate that basic residues in NC are needed for the Gag-ABCE1 interaction, whereas the cysteine and histidine residues in the zinc fingers are dispensable. Constructs that fail to interact with primate ABCE1 or interact poorly also fail to form capsids and are arrested at an early point in the immature capsid assembly pathway. Whereas others have shown that basic residues in NC bind nonspecifically to RNA, which in turn scaffolds or nucleates assembly, our data demonstrate that the same basic residues in NC act either directly or indirectly to recruit a cellular protein that also promotes capsid formation. Thus, in cells, basic residues in NC appear to act by two mechanisms, recruiting both RNA and a cellular ATPase in order to facilitate efficient assembly of HIV-1 capsids."
25210169,Interaction of adenovirus type 5 E4orf4 with the nuclear pore subunit Nup205 is required for proper viral gene expression.,"Adenovirus type 5 E4orf4 is a multifunctional protein that regulates viral gene expression. The activities of E4orf4 are mainly mediated through binding to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). E4orf4 recruits target phosphoproteins into complexes with PP2A, resulting in dephosphorylation of host factors, such as SR splicing factors. In the current study, we utilized immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry to identify novel E4orf4-interacting proteins. In this manner we identified Nup205, a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) as an E4orf4 interacting partner. The arginine-rich motif (ARM) of E4orf4 was required for interaction with Nup205 and for nuclear localization of E4orf4. ARMs are commonly found on viral nuclear proteins, and we observed that Nup205 interacts with three different nuclear viral proteins containing ARMs. E4orf4 formed a trimolecular complex containing both Nup205 and PP2A. Furthermore, Nup205 complexed with E4orf4 was hypophosphorylated, suggesting that the protein is specifically targeted for dephosphorylation. An adenovirus mutant that does not express E4orf4 (Orf4(-)) displayed elevated early and reduced late gene expression relative to that of the wild type. We observed that knockdown of Nup205 resulted in the same phenotype as that of the Orf4(-) virus, suggesting that the proteins function as a complex to regulate viral gene expression. Furthermore, knockdown of Nup205 resulted in a more than a 4-fold reduction in the replication of wild-type adenovirus. Our data show for first time that Ad5 E4orf4 interacts with and modifies the NPC and that Nup205-E4orf4 binding is required for normal regulation of viral gene expression and viral replication."
20133869,ISG15 conjugation system targets the viral NS1 protein in influenza A virus-infected cells.,"ISG15 is an IFN-alpha/beta-induced, ubiquitin-like protein that is conjugated to a wide array of cellular proteins through the sequential action of three conjugation enzymes that are also induced by IFN-alpha/beta. Recent studies showed that ISG15 and/or its conjugates play an important role in protecting cells from infection by several viruses, including influenza A virus. However, the mechanism by which ISG15 modification exerts antiviral activity has not been established. Here we extend the repertoire of ISG15 targets to a viral protein by demonstrating that the NS1 protein of influenza A virus (NS1A protein), an essential, multifunctional protein, is ISG15 modified in virus-infected cells. We demonstrate that the major ISG15 acceptor site in the NS1A protein in infected cells is a critical lysine residue (K41) in the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD). ISG15 modification of K41 disrupts the association of the NS1A RBD domain with importin-alpha, the protein that mediates nuclear import of the NS1A protein, whereas the RBD retains its double-stranded RNA-binding activity. Most significantly, we show that ISG15 modification of K41 inhibits influenza A virus replication and thus contributes to the antiviral action of IFN-beta. We also show that the NS1A protein directly and specifically binds to Herc5, the major E3 ligase for ISG15 conjugation in human cells. These results establish a ""loss of function"" mechanism for the antiviral activity of the IFN-induced ISG15 conjugation system, namely, that it inhibits viral replication by conjugating ISG15 to a specific viral protein, thereby inhibiting its function."
19293378,"The Epstein-Barr virus Bcl-2 homolog, BHRF1, blocks apoptosis by binding to a limited amount of Bim.","Current knowledge suggests that the balance between life and death within a cell can be controlled by the stable engagement of Bcl-2-related proapoptotic proteins such as Bak, Bax, and Bim by survival proteins such as Bcl-2. BHRF1 is a prosurvival molecule from Epstein-Barr virus that has a high degree of homology to Bcl-2. To understand how BHRF1 blocks apoptosis, BHRF1 and mutants of BHRF1 were expressed in primary cells and an IL-2-dependent T cell line. BHRF1 bound the Executioner Bak and, when cells were cultured without cytokines, BHRF1 associated with Bim. A point mutation that lost the ability to bind Bak retained its ability to bind Bim and to protect cells. This result demonstrated that it was the capacity of BHRF1 to bind Bim, not Bak, that provided protection. Interestingly, the amount of Bim bound by BHRF1 was minimal when compared with the amount of Bim induced by apoptosis. Thus, BHRF1 does not act by simply absorbing the excess Bim produced while cells prepare for death. Rather, BHRF1 may act either by binding preferentially the most lethal form of Bim or by acting catalytically on Bim to block apoptosis."
21667337,Host cell protein C9orf69 promotes viral proliferation via interaction with HSV-1 UL25 protein.,"In light of the scarcity of reports on the interaction between HSV-1 nucleocapsid protein UL25 and its host cell proteins, the purpose of this study is to use yeast two-hybrid screening to search for cellular proteins that can interact with the UL25 protein. C9orf69, a protein of unknown function was identified. The interaction between the two proteins under physiological conditions was also confirmed by biological experiments including co-localization by fluorescence and immunoprecipitation. A preliminary study of the function of C9orf69 showed that it promotes viral proliferation. Further studies showed that C9orf69 did not influence viral multiplication efficiency by transcriptional regulation of viral genes, but indirectly promoted proliferation via interaction with UL25."
23523133,Nup153 and Nup98 bind the HIV-1 core and contribute to the early steps of HIV-1 replication.,"The early steps of HIV-1 replication involve the entry of HIV-1 into the nucleus, which is characterized by viral interactions with nuclear pore components. HIV-1 developed an evolutionary strategy to usurp the nuclear pore machinery and chromatin in order to integrate and efficiently express viral genes. In the current work, we studied the role of nucleoporins 153 and 98 (Nup153 and Nup98) in infection of human Jurkat lymphocytes by HIV-1. We showed that Nup153-depleted cells exhibited a defect in nuclear import, while depletion of Nup 98 caused a slight defect in HIV integration. To explore the biochemical viral determinants for the requirement of Nup153 and Nup98 during HIV-1 infection, we tested the ability of these nucleoporins to interact with HIV-1 cores. Our findings showed that both nucleoporins bind HIV-1 cores suggesting that this interaction is important for HIV-1 nuclear import and/or integration. Distribution analysis of integration sites in Nup153-depleted cells revealed a reduced tendency of HIV-1 to integrate in intragenic sites, which in part could account for the large infectivity defect observed in Nup153-depleted cells. Our work strongly supports a role for Nup153 in HIV-1 nuclear import and integration."
16611232,A Salmonella type III secretion effector interacts with the mammalian serine/threonine protein kinase PKN1.,"Essential to salmonellae pathogenesis is an export device called the type III secretion system (TTSS), which mediates the transfer of bacterial effector proteins from the bacterial cell into the host cell cytoplasm. Once inside the host cell, these effectors are then capable of altering a variety of host cellular functions in order to promote bacterial survival and colonization. SspH1 is a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium TTSS effector that localizes to the mammalian nucleus and down-modulates production of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent gene expression. To identify mammalian binding partners of SspH1 a yeast two-hybrid screen against a human spleen cDNA library was performed. It yielded a serine/threonine protein kinase called protein kinase N 1 (PKN1). The leucine-rich repeat domain of SspH1 was demonstrated to mediate this interaction and also inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression. This suggested that PKN1 may play a role in modulation of the NF-kappaB signalling pathway. Indeed, we found that expression of constitutively active PKN1 in mammalian cells results in a decrease, while depletion of PKN1 by RNA interference causes an increase in NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression. These data indicate that SspH1 may inhibit the host's inflammatory response by interacting with PKN1."
10922058,Energetics of the HIV gp120-CD4 binding reaction.,"HIV infection is initiated by the selective interaction between the cellular receptor CD4 and gp120, the external envelope glycoprotein of the virus. We used analytical ultracentrifugation, titration calorimetry, and surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis to characterize the assembly state, thermodynamics, and kinetics of the CD4-gp120 interaction. The binding thermodynamics were of unexpected magnitude; changes in enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity greatly exceeded those described for typical protein-protein interactions. These unusual thermodynamic properties were observed with both intact gp120 and a deglycosylated and truncated form of gp120 protein that lacked hypervariable loops V1, V2, and V3 and segments of its N and C termini. Together with previous crystallographic studies, the large changes in heat capacity and entropy reveal that extensive structural rearrangements occur within the core of gp120 upon CD4 binding. CD spectral studies and slow kinetics of binding support this conclusion. These results indicate considerable conformational flexibility within gp120, which may relate to viral mechanisms for triggering infection and disguising conserved receptor-binding sites from the immune system."
16762926,Anthrax toxin receptor 1/tumor endothelium marker 8 mediates cell spreading by coupling extracellular ligands to the actin cytoskeleton.,"Tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) is induced in tumor-associated vasculature and acts as a receptor for Protective Antigen (PA), the cell-binding component of the anthrax toxin determinant for toxin entrance into cells. However, the normal function for TEM8 remains unknown. We show that TEM8 functions as an adhesion molecule mediating cell spreading on immobilized PA and collagen I. The mechanism for TEM8 interaction with collagen I was cell type-specific, because binding to collagen I was abrogated by beta1 integrin function blocking antibody in HEK293 cells, but not in primary synovial rabbit fibroblasts. Binding to PA remained unaffected by the addition of beta1 integrin function blocking antibody. Whereas the extracellular and transmembrane domains of TEM8 were sufficient to provide cell attachment, the intracellular domain was critical for spreading. Fusion of the cytosolic domain of TEM8 to the IL-2 receptor, conferred cell-spreading capability on IL-2 receptor antibody substrates. The cytoplasmic domain mediated linkage with the actin cytoskeleton as it co-precipitated actin and determined partitioning of TEM8 to the actin-containing detergent insoluble cellular fraction. TEM8 anchorage to actin was relevant as spreading was inhibited by the cytoskeleton-disrupting drug cytochalasin D, but persisted in the presence of the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole, and in cells lacking intermediate filaments. Thus, our results indicate that TEM8 is a new adhesion molecule linking collagen I or PA to the actin cytoskeleton."
10394361,Activation of Vav by Nef induces cytoskeletal rearrangements and downstream effector functions.,"Nef of primate lentiviruses is critical for high levels of viremia and the progression to AIDS. Nef associates with and activates a serine/threonine kinase (Nef-associated kinase [NAK]) via the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. We identified the protooncogene and guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav as the specific binding partner of Nef proteins from HIV-1 and SIV. The interaction between Nef and Vav led to increased activity of Vav and its downstream effectors. Both cytoskeletal changes and the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were observed. Furthermore, a dominant-negative Vav protein inhibited NAK activation and viral replication. Thus, the interaction between Nef and Vav initiates a signaling cascade that changes structural and physiological parameters in the infected cell."
19906925,Identification of the cellular prohibitin 1/prohibitin 2 heterodimer as an interaction partner of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the HIV-1 glycoprotein.,"Our studies aim to elucidate the functions carried out by the very long, and in its length highly conserved, C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Env-CT) of the HIV-1 glycoprotein. Mass spectrometric analysis of cellular proteins bound to a tagged version of the HIV Env-CT led to the identification of the prohibitin 1 and 2 proteins (Phb1 and Phb2). These ubiquitously expressed proteins, which exist as stable heterodimers, have been shown to have multiple functions within cells and to localize to multiple cellular and extracellular compartments. The specificity of binding of the Phb1/Phb2 complex to the Env-CT was confirmed in various manners, including coimmunoprecipitation with authentic provirally encoded, full-length Env. Strong binding was dependent on Env residues 790 to 800 and could be severely inhibited by the double mutation L799R/L800Q but not by mutation of these amino acids individually. Analysis of the respective mutant virions revealed that their different abilities to bind Phb1/Phb2 correlated with their replicative properties. Thus, mutated virions with single mutations [HIV-Env-(L799R) and HIV-Env-(L800Q)] replicated similarly to wild-type HIV, but HIV-Env-(L799R/L800Q) virions, which cannot bind Phb1/Phb2, exhibited a cell-dependent replicative phenotype similar to that of HIV-Env-Tr712, lacking the entire Env-CT domain. Thus, replicative spread was achieved, although somewhat delayed, in ""permissive"" MT-4 cells but failed to occur in ""nonpermissive"" H9 T cells. These results point to binding of the Phb1/Phb2 complex to the Env-CT as being of importance for replicative spread in nonpermissive cells, possibly by modulating critical Phb-dependent cellular process(es)."
17939992,Herpes simplex virus-infected cell protein 0 blocks the silencing of viral DNA by dissociating histone deacetylases from the CoREST-REST complex.,"A preeminent phenotype of the infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is that it acts as a promiscuous transactivator. In most cell lines exposed to DeltaICP0 mutant virus at low ratios of virus per cell infection, alpha genes are expressed but the transition to beta and gamma gene expression does not ensue, but can be enhanced by inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Earlier studies have shown that ICP0 interacts with CoREST and displaces HDAC1 from the CoREST-REST-HDAC1/2 complex. HDAC1 and CoREST are then independently translocated to the cytoplasm. Here, we test the hypothesis that ICP0 blocks the silencing of HSV DNA by displacing HDAC1 from the CoREST-REST complex. Specifically, first, mapping studies led us to construct a truncated CoREST (CoREST(146-482)) that in transfected cells displaced HDAC1 from the CoREST-REST complex. Second, we constructed two viruses. In BACs encoding the entire HSV-1, we replaced the gene encoding ICP0 with AmpR to yield a DeltaICP0 mutant R8501. We also replaced ICP0 with CoREST(146-482) to yield recombinant R8502. The yield of R8502 mutant virus in Vero, HEp-2, and human embryonic lung cells exposed to 0.1 pfu of virus per cell was 100-, 10-, and 10-fold higher, respectively, than those of R8501 mutant virus. In Vero cells, the yield of R8502 was identical with that of wild-type virus. We conclude that CoREST(146-482) functionally replaced ICP0 and that, by extension, ICP0 acts to block the silencing of viral DNA by displacing HDAC1/2 from the CoREST-REST complex."
24402281,Structural basis for hijacking CBF-β and CUL5 E3 ligase complex by HIV-1 Vif.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protein Vif has a central role in the neutralization of host innate defences by hijacking cellular proteasomal degradation pathways to subvert the antiviral activity of host restriction factors; however, the underlying mechanism by which Vif achieves this remains unclear. Here we report a crystal structure of the Vif-CBF-β-CUL5-ELOB-ELOC complex. The structure reveals that Vif, by means of two domains, organizes formation of the pentameric complex by interacting with CBF-β, CUL5 and ELOC. The larger domain (α/β domain) of Vif binds to the same side of CBF-β as RUNX1, indicating that Vif and RUNX1 are exclusive for CBF-β binding. Interactions of the smaller domain (α-domain) of Vif with ELOC and CUL5 are cooperative and mimic those of SOCS2 with the latter two proteins. A unique zinc-finger motif of Vif, which is located between the two Vif domains, makes no contacts with the other proteins but stabilizes the conformation of the α-domain, which may be important for Vif-CUL5 interaction. Together, our data reveal the structural basis for Vif hijacking of the CBF-β and CUL5 E3 ligase complex, laying a foundation for rational design of novel anti-HIV drugs."
14523451,Staphylocoagulase is a prototype for the mechanism of cofactor-induced zymogen activation.,"Many bacterial pathogens secrete proteins that activate host trypsinogen-like enzyme precursors, most notably the proenzymes of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysis systems. Staphylococcus aureus, an important human pathogen implicated in sepsis and endocarditis, secretes the cofactor staphylocoagulase, which activates prothrombin, without the usual proteolytic cleavages, to directly initiate blood clotting. Here we present the 2.2 A crystal structures of human alpha-thrombin and prethrombin-2 bound to a fully active staphylocoagulase variant. The cofactor consists of two domains, each with three-helix bundles; this is a novel fold that is distinct from known serine proteinase activators, particularly the streptococcal plasminogen activator streptokinase. The staphylocoagulase fold is conserved in other bacterial plasma-protein-binding factors and extracellular-matrix-binding factors. Kinetic studies confirm the importance of isoleucine 1 and valine 2 at the amino terminus of staphylocoagulase for zymogen activation. In addition to making contacts with the 148 loop and (pro)exosite I of prethrombin-2, staphylocoagulase inserts its N-terminal peptide into the activation pocket of bound prethrombin-2, allosterically inducing functional catalytic machinery. These investigations demonstrate unambiguously the validity of the zymogen-activation mechanism known as 'molecular sexuality'."
21532619,The HTLV-1 Tax protein inhibits formation of stress granules by interacting with histone deacetylase 6.,"Human T cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of a fatal adult T-cell leukemia. Through deregulation of multiple cellular signaling pathways the viral Tax protein has a pivotal role in T-cell transformation. In response to stressful stimuli, cells mount a cellular stress response to limit the damage that environmental forces inflict on DNA or proteins. During stress response, cells postpone the translation of most cellular mRNAs, which are gathered into cytoplasmic mRNA-silencing foci called stress granules (SGs) and allocate their available resources towards the production of dedicated stress-management proteins. Here we demonstrate that Tax controls the formation of SGs and interferes with the cellular stress response pathway. In agreement with previous reports, we observed that Tax relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to environmental stress. We found that the presence of Tax in the cytoplasm of stressed cells prevents the formation of SGs and counteracts the shutoff of specific host proteins. Unexpectedly, nuclear localization of Tax promotes spontaneous aggregation of SGs, even in the absence of stress. Mutant analysis revealed that the SG inhibitory capacity of Tax is independent of its transcriptional abilities but relies on its interaction with histone deacetylase 6, a critical component of SGs. Importantly, the stress-protective effect of Tax was also observed in the context of HTLV-1 infected cells, which were shown to be less prone to form SGs and undergo apoptosis under arsenite exposure. These observations identify Tax as the first virally encoded inhibitory component of SGs and unravel a new strategy developed by HTLV-1 to deregulate normal cell processes. We postulate that inhibition of the stress response pathway by Tax would favor cell survival under stressful conditions and may have an important role in HTLV-1-induced cellular transformation."
7971969,Induced gene expression of the hypusine-containing protein eukaryotic initiation factor 5A in activated human T lymphocytes.,"The hypusine-containing protein eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) is a cellular cofactor critically required for the function of the Rev transactivator protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). eIF-5A localizes in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of mammalian cells, suggesting possible activities on the level of regulated mRNA transport and/or protein translation. In this report we show that eIF-5A gene expression is constitutively low but inducible with T-lymphocyte-specific stimuli in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy individuals. In contrast, eIF-5A is constitutively expressed at high levels in human cell lines as well as in various human organs. Comparison of eIF-5A levels in the PBMCs of uninfected and HIV-1-infected donors shows a significant upregulation of eIF-5A gene expression in the PBMCs of HIV-1 patients, compatible with a possible role of eIF-5A in HIV-1 replication during T-cell activation."
9465063,Interaction of the HIV-1 rev cofactor eukaryotic initiation factor 5A with ribosomal protein L5.,"It has previously been shown that interaction of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) with the Rev trans-activator protein of HIV-1 mediates the transport of unspliced or incompletely spliced viral mRNAs across the nuclear envelope. Consequently, mutants of eIF-5A block Rev function and thereby replication of HIV-1 in trans, indicating that eIF-5A is a crucial protein that connects the viral Rev regulator with cellular RNA transport systems. Here we show that the ribosomal protein L5, which is the central protein component of the 5S rRNA export system, is a cellular interaction partner of eIF-5A. Functional studies demonstrate that overexpression of L5 protein significantly enhances Rev activity. Furthermore, Rev nuclear export activity is inhibited in human somatic cells by antibodies that recognize eIF-5A or L5. Our data suggest that the Rev export pathway shares components of a cellular transport system involved in the intracellular trafficking of polymerase III (5S rRNA) transcripts."
9285100,Interaction of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev response element RNA and U6 snRNA requires deoxyhypusine or hypusine modification.,"Hypusine formation on the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) precursor represents a unique posttranslational modification that is ubiquitously present in eukaryotic cells and archaebacteria. Specific inhibition of deoxyhypusine synthase leads to growth arrest and cell death. The precise cellular function of eIF-5A and the physiological significance of hypusine modification are not clear. Although the methionyl-puromycin synthesis has been suggested to be the functional assay for eIF-5A activity in vitro, the role of eIF-5A in protein synthesis has not been established. Recent studies have suggested that eIF-5A may be the cellular target of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Rex proteins. Motif analysis suggested that eIF-5A resembles a bimodular RNA-binding protein in that it contains a stretch of basic amino acids clustered at the N-terminal region and a leucine-rich stretch at the C-terminal region. Using Rev target RNA, RRE, as a model, we tested the hypothesis that eIF-5A may be an RNA-binding protein. We found that both deoxyhypusine and hypusine-containing eIF-5A can bind to the 252-nt RRE RNA, as determined by a gel mobility shift assay. In contrast, the unmodified eIF-5A precursor cannot. Deoxyhypusine-containing eIF-5A, but not its precursor, could also cause supershift of the Rev stem-loop IIB RRE complex. Preliminary studies also indicated that eIF-5A can bind to RNA such as U6 snRNA and that deoxyhypusine modification appears to be required for the binding. The ability of eIF-5A to directly interact with RNA suggests that deoxyhypusine formation of eIF-5A may be related to its role in RNA processing and protein synthesis. Our study also suggests the possibility of using a gel mobility shift assay for eIF-5A-RNA binding as a functional assay for deoxyhypusine and hypusine formation."
9820841,"Interaction of human papillomavirus 8 regulatory proteins E2, E6 and E7 with components of the TFIID complex.","Human papillomavirus 8 (HPV8) is one of the oncogenic HPV types specifically associated with skin cancers of epidermodysplasia verruciformis patients. The early gene products of this virus exert functions in transformation (E2, E6, E7), replication (E1, E2) and in the control of viral transcription (E2, E7). Many viral and cellular transactivators of transcription have been shown to interact selectively and directly with a number of TATA-box-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors (TAFIIs), which then play a role as coactivators. Using glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments, we tested in vitro interactions between GST-HPV8-E1, -E2, -E6 and -E7 and 7 in-vitro-translated TAFIIs in the human (h) system (hTAFII18, hTAFII20, hTAFII28, hTAFII30, hTAFII55, hTAFII100, hTAFIIDeltaN135) or TBP. We could show that GST-HPV8-E2 interacts directly at least with hTAFII55 and TBP. Deletion analysis indicated that a domain overlapping with the C-terminal moiety of HPV8-E2 is required for binding to TBP, whereas determinants for interactions with hTAFII55 are in the central and C-terminal part of the E2 protein. In similar binding studies, GST-HPV8-E6 interacted with hTAFII28, hTAFIIDeltaN135 and TBP, and more weakly with hTAFII20, whereas GST- HPV8-E7 bound to hTAFII20, hTAFII28, hTAFII55, hTAFIIDeltaN135 and TBP. Deletion analysis revealed that the C-terminal part of HPV8-E7 is required for the interaction with these hTAFIIs. In contrast, no interactions were observed between GST-HPV8-E1 and in-vitro-translated hTAFIIs."
9282826,"HIV-1 p17 and IFN-gamma both induce fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase.","The p17 matrix protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) plays a crucial role in AIDS pathogenesis. It orchestrates viral assembly and directs the preintegration complex to the nucleus of infected cells. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of p17 was shown to resemble that of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), suggesting that both proteins might share analogous functions. We demonstrate that in monocytes, p17 shares with IFN-gamma the ability to induce 1alpha-hydroxylase activity and to activate fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase gene expression in the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. However, p17 does not bind to the IFN-gamma cell membrane receptor and fails to increase expression of IFN-gamma-induced proteins, such as tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, Fc gammaRI, and HLA DR or B7/BB1 antigens. Altogether, our results raise the possibility that the structural resemblance between p17 and IFN-gamma causes the selective activation of a common pathway resulting in the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. We also found that unlike IFN-gamma, p17 increases the intracellular ATP content. Since transport of the HIV-1 preintegration complex through the nuclear membrane is an ATP-dependent process, our observation suggests that p17 plays a double role in this active transport, not only by acting as a chaperone molecule but also by recruiting the necessary energy for this process."
25631074,Analysis of HIV-1 Gag protein interactions via biotin ligase tagging.,"We have examined the interactions of wild-type (WT) and matrix protein-deleted (ΔMA) HIV-1 precursor Gag (PrGag) proteins in virus-producing cells using a biotin ligase-tagging approach. To do so, WT and ΔMA PrGag proteins were tagged with the Escherichia coli promiscuous biotin ligase (BirA*), expressed in cells, and examined. Localization patterns of PrGag proteins and biotinylated proteins overlapped, consistent with observations that BirA*-tagged proteins biotinylate neighbor proteins that are in close proximity. Results indicate that BirA*-tagged PrGag proteins biotinylated themselves as well as WT PrGag proteins in trans. Previous data have shown that the HIV-1 Envelope (Env) protein requires an interaction with MA for assembly into virions. Unexpectedly, ΔMA proteins biotinylated Env, whereas WT BirA*-tagged proteins did not, suggesting that the presence of MA made Env inaccessible to biotinylation. We also identified over 50 cellular proteins that were biotinylated by BirA*-tagged PrGag proteins. These included membrane proteins, cytoskeleton-associated proteins, nuclear transport factors, lipid metabolism regulators, translation factors, and RNA-processing proteins. The identification of these biotinylated proteins offers new insights into HIV-1 Gag protein trafficking and activities and provides new potential targets for antiviral interference."
26362536,Proteomic analysis of HIV-1 Gag interacting partners using proximity-dependent biotinylation.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag polyprotein is necessary and sufficient to assemble non-infectious particles. Given that HIV-1 subverts many host proteins at all stages of its life cycle, it is essential to identify these interactions as potential targets for antiretroviral therapy."
9811770,An endogenous inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus in human lymphocytes is overcome by the viral Vif protein.,"The vif gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a basic Mr 23,000 protein that is necessary for production of infectious virions by nonpermissive cells (human lymphocytes and macrophages) but not by permissive cells such as HeLa-CD4. It had been proposed that permissive cells may contain an unidentified factor that functions like the viral Vif protein. To test this hypothesis, we produced pseudotyped wild-type and vif-deleted HIV gpt virions (which contain the HIV-1 genome with the bacterial mycophenolic acid resistance gene gpt in place of the viral env gene) in permissive cells, and we used them to generate nonpermissive H9 leukemic T cells that express these proviruses. We then fused these H9 cells with permissive HeLa cells that express the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120-gp41, and we asked whether the heterokaryons would release infectious HIV gpt virions. The results clearly showed that the vif-deleted virions released by the heterokaryons were noninfectious whereas the wild-type virions were highly infectious. This strongly suggests that nonpermissive cells, the natural targets of HIV-1, contain a potent endogenous inhibitor of HIV-1 replication that is overcome by Vif."
7543589,Cyclophilin binding to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag polyprotein is mimicked by an anti-cyclosporine antibody.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is unique among retroviruses in that infectivity requires specific incorporation into virions of the cellular protein cyclophilin A through interactions with the Gag polyprotein. Here we show that monoclonal antibody B11 1.4, which recognizes a cyclophilin-binding epitope on cyclosporine, detects denatured or native human immunodeficiency virus type 1 capsid. B11 1.4 does not recognize the capsids of other retroviruses, and binding is inhibited by cyclosporine or by cyclophilin A."
8662505,Structure of the amino-terminal core domain of the HIV-1 capsid protein.,"The three-dimensional structure of the amino-terminal core domain (residues 1 through 151) of the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) capsid protein has been solved by multidimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure is unlike those of previously characterized viral coat proteins and is composed of seven alpha helices, two beta hairpins, and an exposed partially ordered loop. The domain is shaped like an arrowhead, with the beta hairpins and loop exposed at the trailing edge and the carboxyl-terminal helix projecting from the tip. The proline residue Pro1 forms a salt bridge with a conserved, buried aspartate residue (Asp51), which suggests that the amino terminus of the protein rearranges upon proteolytic maturation. The binding site for cyclophilin A, a cellular rotamase that is packaged into the HIV-1 virion, is located on the exposed loop and encompasses the essential proline residue Pro90. In the free monomeric domain, Pro90 adopts kinetically trapped cis and trans conformations, raising the possibility that cyclophilin A catalyzes interconversion of the cis- and trans-Pro90 loop structures."
7969495,Functional association of cyclophilin A with HIV-1 virions.,"Cyclophilins are a family of proteins that bind the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A, possess peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, and assist in the folding of proteins. Human cyclophilins A and B are host cell proteins that bind specifically to the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein p55gag in vitro. Here we report that viral particles formed by p55gag, in contrast to particles formed by the Gag polyproteins of other retroviruses, contain significant amounts of cyclophilin A. Sequences in the capsid domain of p55gag are both required and sufficient for the virion-association of cyclophilin A. The association of cyclophilin A with HIV-1 virions was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by cyclosporin A as well as by SDZ NIM811 ([Melle-4]cyclosporin), a non-immunosuppressive analogue of cyclosporin A. Drug-induced reductions in virion-associated cyclophilin A levels were accompanied by reductions in virion infectivity, indicating that the association is functionally relevant. Moreover, SDZ NIM811 inhibited the replication of HIV-1 but was inactive against SIVMAC, a primate immunodeficiency virus closely related to HIV-1, which does not incorporate cyclophilin A."
8709190,The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 capsid p2 domain confers sensitivity to the cyclophilin-binding drug SDZ NIM 811.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) specifically incorporates the host cell peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A into virions via contacts with the capsid (CA) domain of the Gag polyprotein Pr55gag. The immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A and the nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporin A analog SDZ NIM 811 bind to cyclophilin A and inhibit its incorporation into HIV-1 virions. Both drugs inhibit the virion association of cyclophilin A and the replication of HIV-1 with a similar dose dependence. In contrast, these compounds are inactive against other primate lentiviruses which do not incorporate cyclophilin A, such as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). To locate determinants which confer sensitivity to SDZ NIM 811, we generated chimeric proviruses between HIV-1 and SIVmac. A hybrid SIVmac which has the CA-p2 domain of the Gag polyprotein replaced by the corresponding domain from HIV-1 replicated in an established CD4+ cell line and in human but not macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The transfer of the HIV-1 CA-p2 domain to SIVmac led to the efficient incorporation of cyclophilin A, and SDZ NIM 811 effectively inhibited both the virion association of cyclophilin A and the spread of the hybrid virus in infected cultures. We conclude that the HIV-1 CA-p2 domain contains determinants which confer the necessity to interact with cyclophilin A for efficient virus replication. Furthermore, our data show that the CA-p2 domain can play a crucial role in species tropism."
9743208,Increased PGE2 production mediates the in vitro inhibitory effect of the human immunodeficiency virus P24 immunosuppressive heptapeptide Ch7.,"Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a synthetic heptapeptide (Ch7), corresponding to a conserved sequence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) core protein p24 (amino acids 232-238), was able to specifically abrogate antigen-induced responses in cultures of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Addition of recombinant human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to Ch7-suppressed cultures restored the capacity to mount an antigen-specific antibody response, suggesting that a cytokine imbalance may be at the basis of the Ch7 immunosuppressive activity. In the present paper we show that the Ch7-dependent in vitro immunosuppression was accompanied by a significant up-regulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and induction of interleukin-10 (IL-10)-secreting cells. In the presence of the PGE2 inhibitor indomethacin, IL-10 up-regulation was prevented and the induction of a specific antibody response was partially restored. PGE2 is indeed an important regulator of immune responses with the ability to differentially affect cytokine production. Thus, our results demonstrate that the Ch7 immunosuppressive epitope may primarily act by up-regulating PGE2 production and, through this mediator, by causing a cytokine dysregulation, finally responsible for immune response suppression."
15596808,Methylation of Tat by PRMT6 regulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene expression.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transactivator protein, Tat, stimulates transcription from the viral long terminal repeats via an arginine-rich transactivating domain. Since arginines are often known to be methylated, we investigated whether HIV type 1 (HIV-1) Tat was a substrate for known protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). Here we identify Tat as a substrate for the arginine methyltransferase, PRMT6. Tat is specifically associated with and methylated by PRMT6 within cells. Overexpression of wild-type PRMT6, but not a methylase-inactive PRMT6 mutant, decreased Tat transactivation of an HIV-1 long terminal repeat luciferase reporter plasmid in a dose-dependent manner. Knocking down PRMT6 consistently increased HIV-1 production in HEK293T cells and also led to increased viral infectiousness as shown in multinuclear activation of a galactosidase indicator assays. Our study demonstrates that arginine methylation of Tat negatively regulates its transactivation activity and that PRMT6 acts as a restriction factor for HIV replication."
11696595,The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 accessory protein Vpu induces apoptosis by suppressing the nuclear factor kappaB-dependent expression of antiapoptotic factors.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 Vpu is an integral membrane protein with a unique affinity for betaTrCP (TrCP), a key member of the SkpI-Cullin-F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is involved in the regulated degradation of cellular proteins, including IkappaB. Remarkably, Vpu is resistant to TrCP-mediated degradation and competitively inhibits TrCP-dependent degradation of IkappaB, resulting in the suppression of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity in Vpu-expressing cells. We now report that Vpu, through its interaction with TrCP, potently contributes to the induction of apoptosis in HIV-infected T cells. Vpu-induced apoptosis is specific and independent of other viral proteins. Mutation of a TrCP-binding motif in Vpu abolishes its apoptogenic property, demonstrating a close correlation between this property of Vpu and its ability to inhibit NF-kappaB activity. The involvement of NF-kappaB in Vpu-induced apoptosis is further supported by the finding that the levels of antiapoptotic factors Bcl-xL, A1/Bfl-1, and TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)1, all of which are expressed in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner, are reduced and, at the same time, levels of active caspase-3 are elevated. Thus, Vpu induces apoptosis through activation of the caspase pathway by way of inhibiting the NF-kappaB-dependent expression of antiapoptotic genes."
9846577,Evidence for a newly discovered cellular anti-HIV-1 phenotype.,"Animal cells have developed many ways to suppress viral replication, and viruses have evolved diverse strategies to resist these. Here we provide evidence that the virion infectivity factor protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) functions to counteract a newly discovered activity in human cells that otherwise inhibits virus replication. This anti-viral phenotype is shown by human T cells, the principal in vivo targets for HIV-1, and, based on our present understanding of virion infectivity factor action, is presumed to act by interfering with a late step(s) in the virus life cycle. These observations indicate that the inhibition of virion infectivity factor function in vivo may prevent HIV-1 replication by 'unmasking' an innate anti-viral phenotype."
9875332,Gag protein from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 assembles in the absence of cyclophilin A.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication requires coordinated activities of host and viral factors. We reported previously that interactions of the host factor cyclophilin A with HIV-1 Gag polyproteins affected Gag processing and maturation of virus particles (Streblow et al., 1998. Virology 245, 197-202). We now use in vitro translation and physical analysis of Gag structures to refine our understanding of how cyclophilin A affects HIV-1 replication. Gag assembled into oligomeric structures in vitro in the presence or absence of cyclophilin A, and proteins synthesized under the two conditions were equally susceptible to cleavage by exogenous HIV-1 protease. These and previous data show that Cyclophilin A is required at a step between Gag assembly and Gag processing/virion morphogenesis. Cyclophilin A may be required for Gag conformational changes subsequent to assembly, that are required for efficient dimerization and activation of the viral protease."
26355087,Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Viral Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 Interacts with a Member of the Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15 Pathway.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a gammaherpesvirus known to establish lifelong latency in the human host. We and others have previously shown that three KSHV homologs of cellular interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), known as viral IRFs (vIRFs), participate in evasion of the host interferon (IFN) response. We report that vIRF1 interacts with the cellular interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) E3 ligase, HERC5, in the context of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation and IFN induction. The ISG15 protein is covalently conjugated to target proteins upon activation of the interferon response. Interaction between vIRF1 and HERC5 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation, and the region between amino acids 224 and 349 of vIRF1 was required for interaction with HERC5. We further report that expression of vIRF1 in the context of TLR3 activation results in decreased ISG15 conjugation of proteins. Specifically, TLR3-induced ISG15 conjugation and protein levels of cellular IRF3, a known ISG15 target, were decreased in the presence of vIRF1 compared to the control. vIRF1 itself was also identified as a target of ISG15 conjugation. KSHV-infected cells exhibited increased ISG15 conjugation upon reactivation from latency in coordination with increased IFN. Furthermore, knockdown of ISG15 in latently infected cells resulted in a higher level of KSHV reactivation and an increase in infectious virus. These data suggest that the KSHV vIRF1 protein affects ISG15 conjugation and interferon responses and may contribute to effective KSHV replication."
18045938,Integrin alphaVbeta3 Binds to the RGD motif of glycoprotein B of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and functions as an RGD-dependent entry receptor.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) envelope-associated glycoprotein B (gB) is involved in the initial steps of binding to host cells during KSHV infection. gB contains an RGD motif reported to bind the integrin alpha(3)beta(1) during virus entry. Although the ligand specificity of alpha(3)beta(1) has been controversial, current literature indicates that alpha(3)beta(1) ligand recognition is independent of RGD. We compared alpha(3)beta(1) to the RGD-binding integrin, alpha(V)beta(3), for binding to envelope-associated gB and a gB(RGD) peptide. Adhesion assays demonstrated that beta(3)-CHO cells overexpressing alpha(V)beta(3) specifically bound gB(RGD), whereas alpha(3)-CHO cells overexpressing alpha(3)beta(1) did not. Function-blocking antibodies to alpha(V)beta(3) inhibited the adhesion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells to gB(RGD), while antibodies to alpha(3)beta(1) did not. Using affinity-purified integrins and confocal microscopy, alpha(V)beta(3) bound to gB(RGD) and KSHV virions, demonstrating direct receptor-ligand interactions. Specific alpha(V)beta(3) antagonists, including cyclic and dicyclic RGD peptides and alpha(V)beta(3) function-blocking antibodies, inhibited KSHV infection by 70 to 80%. Keratinocytes from alpha(3)-null mice lacking alpha(3)beta(1) were fully competent for infection by KSHV, and reconstitution of alpha(3)beta(1) function by transfection with alpha(3) cDNA reduced KSHV infectivity from 74% to 55%. Additional inhibitory effects of alpha(3)beta(1) on the cell surface expression of alpha(V)beta(3) and on alpha(V)beta(3)-mediated adhesion of alpha(3)-CHO cells overexpressing alpha(3)beta(1) were detected, consistent with previous reports of transdominant inhibition of alpha(V)beta(3) function by alpha(3)beta(1). These observations may explain previous reports of an inhibition of KSHV infection by soluble alpha(3)beta(1). Our studies demonstrate that alpha(V)beta(3) is a cellular receptor mediating both the cell adhesion and entry of KSHV into target cells through binding the virion-associated gB(RGD)."
15831101,Use of adenoviral E1A protein to analyze K18 promoter deregulation in colon carcinoma cells discloses a role for CtBP1 and BRCA1.,"The promoter of the keratin 18 (K18) gene is 5- to 10-fold more active in tumorigenic (T-type) cell clones derived from the SW613-S human colon carcinoma cell line than in non-tumorigenic (NT-type) clones. We have reported previously that the mechanism responsible for this differential activity is acting on the minimal K18 promoter (TATA box and initiation site). This mechanism does not require the binding of a factor to a specific site on the DNA but involves the acetylation of a non-histone substrate. To get further insight into this mechanism, we investigated the effect of the adenovirus E1A protein on the activity of the K18 promoter, both in T and NT cells."
23840900,Human DDX3 interacts with the HIV-1 Tat protein to facilitate viral mRNA translation.,"Nuclear export and translation of intron-containing viral mRNAs are required for HIV-1 gene expression and replication. In this report, we provide evidence to show that DDX3 regulates the translation of HIV-1 mRNAs. We found that knockdown of DDX3 expression effectively inhibited HIV-1 production. Translation of HIV-1 early regulatory proteins, Tat and rev, was impaired in DDX3-depleted cells. All HIV-1 transcripts share a highly structured 5' untranslated region (UTR) with inhibitory elements on translation of viral mRNAs, yet DDX3 promoted translation of reporter mRNAs containing the HIV-1 5' UTR, especially with the transactivation response (TAR) hairpin. Interestingly, DDX3 directly interacts with HIV-1 Tat, a well-characterized transcriptional activator bound to the TAR hairpin. HIV-1 Tat is partially targeted to cytoplasmic stress granules upon DDX3 overexpression or cell stress conditions, suggesting a potential role of Tat/DDX3 complex in translation. We further demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat remains associated with translating mRNAs and facilitates translation of mRNAs containing the HIV-1 5' UTR. Taken together, these findings indicate that DDX3 is recruited to the TAR hairpin by interaction with viral Tat to facilitate HIV-1 mRNA translation."
19164291,"TORC2, a coactivator of cAMP-response element-binding protein, promotes Epstein-Barr virus reactivation from latency through interaction with viral BZLF1 protein.","Reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus from latency is dependent on expression of the viral BZLF1 protein. The BZLF1 promoter (Zp) normally exhibits only low basal activity but is activated in response to chemical inducers such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and calcium ionophore. We found here that Transducer of Regulated cAMP-response Element-binding Protein (CREB) (TORC) 2 enhances Zp activity 10-fold and more than 100-fold with co-expression of the BZLF1 protein. Mutational analysis of Zp revealed that the activation by TORC is dependent on ZII and ZIII cis elements, binding sites for CREB family transcriptional factors and the BZLF1 protein, respectively. Immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter assay using Gal4-luc and Gal4BD-BZLF1 fusion protein indicate that TORC2 interacts with BZLF1, and that the complex is efficiently recruited onto Zp. These observations clearly indicate that TORC2 activates the promoter through interaction with the BZLF1 protein as well as CREB family transcriptional factors. Induction of the lytic replication resulted in the translocation of TORC2 from cytoplasm to viral replication compartments in nuclei, and furthermore, activation of Zp by TORC2 was augmented by calcium-regulated phosphatase, calcineurin. Silencing of endogenous TORC2 gene expression by RNA interference decreased the levels of the BZLF1 protein in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate/ionophore. Based on these results, we conclude that Epstein-Barr virus exploits the calcineurin-TORC signaling pathway through interactions between TORC and the BZLF1 protein in reactivation from latency."
22904686,The germinal center kinase TNIK is required for canonical NF-κB and JNK signaling in B-cells by the EBV oncoprotein LMP1 and the CD40 receptor.,"The tumor necrosis factor-receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) is a ubiquitously expressed member of the germinal center kinase family. The TNIK functions in hematopoietic cells and the role of TNIK-TRAF interaction remain largely unknown. By functional proteomics we identified TNIK as interaction partner of the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) signalosome in primary human B-cells infected with the Epstein-Barr tumor virus (EBV). RNAi-mediated knockdown proved a critical role for TNIK in canonical NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation by the major EBV oncoprotein LMP1 and its cellular counterpart, the B-cell co-stimulatory receptor CD40. Accordingly, TNIK is mandatory for proliferation and survival of EBV-transformed B-cells. TNIK forms an activation-induced complex with the critical signaling mediators TRAF6, TAK1/TAB2, and IKKβ, and mediates signalosome formation at LMP1. TNIK directly binds TRAF6, which bridges TNIK's interaction with the C-terminus of LMP1. Separate TNIK domains are involved in NF-κB and JNK signaling, the N-terminal TNIK kinase domain being essential for IKKβ/NF-κB and the C-terminus for JNK activation. We therefore suggest that TNIK orchestrates the bifurcation of both pathways at the level of the TRAF6-TAK1/TAB2-IKK complex. Our data establish TNIK as a novel key player in TRAF6-dependent JNK and NF-κB signaling and a transducer of activating and transforming signals in human B-cells."
26596467,Ubiquitin-specific protease 9X in host cells interacts with herpes simplex virus 1 ICP0.,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) expresses infected cell protein 0 (ICP0), a multi-functional protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and a critical regulator of the viral life cycle. To obtain novel insights into the molecular mechanism by which ICP0 regulates HSV-1 replication, we analyzed HEp-2 cells infected with HSV-1 by tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry-based proteomics. This screen identified 50 host-cell proteins that potentially interact with ICP0, including ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X). The interaction between ICP0 and USP9X was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Notably, USP9X depletion increased the ICP0 abundance and promoted viral replication. These results suggest that USP9X-dependent regulation of ICP0 expression is part of a complex feedback mechanism that facilitates optimal HSV-1 replication."
9218412,SH3-mediated Hck tyrosine kinase activation and fibroblast transformation by the Nef protein of HIV-1.,"Tyrosine kinases of the Src family are regulated via their Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains. The Nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has previously been shown to bind with high affinity and specificity in vitro to the SH3 domain of Hck, a Src family member expressed primarily in myeloid cells. However, the effect of Nef on Hck activity in living cells is unknown. Here we show that Rat-2 fibroblasts co-expressing Hck and Nef rapidly developed transformed foci, whereas control cells expressing either protein alone did not. Nef formed a stable complex with Hck and stimulated its tyrosine kinase activity in vivo. Mutagenesis of the Nef proline-rich motif essential for SH3 binding completely blocked complex formation, kinase activation, and transformation, indicating that the Nef SH3-binding function is required for its effects on Hck. These results provide direct evidence that SH3 engagement is sufficient to activate a Src family kinase in vivo and suggest that Hck may be activated by Nef in HIV-infected macrophages."
20823219,Targeting botulinum neurotoxin persistence by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most potent natural toxins known. The effects of BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A) can last several months, whereas the effects of BoNT serotype E (BoNT/E), which shares the same synaptic target, synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), last only several weeks. The long-lasting effects or persistence of BoNT/A, although desirable for therapeutic applications, presents a challenge for medical treatment of BoNT intoxication. Although the mechanisms for BoNT toxicity are well known, little is known about the mechanisms that govern the persistence of the toxins. We show that the recombinant catalytic light chain (LC) of BoNT/E is ubiquitylated and rapidly degraded in cells. In contrast, BoNT/A LC is considerably more stable. Differential susceptibility of the catalytic LCs to ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis therefore might explain the differential persistence of BoNT serotypes. In this regard we show that TRAF2, a RING finger protein implicated in ubiquitylation, selectively associates with BoNT/E LC and promotes its proteasomal degradation. Given these data, we asked whether BoNT/A LC could be targeted for rapid proteasomal degradation by redirecting it to characterized ubiquitin ligase domains. We describe chimeric SNAP25-based ubiquitin ligases that target BoNT/A LC for degradation, reducing its duration in a cellular model for toxin persistence."
26405230,DNA tumor virus oncogenes antagonize the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing pathway.,"Cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) detects intracellular DNA and signals through the adapter protein STING to initiate the antiviral response to DNA viruses. Whether DNA viruses can prevent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway remains largely unknown. Here, we identify the oncogenes of the DNA tumor viruses, including E7 from human papillomavirus (HPV) and E1A from adenovirus, as potent and specific inhibitors of the cGAS-STING pathway. We show that the LXCXE motif of these oncoproteins, which is essential for blockade of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, is also important for antagonizing DNA sensing. E1A and E7 bind to STING, and silencing of these oncogenes in human tumor cells restores the cGAS-STING pathway. Our findings reveal a host-virus conflict that may have shaped the evolution of viral oncogenes."
23328395,Paramyxovirus V proteins disrupt the fold of the RNA sensor MDA5 to inhibit antiviral signaling.,"The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) senses cytoplasmic viral RNA and activates antiviral innate immunity. To reveal how paramyxoviruses counteract this response, we determined the crystal structure of the MDA5 adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-hydrolysis domain in complex with the viral inhibitor V protein. The V protein unfolded the ATP-hydrolysis domain of MDA5 via a β-hairpin motif and recognized a structural motif of MDA5 that is normally buried in the conserved helicase fold. This leads to disruption of the MDA5 ATP-hydrolysis site and prevention of RNA-bound MDA5 filament formation. The structure explains why V proteins inactivate MDA5, but not RIG-I, and mutating only two amino acids in RIG-I induces robust V protein binding. Our results suggest an inhibition mechanism of RLR signalosome formation by unfolding of receptor and inhibitor."
16624878,Site-specific proteolysis of the transcriptional coactivator HCF-1 can regulate its interaction with protein cofactors.,"Limited proteolytic processing is an important transcriptional regulatory mechanism. In various contexts, proteolysis controls the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear transport of important transcription factors or removes domains to produce factors with altered activities. The transcriptional coactivator host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) is proteolytically processed within a unique domain consisting of 20-aa reiterations. Site-specific cleavage within one or more repeats generates a family of amino- and carboxyl-terminal subunits that remain tightly associated. However, the consequences of HCF-1 processing have been undefined. In this study, it was determined that the HCF-1-processing domain interacts with several proteins including the transcriptional coactivator/corepressor four-and-a-half LIM domain-2 (FHL2). Analysis of this interaction has uncovered specificity with both sequence and context determinants within the reiterations of this processing domain. In cells, FHL2 interacts exclusively with the nonprocessed coactivator and costimulates transcription of an HCF-1-dependent target gene. The functional interaction of HCF-1 with FHL2 supports a model in which site-specific proteolysis regulates the interaction of HCF-1 with protein partners and thus can modulate the activity of this coactivator. This paradigm expands the biological significance of limited proteolytic processing as a regulatory mechanism in gene transcription."
10607567,Identification of the Nef-associated kinase as p21-activated kinase 2.,"The Nef protein of primate immunodeficiency viruses plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [1] [2]. The interaction of Nef with the Nef-associated kinase (NAK) is one of the most conserved properties of different human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) Nef alleles. The role of NAK association is currently not known but it has been implicated in enhanced viral infectivity in cell culture and in disease progression in SIV-infected macaques [3]. Previous studies have indicated that NAK shares many features with the p21-activated kinases (PAKs) [3], but the molecular identity of NAK has remained unknown. We have generated specific antisera against PAKs 1-3, and expressed these kinases individually as epitope-tagged proteins. By using these reagents in experiments involving partial proteolytic mapping, and exploiting the unique ability of PAK2 to serve as a caspase substrate, we have positively identified NAK as PAK2. Interestingly, although ectopic PAK2 overexpression efficiently replaced endogenous PAK2 from the complex with Nef, the total Nef-associated PAK2 activity was not increased, indicating the abundance of another cellular factor(s) as the limiting factor in Nef-PAK2 complex formation. Identification of NAK as PAK2 should now facilitate elucidation of its role as a mediator of the pathogenic effects of Nef."
17189189,ChlR1 is required for loading papillomavirus E2 onto mitotic chromosomes and viral genome maintenance.,"Autonomously replicating DNA viruses must evade mitotic checkpoints and actively partition their genomes to maintain persistent infection. The E2 protein serves these functions by tethering papillomavirus episomes to mitotic chromosomes; however, the mechanism remains unresolved. We show that E2 binds ChlR1, a DNA helicase that plays a role in sister chromatid cohesion. The E2 mutation W130R fails to bind ChlR1 and correspondingly does not associate with mitotic chromosomes. Viral genomes encoding this E2 mutation are not episomally maintained in cell culture. Notably, E2 W130R binds Brd4, which reportedly acts as a mitotic tether, indicating this interaction is insufficient for E2 association with mitotic chromosomes. RNAi-induced depletion of ChlR1 significantly reduced E2 localization to mitotic chromosomes. These studies provide compelling evidence that ChlR1 association is required for loading the papillomavirus E2 protein onto mitotic chromosomes and represents a kinetochore-independent mechanism for viral genome maintenance and segregation."
16129689,"Interaction of the Epstein-Barr virus mRNA export factor EB2 with human Spen proteins SHARP, OTT1, and a novel member of the family, OTT3, links Spen proteins with splicing regulation and mRNA export.","The Epstein-Barr virus early protein EB2 (also called BMLF1, Mta, or SM), a protein absolutely required for the production of infectious virions, shares properties with mRNA export factors. By using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified the human protein OTT3 as an EB2-interacting factor. OTT3 is a new member of the Spen (split end) family of proteins (huSHARP, huOTT1, DmSpen, and muMINT), which are characterized by several N-terminal RNA recognition motifs and a highly conserved C-terminal SPOC (Spen Paralog and Ortholog C-terminal) domain that, in the case of SHARP, has been shown to interact with SMRT/NCoR corepressors. OTT3 is ubiquitously expressed as a 120-kDa protein. Transfected OTT3 is a nonshuttling nuclear protein that co-localizes with co-transfected EB2. We also showed that EB2 interacts with the SPOC domains of both OTT1 and SHARP proteins. Although the OTT3 interaction domain maps within the 40 N-terminal amino acids of EB2, OTT1 and SHARP interact within the C-terminal half of the protein. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the capacity of the OTT3 and OTT1 SPOC domains to interact with SMRT and repress transcription is far weaker than that of SHARP. Thus there is no evidence for a role of OTT3 in transcriptional regulation. Most interestingly, however, we have found that OTT3 has a role in splicing regulation; OTT3 represses accumulation of the alternatively spliced beta-thalassemia mRNAs, but it has no effect on the beta-globin constitutively spliced mRNA. Thus our results suggested a new function for Spen proteins related to mRNA export and splicing."
18086185,Binding of Dr adhesins of Escherichia coli to carcinoembryonic antigen triggers receptor dissociation.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) are host receptors for the Dr family of adhesins of Escherichia coli. To define the mechanism for binding of Dr adhesins to CEACAM receptors, we carried out structural studies on the N-terminal domain of CEA and its complex with the Dr adhesin. The crystal structure of CEA reveals a dimer similar to other dimers formed by receptors with IgV-like domains. The structure of the CEA/Dr adhesin complex is proposed based on NMR spectroscopy and mutagenesis data in combination with biochemical characterization. The Dr adhesin/CEA interface overlaps appreciably with the region responsible for CEA dimerization. Binding kinetics, mutational analysis and spectroscopic examination of CEA dimers suggest that Dr adhesins can dissociate CEA dimers prior to the binding of monomeric forms. Our conclusions include a plausible mechanism for how E. coli, and perhaps other bacterial and viral pathogens, exploit CEACAMs. The present structure of the complex provides a powerful tool for the design of novel inhibitory strategies to treat E. coli infections."
10438822,Functional analysis of human herpesvirus 8-encoded viral interferon regulatory factor 1 and its association with cellular interferon regulatory factors and p300.,"Human herpesvirus 8/Kaposi sarcoma-associated virus (HHV-8/KSHV) contains, in addition to genes required for viral replication, a unique set of nonstructural genes which may be part of viral mimicry and contribute to viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo. Among these, HHV-8 encodes four open reading frames (ORFs) that showed homology to the transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. The ORF K9, viral IRF 1 (vIRF-1), has been cloned, and it was shown that, when overexpressed, it down modulates the interferon-mediated transcriptional activation of the interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG 15) promoter, and the role of vIRF-1 in viral mimicry was implied. However, the molecular mechanism of this effect has not been clarified. Here, we extend this observation and show that vIRF-1 also downregulates the transcriptional activity of IFNA gene promoter in infected cells by interfering with the transactivating activity of cellular IRFs, including IRF-1 and IRF-3. We further show that ectopic expression of vIRF-1 in NIH 3T3 cells confers resistance to tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis. While vIRF-1 is unable to bind DNA with the same specificity as cellular IRFs, we demonstrate by in vitro binding assay that it can associate with the family of cellular IRFs, such as IRF-1 and the interferon consensus sequence binding protein. vIRF-1 interaction domain was localized between amino acids (aa) 152 and 243. While no binding between the full-size IRF-3 and vIRF-1 could be detected by the same assay, we show that vIRF-1 also targets the carboxy-terminal region (aa 1623 to 2414) of the transcriptional coactivator p300 which could also bind IRF-3 and IRF-1. These results demonstrate that vIRF-1 can modulate the transcription of the IFNA genes by direct heterodimerization with members of the IRF family, as well as by competitive binding with cellular transcription factors to the carboxy-terminal region of p300."
17137594,Identification of the LEDGF/p75 binding site in HIV-1 integrase.,"Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 is an important cellular co-factor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication. We originally identified LEDGF/p75 as a binding partner of integrase (IN) in human cells. The interaction has been mapped to the integrase-binding domain (IBD) of LEDGF/p75 located in the C-terminal part. We have subsequently shown that IN carrying the Q168A mutation remains enzymatically active but is impaired for interaction with LEDGF/p75. To map the integrase/LEDGF interface in more detail, we have now identified and characterized two regions within the enzyme involved in the interaction with LEDGF/p75. The first region centers around residues W131 and W132 while the second extends from I161 up to E170. For the different IN mutants the interaction with LEDGF/p75 and the enzymatic activities were determined. IN(W131A), IN(I161A), IN(R166A), IN(Q168A) and IN(E170A) are impaired for interaction with LEDGF/p75, but retain 3' processing and strand transfer activities. Due to impaired integration, an HIV-1 strain containing the W131A mutation in IN displays reduced replication capacity, whereas virus carrying IN(Q168A) is replication defective. Comparison of the wild-type IN-LEDGF/p75 co-crystal structure with that of the modelled structure of the IN(Q168A) and IN(W131A) mutant integrases corroborated our experimental data."
16983096,Recruitment of the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus LANA.,"The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus LANA protein is expressed in all Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-infected cells, including the tumor cells of endemic and AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and Castleman disease. LANA modulates cell gene expression, but the mechanisms of LANA-mediated transcriptional reprogramming are poorly understood. LANA-repressed cell genes were identified by using retroviral-transduced telomerase-immortalized microvascular endothelial cells. Transciptional repression of targeted genes was relieved by treatment with the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, suggesting a role for DNA methylation in repression. We found that LANA coprecipitated with DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) and recruited endogenous DNA methyltransferase activity from the cell extract. LANA preferentially relocalized Dnmt3a from the nuclear matrix into the chromatin fraction. Further, LANA associated with repressed cellular promoters, recruited Dnmt3a to DNA, and facilitated de novo promoter methylation of a down-regulated gene, cadherin 13 (H-cadherin). The data provide an example of promoter-specific epigenetic DNA modification through viral protein recruitment of de novo Dnmt activity."
25118280,Interaction of HIV-1 Nef protein with the host protein Alix promotes lysosomal targeting of CD4 receptor.,"Nef is an accessory protein of human immunodeficiency viruses that promotes viral replication and progression to AIDS through interference with various host trafficking and signaling pathways. A key function of Nef is the down-regulation of the coreceptor CD4 from the surface of the host cells. Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation involves at least two independent steps as follows: acceleration of CD4 endocytosis by a clathrin/AP-2-dependent pathway and targeting of internalized CD4 to multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for eventual degradation in lysosomes. In a previous work, we found that CD4 targeting to the MVB pathway was independent of CD4 ubiquitination. Here, we report that this targeting depends on a direct interaction of Nef with Alix/AIP1, a protein associated with the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery that assists with cargo recruitment and intraluminal vesicle formation in MVBs. We show that Nef interacts with both the Bro1 and V domains of Alix. Depletion of Alix or overexpression of the Alix V domain impairs lysosomal degradation of CD4 induced by Nef. In contrast, the V domain overexpression does not prevent cell surface removal of CD4 by Nef or protein targeting to the canonical ubiquitination-dependent MVB pathway. We also show that the Nef-Alix interaction occurs in late endosomes that are enriched in internalized CD4. Together, our results indicate that Alix functions as an adaptor for the ESCRT-dependent, ubiquitin-independent targeting of CD4 to the MVB pathway induced by Nef."
16381817,The E7 proteins of low- and high-risk human papillomaviruses share the ability to target the pRB family member p130 for degradation.,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) (e.g., HPV-16) cause anogenital and head and neck cancers, and low-risk HPVs (e.g., HPV-6) cause benign hyperproliferative disease. The E7 protein of HPV-16 binds all retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) family members with higher affinity than HPV-6E7. The HPV-16 E7 protein has been reported to target pRB family members for degradation and to immortalize cells. Here we tested the hypothesis that the low-risk E7 protein has an intrinsic ability to decrease expression of pRB family members. First, we introduced a high-affinity pRB-binding site into HPV-6 E7 (6E7G22D) and showed that, in human foreskin keratinocytes, HPV-6 E7G22D decreased the level of pRB protein but not pRB mRNA. Second, we analyzed the ability of wild-type HPV-6 E7 to destabilize the other pRB family members, p107 and p130. HPV-6 E7, like HPV-16 E7, decreased the level of p130 protein. This decrease was inhibited by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Binding of HPV-6 E7 to p130 was necessary but not sufficient to decrease the level of p130. Furthermore, the destabilization of p130 correlated with a decrease in the expression of involucrin, a differentiation marker. We suggest that the shared activity of HPV-16 E7 and HPV-6 E7 to destabilize p130 and decrease or delay differentiation may be related to the role of E7 in the HPV life cycle. The added ability of HPV-16 E7 to regulate pRB and p107 may be related to oncogenic activity."
16581912,A chemokine-binding domain in the tumor necrosis factor receptor from variola (smallpox) virus.,"Variola virus (VaV) is the causative agent of smallpox, one of the most devastating diseases encountered by man, that was eradicated in 1980. The deliberate release of VaV would have catastrophic consequences on global public health. However, the mechanisms that contribute to smallpox pathogenesis are poorly understood at the molecular level. The ability of viruses to evade the host defense mechanisms is an important determinant of viral pathogenesis. Here we show that the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) homologue CrmB encoded by VaV functions not only as a soluble decoy TNFR but also as a highly specific binding protein for several chemokines that mediate recruitment of immune cells to mucosal surfaces and the skin, sites of virus entry and viral replication at late stages of smallpox. CrmB binds chemokines through its C-terminal domain, which is unrelated to TNFRs, was named smallpox virus-encoded chemokine receptor (SECRET) domain and uncovers a family of poxvirus chemokine inhibitors. An active SECRET domain was found in another viral TNFR (CrmD) and three secreted proteins encoded by orthopoxviruses. These findings identify a previously undescribed chemokine-binding and inhibitory domain unrelated to host chemokine receptors and a mechanism of immune modulation in VaV that may influence smallpox pathogenesis."
17085597,Structural basis for protein-protein interactions in the 14-3-3 protein family.,"The seven members of the human 14-3-3 protein family regulate a diverse range of cell signaling pathways by formation of protein-protein complexes with signaling proteins that contain phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues within specific sequence motifs. Previously, crystal structures of three 14-3-3 isoforms (zeta, sigma, and tau) have been reported, with structural data for two isoforms deposited in the Protein Data Bank (zeta and sigma). In this study, we provide structural detail for five 14-3-3 isoforms bound to ligands, providing structural coverage for all isoforms of a human protein family. A comparative structural analysis of the seven 14-3-3 proteins revealed specificity determinants for binding of phosphopeptides in a specific orientation, target domain interaction surfaces and flexible adaptation of 14-3-3 proteins through domain movements. Specifically, the structures of the beta isoform in its apo and peptide bound forms showed that its binding site can exhibit structural flexibility to facilitate binding of its protein and peptide partners. In addition, the complex of 14-3-3 beta with the exoenzyme S peptide displayed a secondary structural element in the 14-3-3 peptide binding groove. These results show that the 14-3-3 proteins are adaptable structures in which internal flexibility is likely to facilitate recognition and binding of their interaction partners."
10199403,Nef-induced CD4 degradation: a diacidic-based motif in Nef functions as a lysosomal targeting signal through the binding of beta-COP in endosomes.,"The Nef protein of primate lentiviruses downregulates the cell surface expression of CD4 through a two-step process. First, Nef connects the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 with adaptor protein complexes (AP), thereby inducing the formation of CD4-specific clathrin-coated pits that rapidly endocytose the viral receptor. Second, Nef targets internalized CD4 molecules for degradation. Here we show that Nef accomplishes this second task by acting as a connector between CD4 and the beta subunit of COPI coatomers in endosomes. A sequence encompassing a critical acidic dipeptide, located nearby but distinct from the AP-binding determinant of HIV-1 Nef, is responsible for beta-COP recruitment and for routing to lysosomes. A novel class of endosomal sorting motif, based on acidic residues, is thus revealed, and beta-COP is identified as its downstream partner."
9882344,Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor amino-terminal immunoglobulin V-related domain binds adenovirus type 2 and fiber knob from adenovirus type 12.,"The extracellular region of the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is predicted to consist of two immunoglobulin (Ig)-related structural domains. We expressed the isolated CAR amino-terminal domain (D1) and a CAR fragment containing both extracellular Ig domains (D1/D2) in Escherichia coli. Both D1 and D1/D2 formed complexes in vitro with the recombinant knob domain of adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) fiber, and D1 inhibited adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) infection of HeLa cells. These results indicate that the adenovirus-binding activity of CAR is localized in the amino-terminal IgV-related domain and confirm our earlier observation that Ad2 and Ad12 bind to the same cellular receptor. Preliminary crystallization studies suggest that complexes of Ad12 knob bound to D1 will be suitable for structure determination."
8105392,A nuclear localization signal within HIV-1 matrix protein that governs infection of non-dividing cells.,"Permissiveness of the host cell to productive infection by oncoretroviruses is cell-cycle dependent, and nuclear localization of viral nucleoprotein preintegration complexes will occur only after cells have passed through mitosis. In contrast, establishment of an integrated provirus after infection by the lentivirus HIV-1 is independent of host cell proliferation. The ability of HIV-1 to replicate in non-dividing cells is partly accounted for by the karyophilic properties of the viral preintegration complex which, after virus infection, is actively transported to the host cell nucleus. Here we report that the gag matrix protein of HIV-1 contains a nuclear localization sequence which, when conjugated to a heterologous protein, directs its nuclear import. In addition, HIV-1 mutants containing amino-acid substitutions in this nuclear localization signal integrate and replicate within dividing but not growth-arrested cells, and thus display a phenotype more representative of an oncoretrovirus."
12370808,Functional interaction of Sam68 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K.,"Sam68 is a target of the c-Src tyrosine kinase. We previously showed that overexpression of Sam68 functionally substitutes for, as well as synergies with, HIV-1 Rev in Rev-response element (RRE)-mediated gene expression and virus replication. Here we describe the identification of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) as a protein that specifically interacts with Sam68 in vitro and in vivo. HnRNP K did not bind to RRE-RNA directly, but formed a super complex with Sam68 and RRE in vitro. RNase treatment did not change the strength of binding of hnRNP K to Sam68. We demonstrated that hnRNP K significantly inhibited Sam68-mediated, but not Rev-mediated, RRE-dependent gene expression. We further showed that Sam68, but not a non-functional mutant Sam68p21, inhibited transcriptional activation of CT element by hnRNP K. Interestingly, the Sam68p21 with a single amino acid substitution in the nuclear localization domain exhibited less affinity for hnRNP K in vitro. We propose that the direct interaction of Sam68 and hnRNP K adversely affect the activities of both proteins in signal transduction pathways of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events."
11238447,Cofactor requirements for nuclear export of Rev response element (RRE)- and constitutive transport element (CTE)-containing retroviral RNAs. An unexpected role for actin.,"Nuclear export of proteins containing leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NESs) is mediated by the export receptor CRM1/exportin1. However, additional protein factors interacting with leucine-rich NESs have been described. Here, we investigate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev-mediated nuclear export and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) constitutive transport element (CTE)-mediated nuclear export in microinjected Xenopus laevis oocytes. We show that eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) is essential for Rev and Rev-mediated viral RNA export, but not for nuclear export of CTE RNA. In vitro binding studies demonstrate that eIF-5A is required for efficient interaction of Rev-NES with CRM1/exportin1 and that eIF-5A interacts with the nucleoporins CAN/nup214, nup153, nup98, and nup62. Quite unexpectedly, nuclear actin was also identified as an eIF-5A binding protein. We show that actin is associated with the nucleoplasmic filaments of nuclear pore complexes and is critically involved in export processes. Finally, actin- and energy-dependent nuclear export of HIV-1 Rev is reconstituted by using a novel in vitro egg extract system. In summary, our data provide evidence that actin plays an important functional role in nuclear export not only of retroviral RNAs but also of host proteins such as protein kinase inhibitor (PKI)."
9847314,Nucleoporins nup98 and nup214 participate in nuclear export of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is essential for its nucleocytoplasmic export mediated by hCRM1. We examined the role of selected nucleoporins, which are located in peripheral structures of the nuclear pore complex and are thought to be involved in export, in Rev function in human cells. First, we found that upon actinomycin D treatment, Nup98, but not Nup214 or Nup153, is able to translocate to the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, demonstrating that Nup98 may act as a soluble factor. We further showed that Rev can recruit Nup98 and Nup214, but not Nup153, to the nucleolus. We also found that the isolated FG-containing repeat domains of Nup98 and Nup214, but not those of Nup153, competitively inhibit the Rev/RRE-mediated expression of HIV. Taken together, the recruitment of Nup98 and Nup214 by Rev and the competitive inhibition exhibited by their NP domains demonstrate direct participation of Nup98 and Nup214 in the Rev-hCRM1-mediated export."
7505766,Expression of (cac)n/(gtg)n simple repetitive sequences in mRNA of human lymphocytes.,"Di- and trinucleotide tandem repeat sequences are ubiquitously interspersed and are often polymorphic in the human genome. We have analyzed the transcription of simple (cac)n/(gtg)n repeats in the cDNA of RNA from human lymphocytes. When using such motifs as probes in RNA hybridization experiments, distinct signals are scarcely demonstrable. In order to investigate mRNA sequences that contain such simple repeats, 1 million phage clones from cDNA libraries were screened with the probe (CAC)5. From 50 hybridizing phages, 38 clones were successfully isolated and characterized. The lengths of the transcripts ranged from 120 bp to 3.5 kb. More than 15 different additional simple repeat motifs were found immediately next to or distant to the (cac)n/(gtg)n repeat. In 12 clones, significant homologies were identified with a wide variety of unrelated genes, such as a processed pseudogene of human ubiquitin, serin protease inhibitor genes, a gene candidate from yeast, and sequence-tagged sites of man and mouse. Of the clones, 18% represented mRNA of MHC class I promotor binding protein; 79% displayed novel single copy sequences or partial similarity to many different organelle and nuclear genomes of animal, fungal, bacterial, and viral sequences. These data indicate that short (cac)n/(gtg)n stretches (n < or = 6) are sometimes contained in open reading frames, but more often in the 3' and 5' untranslated portions of mature mRNAs. Longer stretches of perfect simple (cac)n/(gtg)n repeats can rarely be recovered, even from the hnRNA of human lymphocytes."
1385321,The antigen-specific induction of normal human lymphocytes in vitro is down-regulated by a conserved HIV p24 epitope.,"Synthetic peptides containing amino acid sequence 218-238 of the core protein p24 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and progressively shorter sequences at its C-terminus, were tested for their effect on antigen dependent in vitro responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from normal human donors. A peptide as short as 7 amino acids, corresponding to a highly conserved sequence, was able to inhibit in a dose-dependent manner the induction of a specific primary antibody response to the sheep red cell (SRC) antigen, as well as the proliferative response to recall microbial antigens. The results of this study constitute additional evidence of the immunoinhibitory effects of HIV components and may help to unravel some of the pathogenic mechanisms of AIDS. Moreover, they are of potential relevance for the development of immunoprophylactic and therapeutic strategies."
7517794,An HIV p24 heptapeptide down-regulates antigen-specific responses in vitro interfering at the level of the T3-Ti complex.,"Ch7 (RGSDIAG), a synthetic heptapeptide derived from a conserved region of HIV p24 (aa 232-238), was previously shown to suppress antigen-induced responses in cultures of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). We show in this paper that Ch7 is the shortest peptide retaining full inhibitory capacity. Further, the peptide inhibited efficiently and in a dose-dependent manner the induction of a specific antibody response to the antigens SRC (sheep red cells) and Candida albicans but did not exert any effect on the induction of immunoglobulin-secreting cells in PWM-stimulated cultures. Finally, Ch7 inhibited anti-CD3-induced lymphoproliferation but did not affect anti-CD2 activation. These results suggest that a conserved epitope of HIV p24 may be able to prevent the induction of antigen-specific antibody responses by interfering with lymphocyte activation via the T3-Ti complex, resulting in the abrogation of immune functions that are defective in HIV-infected individuals."
8809126,Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) can counteract the in vitro inhibitory effect of an HIV p24 immunosuppressive heptapeptide.,"Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a synthetic heptapeptide (Ch7), corresponding to a conserved sequence of HIV core protein p24 (aa 232-238), was able to specifically abrogate antigen-induced responses in cultures of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). In the present study we show that Ch7 did not inhibit the induction of IFN-gamma-secreting cells nor the accumulation of IFN-gamma mRNA in antigen-stimulated cultures. However, delayed addition of recombinant human IFN-gamma to Ch7-suppressed cultures was able to restore fully the capacity to mount an antigen-specific antibody response. Thus, although the Ch7 immunosuppressive effect may not be directly related to a decreased production of IFN-gamma, an increased level of this cytokine is certainly able to counteract the negative effect of the peptide."
15710476,Cooperative interaction of C/EBP beta and Tat modulates MCP-1 gene transcription in astrocytes.,"The chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is one of the most potent monocyte chemoattractants whose level is elevated during the course of AIDS dementia. Earlier studies showed that HIV-1 Tat protein is able to induce transcription of the MCP-1 promoter in astrocytic cells. Furthermore, the TGFbeta-1 signaling pathway through its regulatory proteins, Smads, modulates Tat activation of MCP-1. Here, we demonstrate that C/EBPbeta, whose activity is enhanced by a variety of cytokines during the course of viral infection, can stimulate basal- and Tat-mediated transcription of MCP-1 in human astrocytic cells. Results using promoter deletion mutants suggested the importance of multiple C/EBPbeta binding sites scattered within -200 to +1 of the MCP-1 promoter in the observed activity. Results from DNA binding studies have shown that the interaction of C/EBPbeta with its DNA motif is diminished by the C/EBPbeta homologous protein, CHOP, which possesses the ability to suppress the stimulatory effect of C/EBPbeta on MCP-1 transcription. Tat, which possesses the ability to interact with C/EBPbeta, alleviates the negative effect of CHOP and restores C/EBPbeta interaction with the DNA. Furthermore, Smad3 and its C-terminal regulatory motif, MH2, interact with C/EBPbeta and modulate its DNA binding and transcriptional activity on the MCP-1 promoter. Our results show that the physical and functional interactions of C/EBPbeta and Tat are severely affected by the presence of Smad3 and MH2. Altogether, these observations identify C/EBPbeta as a new partner for Tat in stimulating MCP-1 transcription in astrocytes and suggest that the delicate balance among the downstream regulatory proteins of several cytokines and immunomodulators can dictate the level of expression of chemoattractants, including MCP-1. Hence, inappropriate expression and function of regulatory proteins such as C/EBPbeta and Smads by Tat may induce MCP-1 production in astrocytes and contribute to the neuropathogenesis of AIDS through stimulation of inflammation in the CNS."
10908577,HIV-1 rev depolymerizes microtubules to form stable bilayered rings.,"We describe a novel interaction between HIV-1 Rev and microtubules (MTs) that results in the formation of bilayered rings that are 44-49 nm in external diameter, 3.4-4.2 MD (megadaltons) in mass, and have 28-, 30-, or 32-fold symmetry. Ring formation is not sensitive to taxol, colchicine, or microtubule-associated proteins, but requires Mg(2+) and is inhibited by maytansine. The interaction involves the NH(2)-terminal domain of Rev and the face of tubulin exposed on the exterior of the MTs. The NH(2)-terminal half of Rev has unexpected sequence similarity to the tubulin-binding portion of the catalytic/motor domains of the microtubule-destabilizing Kin I kinesins. We propose a model wherein binding of Rev dimers to MTs at their ends causes segments of two neighboring protofilaments to peel off and close into rings, circumferentially containing 14, 15, or 16 tubulin heterodimers, with Rev bound on the inside. Rev has a strong inhibitory effect on aster formation in Xenopus egg extracts, demonstrating that it can interact with tubulin in the presence of normal levels of cellular constituents. These results suggest that Rev may interact with MTs to induce their destabilization, a proposition consistent with the previously described disruption of MTs after HIV-1 infection."
1978848,"HIV inhibits the early steps of lymphocyte activation, including initiation of inositol phospholipid metabolism.","Mechanisms accounting for HIV-associated suppression of lymphocyte proliferation were investigated. In previous work we demonstrated that purified and inactivated HIV-suppressed lymphoid cell proliferation. In this report we used an inactivated preparation of HIV obtained from infected CEM cells grown in serum free media and demonstrated that this HIV-associated suppression acted in the early steps of activation to inhibit the incorporation of radiolabeled phosphorus into phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. Initially we showed that both purified CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte subsets were affected and HIV-associated inhibition did not require the CD4 molecule. Impaired lymphocyte blastogenesis (decreased size and granularity and decreased expression of receptors to IL-2 and transferrin) in response to PHA indicated an effect of inactivated HIV on the early steps of activation. This was confirmed by time studies where 1) a 2 min HIV-pretreatment followed by washing before stimulation was sufficient to inhibit PHA induced proliferation of normal lymphocytes, and 2) addition of HIV to PHA prestimulated lymphocytes failed to inhibit proliferation, e.g., there was no effect on preactivated lymphocytes. HIV was mainly inhibitory of lymphocyte proliferation induced by PHA or mAb to the CD3 receptor. In contrast to the effect on the CD3/TiR, responses via the CD2 receptor were not suppressed, e.g., stimulation with the monoclonal antibodies T11(2) + T11(3). Inasmuch as responses by direct A23187 + PMA stimulation of intracellular pathways were also inhibited, it appears that the HIV-induced defect was not (or not only) membrane receptor mediated. The earliest (min) measurable event after stimulation was the initial increase in intracellular Ca2+ which was unaffected by HIV pretreatment. The next measurable event (min to h) of stimulation is a sustained increase in inositol phospholipid turnover. Pretreatment of mononuclear cells with inactivated HIV resulted in a decreased inositol phospholipid turnover as judged from decreased 32P incorporation into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. This led to decreased generation of DAG as reflected in the reduced radiolabeling of its metabolite PA. Reduced availability of DAG presumably interferes with pkC activation and leads to decreased expression of receptors for IL-2 and transferrin and impaired proliferation."
9188609,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 preintegration complexes: studies of organization and composition.,"We have investigated the organization and function of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) preintegration complexes (PICs), the large nucleoprotein particles that carry out cDNA integration in vivo. PICs can be isolated from HIV-1-infected cells, and such particles are capable of carrying out integration reactions in vitro. We find that although the PICs are large, the cDNA must be condensed to fit into the measured volume. The ends of the cDNA are probably linked by a protein bridge, since coordinated joining of the two ends is not disrupted by cleaving the cDNA internally with a restriction enzyme. cDNA ends in PICs were protected from digestion by added exonucleases, probably due to binding of proteins. The intervening cDNA, in contrast, was susceptible to attack by endonucleases. Previous work has established that the virus-encoded integrase protein is present in PICs, and we have reported recently that the host protein HMG I(Y) is also present. Here we report that the viral matrix and reverse transcriptase (RT) proteins also cofractionated with PICs through several steps whereas capsid and nucleocapsid proteins dissociated. These data support a model of PIC organization in which the cDNA is condensed in a partially disassembled remnant of the viral core, with proteins tightly associated at the apposed cDNA ends but loosely associated with the intervening cDNA. In characterizing the structure of the cDNA ends, we found that the U5 DNA ends created by RT were ragged, probably due to the terminal transferase activity of RT. Only molecules correctly cleaved by integrase protein at the 3' ends were competent to integrate, suggesting that one role for terminal cleavage by integrase may be to create a defined end at otherwise heterogeneous cDNA termini."
9020149,Differential expression and sequence-specific interaction of karyopherin alpha with nuclear localization sequences.,"The process of nuclear protein transport requires the interaction of several different proteins, either directly or indirectly with nuclear localization or targeting sequences (NLS). Recently, a number of karyopherins alpha, or NLS-binding proteins, have been identified. We have found that the karyopherins hSRP1 and hSRP1alpha are differentially expressed in various leukocyte cell lines and could be induced in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. We show that the two karyopherins bind with varied specificities in a sequence specific manner to different NLSs and that the sequence specificity is modulated by other cytosolic proteins. There was a correlation between binding of karyopherins alpha to different NLSs and their ability to be imported into the nucleus. Taken together, these data provide evidence for multiple levels of control of the nuclear import process."
9400595,Interactions between Tat of HIV-2 and transcription factor Sp1.,"Tat of HIV-2 (Tat-2) requires host cellular factors for optimal function. We show that transactivation by Tat-2 of the HIV promoter requires cis-acting binding sites for Sp1 or Sp1 brought to the promoter via a heterologous system. We demonstrate that an activation domain in Tat-2 consists of one of two potential alpha-helices in the amino-terminal region, the cysteine-rich region, and the core region and that this independent activation domain requires cis-acting Sp1-binding sites for function. Tat-2 interacts with Sp1 in in vitro binding assays, and these interactions require basic residues outside of the Tat-2 activation domain. The regions in Sp1 sufficient for functional synergy with Tat are the Sp1 activation domains, while the DNA-binding region is dispensable. Substitution mutations of a glutamine-rich region in one Sp1 activation domain, which eliminate interactions with a TBP-associated factor, also significantly decrease synergy with Tat. Thus, the functional synergy between Tat-2 and Sp1 localizes to domains in each activator that interact with components of the transcription complex. We suggest that these interactions, rather than direct Tat/Sp1 binding, result in highly processive RNA polymerase II complexes and full-length viral transcripts."
11932435,Specific incorporation of heat shock protein 70 family members into primate lentiviral virions.,"To determine if any heat shock proteins are incorporated into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions in a manner similar to that of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A, we probed purified virions with antibodies against heat shock proteins Hsp27, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsc70, and Hsp90. Of these proteins, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsc70 associated with virions purified based on either particle density or size and were shown to be incorporated within the virion membrane, where they were protected from digestion by exogenous protease. Virion incorporation of Hsp70 was also observed with HIV-2 and with simian immunodeficiency viruses SIV(MAC) and SIV(AGM), but it appears to be specific for primate lentiviruses, since Hsp70 was not detected in association with Moloney murine leukemia virus virions. Of the HIV-1 genes, gag was found to be sufficient for Hsp70 incorporation, though Hsp70 was roughly equimolar with pol-encoded proteins in virions."
9971769,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease triggers a myristoyl switch that modulates membrane binding of Pr55(gag) and p17MA.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Pr55(gag) gene product directs the assembly of virions at the inner surface of the cell plasma membrane. The specificity of plasma membrane binding by Pr55(gag) is conferred by a combination of an N-terminal myristoyl moiety and a basic residue-rich domain. Although the myristate plus basic domain is also present in the p17MA proteolytic product formed upon Pr55(gag) maturation, the ability of p17MA to bind to membranes is significantly reduced. It was previously reported that the reduced membrane binding of p17MA was due to sequestration of the myristate moiety by a myristoyl switch (W. Zhou and M. D. Resh, J. Virol. 70:8540-8548, 1996). Here we demonstrate directly that treatment of membrane-bound Pr55(gag) in situ with HIV-1 protease generates p17MA, which is then released from the membrane. Pr55(gag) was synthesized in reticulocyte lysates, bound to membranes, and incubated with purified HIV-1 protease. The p17MA product in the membrane-bound and soluble fractions was analyzed following proteolysis. Newly generated p17MA initially was membrane bound but then displayed a slow, time-dependent dissociation resulting in 65% solubilization. Residual p17MA could be extracted from the membranes with either high pH or high salt. Treatment of membranes from transfected COS-1 cells with protease revealed that Pr55(gag) was present within sealed membrane vesicles and that the release of p17MA occurred only when detergent and salt were added. We present a model proposing that the HIV-1 protease is the ""trigger"" for a myristoyl switch mechanism that modulates the membrane associations of Pr55(gag) and p17MA in virions and membranes."
17341665,Hsp72 up-regulates Epstein-Barr virus EBNALP coactivation with EBNA2.,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transcriptional coactivator EBNALP specifically associates and colocalizes with Hsp72 in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We now find that overexpression of Hsp72 more than doubled EBNALP coactivation with EBNA2 of a transfected EBV LMP1 promoter in B lymphoblasts, did not affect EBNA2 or EBNALP protein levels, and strongly up-regulated EBNA2 and EBNALP coactivation of LMP1 protein expression from the endogenous EBV genome in latency I infected Akata cells. The Hsp72 ATP, protein binding, and the C-terminal regulatory domains were required for full activity. An EBNALP deletion mutant, EBNALPd45, which does not associate with Hsp72, coactivated with EBNA2, but was not affected by Hsp72 overexpression, despite Hsp72 up-regulation of wild-type EBNALP coactivation with EBNA2 at all levels of EBNALP expression, indicating the importance of Hsp72 association with EBNALP for Hsp72 up-regulation of coactivation. Of importance, a 90% RNAi knockdown of Hsp72 reduced EBNALP coactivation with EBNA2 of transfected EBV LMP1 and Cp promoters by approximately 50%. Overexpression of the Hsp72 C-terminal interacting and regulatory protein, CHIP, strongly down-regulated EBNALP coactivation, independently of CHIP ubiquitin ligase activity. CHIP effects were Hsp72 dependent, indicating a background downmodulating role for CHIP in Hsp72 augmentation of EBNA2 and EBNALP coactivation. Based on these and other cited data, we favor a model in which Hsp72 chaperones EBNALP shuttling of repressors from EBNA2-enhanced promoters."
24422669,HIV-1 Vif N-terminal motif is required for recruitment of Cul5 to suppress APOBEC3.,"HIV-1 Vif promotes the degradation of host anti-retroviral factor family, APOBEC3 proteins via the recruitment of a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The complex is composed of a scaffold protein, Cullin 5 (Cul5), RING-box protein (Rbx), a SOCS box binding protein complex, Elongins B/C (Elo B/C), as well as newly identified host co-factor, core binding factor beta (CBF-β). Cul5 has previously been shown to bind amino acids within an HCCH domain as well as a PPLP motif at the C-terminus of Vif; however, it is unclear whether Cul5 binding requires additional regions of the Vif polypeptide."
24390335,Evolutionarily conserved requirement for core binding factor beta in the assembly of the human immunodeficiency virus/simian immunodeficiency virus Vif-cullin 5-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-encoded virion infectivity factor (Vif) is required to inactivate the host restriction factor APOBEC3 by engaging Cullin 5 (Cul5)-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL5). Core binding factor beta (CBF-β) is a novel regulator of Vif-CRL5 function; as yet, its mechanism of regulation remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that CBF-β promotion of Vif-CRL5 assembly is independent of its influence on Vif stability and is also a conserved feature of primate lentiviral Vif proteins. Furthermore, CBF-β is critical for the formation of the Vif-ElonginB/ElonginC-Cul5 core E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in vitro. CBF-β from diverse vertebrate species supported HIV-1 Vif function, indicating the conserved nature of Vif-CBF-β interfaces. Considering the importance of the interaction between Vif and CBF-β in viral CRL5 function, disrupting this interaction represents an attractive pharmacological intervention against HIV-1."
24390320,Core binding factor beta plays a critical role by facilitating the assembly of the Vif-cullin 5 E3 ubiquitin ligase.,"The HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif) targets the cellular cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) for degradation via the host ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Vif recruits a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase to polyubiquitinate A3G/F. The activity of Vif critically depends on the cellular core binding factor beta (CBFβ). In this study, we investigated the Vif-CBFβ interaction and the role of CBFβ in the E3 ligase assembly. Vif-CBFβ interaction requires an extensive region of Vif spanning most of its amino terminus and zinc finger region, and cullin 5 (Cul5) binding enhances the stability of the Vif-CBFβ interaction. Our results further demonstrate that CBFβ plays a critical role in facilitating Cul5 binding to the Vif/elongin B/elongin C complex. Vif, with or without bound substrate, is unable to bind Cul5 in the absence of CBFβ. These studies support the notion that CBFβ serves as a molecular chaperone to facilitate Vif-E3 ligase assembly."
24810617,Identification of HIV-1 Vif regions required for CBF-β interaction and APOBEC3 suppression.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif requires core binding factor β (CBF-β) to degrade the host APOBEC3 restriction factors. Although a minimum domain and certain amino acids of HIV-1 Vif, including hydrophobic residues at the N-terminal, have been identified as critical sites for binding with CBF-β, other regions that potentially mediate this interaction need to be further investigated. Here, we mapped two new regions of HIV-1 Vif that are required for interaction with CBF-β by generating a series of single-site or multiple-site Vif mutants and testing their effect on the suppression of APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F). A number of the mutants, including G84A/SIEW86-89AAAA (84/86-89), E88A/W89A (88/89), G84A, W89A, L106S and I107S in the 84GxSIEW89 and L102ADQLI107 regions, affected Vif function by disrupting CBF-β binding. These Vif mutants also had altered interactions with CUL5, since CBF-β is known to facilitate the binding of Vif to CUL5. We further showed that this effect was not due to misfolding or conformational changes in Vif, as the mutants still maintained their interactions with other factors such as ElonginB, A3G and A3F. Notably, G84D and D104A had stronger effects on the Vif-CUL5 interaction than on the Vif-CBF-β interaction, indicating that they mainly influenced the CUL5 interaction and implying that the interaction of Vif with CUL5 contributes to the binding of Vif to CBF-β. These new binding interfaces with CBF-β in HIV-1 Vif provide novel targets for the development of HIV-1 inhibitors."
17159145,Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen leader protein coactivates transcription through interaction with histone deacetylase 4.,"Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) leader protein (EBNALP) coactivates promoters with EBNA2 and is important for Epstein-Barr virus immortalization of B cells. Investigation of the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in EBNALP and EBNA2 promoter regulation has now identified EBNALP and EBNA2 to be associated with HDAC4 in a lymphoblastoid cell line. Furthermore, a transcription-deficient EBNALP point mutant did not associate with HDAC4. HDAC4 and 5 overexpression repressed EBNA2 activation and EBNALP coactivation, whereas other HDACs had little effect. Moreover, EBNALP expression decreased nuclear HDAC4. Expression of 14-3-3 anchors HDAC4 in the cytoplasm, increased EBNALP effects, and reversed HDAC4 or 5 repression. HDAC4 reversal depended on the HDAC4 nuclear export sequence. Consistent with EBNALP coactivation being mediated by nuclear HDAC4 depletion, HDAC4 overexpression increased nuclear HDAC4 and specifically repressed EBNA2-dependent activation as well as EBNALP-dependent coactivation. Also, EBNALP, HDAC4, and 14-3-3 could be immunoprecipitated in a single complex. Thus, these data strongly support a model in which EBNALP coactivates transcription by relocalizing HDAC4 and 5 from EBNA2 activated promoters to the cytoplasm. The observed EBNALP effects are likely also in part through HDAC5, which is highly homologous to HDAC4."
17239418,Identification of a cytoplasmic interaction partner of the large regulatory proteins Rep78/Rep68 of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2).,"Through yeast two-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation studies, we have identified a novel cellular AAV-2 Rep78/Rep68 interaction partner located predominantly in the cytoplasm. In public databases, it has been assigned as KCTD5, because of a region of high similarity to the cytoplasmic tetramerization domain of voltage-gated potassium channels. Whereas Rep/KCTD5 interaction relied on the region surrounding the Rep nuclear localization signal, nuclear accumulation of Rep was not required. Wildtype Rep78/Rep68 proteins induced the translocation of large portions of KCTD5 into the nucleus pointing to functional interactions both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In line with an anticipated functional interference in the cytoplasm, KCTD5 overexpression completely abrogated Rep68-mediated posttranscriptional activation of a HIV-LTR driven luciferase reporter gene. Our study expands the panel of already identified nuclear Rep interaction partners to a cytoplasmic protein, which raises the awareness that important steps in the AAV life cycle may be regulated in this compartment."
19966293,Functions of the unique N-terminal region of glycoprotein E in the pathogenesis of varicella-zoster virus infection.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an alphaherpesvirus that infects skin, lymphocytes, and sensory ganglia. VZV glycoprotein E (gE) has a unique N-terminal region (aa1-188), which is required for replication and includes domains involved in secondary envelopment, efficient cell-cell spread, and skin infection in vivo. The nonconserved N-terminal region also mediates binding to the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which is proposed to be a VZV receptor. Using viral mutagenesis to make the recombinant rOka-DeltaP27-G90, we showed that amino acids in this region are required for gE/IDE binding in infected cells; this deletion reduced cell-cell spread in vitro and skin infection in vivo. However, a gE point mutation, linker insertions, and partial deletions in the aa27-90 region, and deletion of a large portion of the unique N-terminal region, aa52-187, had similar or more severe effects on VZV replication in vitro and in vivo without disrupting the gE/IDE interaction. VZV replication in T cells in vivo was not impaired by deletion of gE aa27-90, suggesting that these gE residues are not essential for VZV T cell tropism. However, the rOka-DeltaY51-P187 mutant failed to replicate in T cell xenografts as well as skin in vivo. VZV tropism for T cells and skin, which is necessary for its life cycle in the human host, requires this nonconserved region of the N-terminal region of VZV gE."
20133580,"Genome-wide siRNA screen identifies SMCX, EP400, and Brd4 as E2-dependent regulators of human papillomavirus oncogene expression.","An essential step in the pathogenesis of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers is the dysregulated expression of the viral oncogenes. The papillomavirus E2 protein can silence the long control region (LCR) promoter that controls viral E6 and E7 oncogene expression. The mechanisms by which E2 represses oncogene expression and the cellular factors through which E2 mediates this silencing are largely unknown. We conducted an unbiased, genome-wide siRNA screen and series of secondary screens that identified 96 cellular genes that contribute to the repression of the HPV LCR. In addition to confirming a role for the E2-binding bromodomain protein Brd4 in E2-mediated silencing, we identified a number of genes that have not previously been implicated in E2 repression, including the demethylase JARID1C/SMCX as well as EP400, a component of the NuA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex. Each of these genes contributes independently and additively to E2-mediated silencing, indicating that E2 functions through several distinct cellular complexes to repress E6 and E7 expression."
22140357,Repressive LTR nucleosome positioning by the BAF complex is required for HIV latency.,"Persistence of a reservoir of latently infected memory T cells provides a barrier to HIV eradication in treated patients. Several reports have implicated the involvement of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes in restricting early steps in HIV infection, in coupling the processes of integration and remodeling, and in promoter/LTR transcription activation and repression. However, the mechanism behind the seemingly contradictory involvement of SWI/SNF in the HIV life cycle remains unclear. Here we addressed the role of SWI/SNF in regulation of the latent HIV LTR before and after transcriptional activation. We determined the predicted nucleosome affinity of the LTR sequence and found a striking reverse correlation when compared to the strictly positioned in vivo LTR nucleosomal structure; sequences encompassing the DNase hypersensitive regions displayed the highest nucleosome affinity, while the strictly positioned nucleosomes displayed lower affinity for nucleosome formation. To examine the mechanism behind this reverse correlation, we used a combinatorial approach to determine DNA accessibility, histone occupancy, and the unique recruitment and requirement of BAF and PBAF, two functionally distinct subclasses of SWI/SNF at the LTR of HIV-infected cells before and after activation. We find that establishment and maintenance of HIV latency requires BAF, which removes a preferred nucleosome from DHS1 to position the repressive nucleosome-1 over energetically sub-optimal sequences. Depletion of BAF resulted in de-repression of HIV latency concomitant with a dramatic alteration in the LTR nucleosome profile as determined by high resolution MNase nucleosomal mapping. Upon activation, BAF was lost from the HIV promoter, while PBAF was selectively recruited by acetylated Tat to facilitate LTR transcription. Thus BAF and PBAF, recruited during different stages of the HIV life cycle, display opposing function on the HIV promoter. Our data point to the ATP-dependent BRG1 component of BAF as a putative therapeutic target to deplete the latent reservoir in patients."
23001144,Inhibition of TLR signaling by a bacterial protein containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs.,"The protein Tir (translocated intimin receptor) in enteric bacteria shares sequence similarity with the host cellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs). Despite the importance of Tir in pedestal formation, relatively little is known about the role of Tir and its ITIMs in the regulation of the host immune response. Here we demonstrate that Tir from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) interacted with the host cellular tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in an ITIM phosphorylation-dependent manner. The association of Tir with SHP-1 facilitated the recruitment of SHP-1 to the adaptor TRAF6 and inhibited the ubiquitination of TRAF6. Moreover, the ITIMs of Tir suppressed EPEC-stimulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibited intestinal immunity to infection with Citrobacter rodentium. Our findings identify a previously unknown mechanism by which bacterial ITIM-containing proteins can inhibit innate immune responses."
17259306,Hepatitis B virus X protein enhances androgen receptor-responsive gene expression depending on androgen level.,"Persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One intriguing feature of HBV-related HCC is the male predominance, with a male to female ratio of 5-7:1. This dominance has been attributed to the elevated androgen level and the enhanced androgen receptor (AR)-mediated activity in the host. How HBV infection and AR signaling modulate HCC is unknown. We investigated whether the HBV nonstructural protein, X protein (HBx) could cooperate with the AR signaling pathway to enhance carcinogenesis. We found that HBx increased the anchorage-independent colony-formation potency of AR in a nontransformed mouse hepatocyte cell line. We also found that HBx functioned as a positive transcriptional coregulator to increase AR-mediated transcriptional activity. This transcription enhancement was increased in the presence of androgen in a concentration-responsive manner, thus explaining a more prominent effect in males. HBx did not physically associate with ligand-bound AR in the nucleus, and it likely augmented AR activity by increasing the phosphorylation of AR through HBx-mediated activation of the c-Src kinase signaling pathway. Our study documents HBx as a previously undescribed class of noncellular positive coregulators for AR. The results reveal a mechanism for the vulnerability of males to microbial infections and the subsequent development of cancer."
24418540,Defining HIV-1 Vif residues that interact with CBFβ by site-directed mutagenesis.,"Vif is essential for HIV-1 replication in T cells and macrophages. Vif recruits a host ubiquitin ligase complex to promote proteasomal degradation of the APOBEC3 restriction factors by poly-ubiquitination. The cellular transcription cofactor CBFβ is required for Vif function by stabilizing the Vif protein and promoting recruitment of a cellular Cullin5-RING ubiquitin ligase complex. Interaction between Vif and CBFβ is a promising therapeutic target, but little is known about the interfacial residues. We now demonstrate that Vif conserved residues E88/W89 are crucial for CBFβ binding. Substitution of E88/W89 to alanines impaired binding to CBFβ, degradation of APOBEC3, and virus infectivity in the presence of APOBEC3 in single-cycle infection. In spreading infection, NL4-3 with Vif E88A/W89A mutation replicated comparably to wild-type virus in permissive CEM-SS cells, but not in multiple APOBEC3 expressing non-permissive CEM cells. These results support a model in which HIV-1 Vif residues E88/W89 may participate in binding CBFβ."
22921828,Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli exploits a tryptophan switch to hijack host f-actin assembly.,"Intrinsically disordered protein (IDP)-mediated interactions are often characterized by low affinity but high specificity. These traits are essential in signaling and regulation that require reversibility. Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) exploit this situation by commandeering host cytoskeletal signaling to stimulate actin assembly beneath bound bacteria, generating ""pedestals"" that promote intestinal colonization. EHEC translocates two proteins, EspF(U) and Tir, which form a complex with the host protein IRTKS. The interaction of this complex with N-WASP triggers localized actin polymerization. We show that EspF(U) is an IDP that contains a transiently α-helical N-terminus and dynamic C-terminus. Our structure shows that single EspF(U) repeat forms a high-affinity trimolecular complex with N-WASP and IRTKS. We demonstrate that bacterial and cellular ligands interact with IRTKS SH3 in a similar fashion, but the bacterial protein has evolved to outcompete cellular targets by utilizing a tryptophan switch that offers superior binding affinity enabling EHEC-induced pedestal formation."
23393263,Structural basis for hijacking of cellular LxxLL motifs by papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins.,"E6 viral oncoproteins are key players in epithelial tumors induced by papillomaviruses in vertebrates, including cervical cancer in humans. E6 proteins target many host proteins by specifically interacting with acidic LxxLL motifs. We solved the crystal structures of bovine (BPV1) and human (HPV16) papillomavirus E6 proteins bound to LxxLL peptides from the focal adhesion protein paxillin and the ubiquitin ligase E6AP, respectively. In both E6 proteins, two zinc domains and a linker helix form a basic-hydrophobic pocket, which captures helical LxxLL motifs in a way compatible with other interaction modes. Mutational inactivation of the LxxLL binding pocket disrupts the oncogenic activities of both E6 proteins. This work reveals the structural basis of both the multifunctionality and the oncogenicity of E6 proteins."
26789255,Structure of the E6/E6AP/p53 complex required for HPV-mediated degradation of p53.,"The p53 pro-apoptotic tumour suppressor is mutated or functionally altered in most cancers. In epithelial tumours induced by 'high-risk' mucosal human papilloma viruses, including human cervical carcinoma and a growing number of head-and-neck cancers, p53 is degraded by the viral oncoprotein E6 (ref. 2). In this process, E6 binds to a short leucine (L)-rich LxxLL consensus sequence within the cellular ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Subsequently, the E6/E6AP heterodimer recruits and degrades p53 (ref. 4). Neither E6 nor E6AP are separately able to recruit p53 (refs 3, 5), and the precise mode of assembly of E6, E6AP and p53 is unknown. Here we solve the crystal structure of a ternary complex comprising full-length human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) E6, the LxxLL motif of E6AP and the core domain of p53. The LxxLL motif of E6AP renders the conformation of E6 competent for interaction with p53 by structuring a p53-binding cleft on E6. Mutagenesis of critical positions at the E6-p53 interface disrupts p53 degradation. The E6-binding site of p53 is distal from previously described DNA- and protein-binding surfaces of the core domain. This suggests that, in principle, E6 may avoid competition with cellular factors by targeting both free and bound p53 molecules. The E6/E6AP/p53 complex represents a prototype of viral hijacking of both the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway and the p53 tumour suppressor pathway. The present structure provides a framework for the design of inhibitory therapeutic strategies against oncogenesis mediated by human papilloma virus."
17055432,Insulin degrading enzyme is a cellular receptor mediating varicella-zoster virus infection and cell-to-cell spread.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. While varicella is likely spread as cell-free virus to susceptible hosts, the virus is transmitted by cell-to-cell spread in the body and in vitro. Since VZV glycoprotein E (gE) is essential for virus infection, we postulated that gE binds to a cellular receptor. We found that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) interacts with gE through its extracellular domain. Downregulation of IDE by siRNA, or blocking of IDE with antibody, with soluble IDE protein extracted from liver, or with bacitracin inhibited VZV infection. Cell-to-cell spread of virus was also impaired by blocking IDE. Transfection of cell lines impaired for VZV infection with a plasmid expressing human IDE resulted in increased entry and enhanced infection with cell-free and cell-associated virus. These studies indicate that IDE is a cellular receptor for both cell-free and cell-associated VZV."
16177824,Mediation of Epstein-Barr virus EBNA-LP transcriptional coactivation by Sp100.,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA-LP protein is important for EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization and is a potent gene-specific coactivator of the viral transcriptional activator, EBNA2. The mechanism(s) by which EBNA-LP functions as a coactivator remains an important question in the biology of EBV-induced B-cell immortalization. In this study, we found that EBNA-LP interacts with the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML NB)-associated protein Sp100 and displaces Sp100 and heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha) from PML NBs. Interaction between EBNA-LP and Sp100 was mediated through conserved region 3 in EBNA-LP and the PML NB targeting domain in Sp100. Overexpression of Sp100 lacking the N-terminal PML NB targeting domain, but not a mutant form of Sp100 lacking the HP1alpha interaction domain, was sufficient to coactivate EBNA2 in a gene-specific manner independent of EBNA-LP. These findings suggest that Sp100 is a major mediator of EBNA-LP coactivation. These studies indicate that modulation of PML NB-associated proteins may be important for establishment of latent viral infections, and also identify a convenient model system to investigate the functions of Sp100."
26347747,HIV-1 Structural Proteins Serve as PAMPs for TLR2 Heterodimers Significantly Increasing Infection and Innate Immune Activation.,"Immune activation is critical to HIV infection and pathogenesis; however, our understanding of HIV innate immune activation remains incomplete. Recently we demonstrated that soluble TLR2 (sTLR2) physically inhibited HIV-induced NFκB activation and inflammation, as well as HIV-1 infection. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that HIV-1 structural proteins may serve as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) for cellular TLR2 heterodimers. These studies made use of primary human T cells and TZMbl cells stably transformed to express TLR2 (TZMbl-2). Our results demonstrated that cells expressing TLR2 showed significantly increased proviral DNA compared to cells lacking TLR2, and mechanistically this may be due to a TLR2-mediated increased CCR5 expression. Importantly, we show that HIV-1 structural proteins, p17, p24, and gp41, act as viral PAMPs signaling through TLR2 and its heterodimers leading to significantly increased immune activation via the NFκB signaling pathway. Using co-immunoprecipitation and a dot blot method, we demonstrated direct protein interactions between these viral PAMPs and TLR2, while only p17 and gp41 bound to TLR1. Specifically, TLR2/1 heterodimer recognized p17 and gp41, while p24 lead to immune activation through TLR2/6. These results were confirmed using TLR2/1 siRNA knock down assays which ablated p17 and gp41-induced cellular activation and through studies of HEK293 cells expressing selected TLRs. Interestingly, our results show in the absence of TLR6, p24 bound to TLR2 and blocked p17 and gp41-induced activation, thus providing a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 can manipulate innate sensing. Taken together, our results identified, for the first time, novel HIV-1 PAMPs that play a role in TLR2-mediated cellular activation and increased proviral DNA. These findings have important implications for our fundamental understanding of HIV-1 immune activation and pathogenesis, as well as HIV-1 vaccine development."
21098279,Recognition of tandem PxxP motifs as a unique Src homology 3-binding mode triggers pathogen-driven actin assembly.,"Src homology 3 (SH3) domains are globular protein interaction modules that regulate cell behavior. The classic SH3 ligand-binding site accommodates a hydrophobic PxxP motif and a positively charged specificity-determining residue. We have determined the NMR structure of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS) SH3 domain in complex with a repeat from Escherichia coli-secreted protein F-like protein encoded on prophage U (EspF(U)), a translocated effector of enterohemorrhagic E. coli that commandeers the mammalian actin assembly machinery. EspF(U)-IRTKS interaction is among the highest affinity natural SH3 ligands. Our complex structure reveals a unique type of SH3 interaction based on recognition of tandem PxxP motifs in the ligand. Strikingly, the specificity pocket of IRTKS SH3 has evolved to accommodate a polyproline type II helical peptide analogously to docking of the canonical PxxP by the conserved IRTKS SH3 proline-binding pockets. This cooperative binding explains the high-affinity SH3 interaction and is required for EspF(U)-IRTKS interaction in mammalian cells as well as the formation of localized actin ""pedestals"" beneath bound bacteria. Importantly, tandem PxxP motifs are also found in mammalian ligands and have been shown to contribute to IRTKS SH3 recognition similarly."
25599645,Molecular determinants for nuclear import of influenza A PB2 by importin α isoforms 3 and 7.,"Influenza A virus polymerase subunit PB2 is a major virulence determinant implicated in pathogenicity and host adaptation. During cross-species virus transfer from avian to mammalian cells, PB2 switches specificity from importin α3 to α7. This specificity is not recapitulated in vitro, where PB2 binds all importin α isoforms with comparably high affinity. In this study, we investigated the structure, conformational dynamics, and autoinhibition of importin α isoforms 1, 3, and 7 in complex with PB2. Our data suggest that association of PB2 with α3 and α7 is favored by reduced autoinhibition of these isoforms and by the unique structure of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain of PB2. We propose that by recruiting importin α3 or α7 in the absence of importin β, PB2 reduces the complexity of adaptor-mediated import to a pseudo-bimolecular reaction, thereby acquiring a kinetic advantage over classical NLS cargos, which form an import complex only when importin α and β are simultaneously available."
25901786,ASK1 restores the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G by disrupting HIV-1 Vif-mediated counteraction.,"APOBEC3G (A3G) is an innate antiviral restriction factor that strongly inhibits the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). An HIV-1 accessory protein, Vif, hijacks the host ubiquitin-proteasome system to execute A3G degradation. Identification of the host pathways that obstruct the action of Vif could provide a new strategy for blocking viral replication. We demonstrate here that the host protein ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) interferes with the counteraction by Vif and revitalizes A3G-mediated viral restriction. ASK1 binds the BC-box of Vif, thereby disrupting the assembly of the Vif-ubiquitin ligase complex. Consequently, ASK1 stabilizes A3G and promotes its incorporation into viral particles, ultimately reducing viral infectivity. Furthermore, treatment with the antiretroviral drug AZT (zidovudine) induces ASK1 expression and restores the antiviral activity of A3G in HIV-1-infected cells. This study thus demonstrates a distinct function of ASK1 in restoring the host antiviral system that can be enhanced by AZT treatment."
25633977,Angiomotin functions in HIV-1 assembly and budding.,"Many retroviral Gag proteins contain PPXY late assembly domain motifs that recruit proteins of the NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase family to facilitate virus release. Overexpression of NEDD4L can also stimulate HIV-1 release but in this case the Gag protein lacks a PPXY motif, suggesting that NEDD4L may function through an adaptor protein. Here, we demonstrate that the cellular protein Angiomotin (AMOT) can bind both NEDD4L and HIV-1 Gag. HIV-1 release and infectivity are stimulated by AMOT overexpression and inhibited by AMOT depletion, whereas AMOT mutants that cannot bind NEDD4L cannot function in virus release. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that in the absence of AMOT assembling Gag molecules fail to form a fully spherical enveloped particle. Our experiments indicate that AMOT and other motin family members function together with NEDD4L to help complete immature virion assembly prior to ESCRT-mediated virus budding."
24735396,Comparative thermodynamic analysis of zinc binding to the His/Cys motif in virion infectivity factor.,"HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif) is an accessory protein that induces the proteasomal degradation of the host restriction factor, apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G). Degradation of APOBEC3G requires the interaction of Vif with Cul5, the scaffold for an E3 ubiquitin ligase. A highly conserved region in HIV-1 Vif termed the HCCH motif binds zinc and is critical for recruitment of Cul5 and degradation of APOBEC3G. To gain thermodynamic and mechanistic insight into zinc binding to diverse Vif proteins, we have employed a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry, analytical ultracentrifugation, and Cul5 pull down assays. The proton linkage of zinc binding to HIV-1 Vif was analyzed under different buffer conditions and consistent with the release of two Cys-thiol protons upon zinc binding, supporting earlier EXAFS studies. Zinc binding to Vif proteins from HIV-1, SIVAgm, HIV-2, and SIVMac followed a trend in which the enthalpy of zinc binding became less favorable and the entropy of zinc binding became more favorable. Using AUC, we determined that zinc induced oligomerization of Vif proteins from HIV-1 and SIVAgm but had little or no effect on the oligomeric properties of Vif proteins from HIV-2 and SIVMac. The zinc dependence of Cul5 recruitment by Vif was investigated. All Vif proteins except HIV-2 Vif required zinc to stabilize the interaction with Cul5. The trends in enthalpy-entropy compensation, zinc-induced oligomerization, and Cul5 recruitment are discussed in terms of the apo conformation of the HCCH motif and the role of zinc in stabilizing the structure of Vif."
22483108,Solution structure analysis of the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein reveals a self-association mechanism required for E6-mediated degradation of p53.,"The viral oncoprotein E6 is an essential factor for cervical cancers induced by ""high-risk"" mucosal HPV. Among other oncogenic activities, E6 recruits the ubiquitin ligase E6AP to promote the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of p53. E6 is prone to self-association, which long precluded its structural analysis. Here we found that E6 specifically dimerizes through its N-terminal domain and that disruption of the dimer interface strongly increases E6 solubility. This allowed us to raise structural data covering the entire HPV16 E6 protein, including the high-resolution NMR structures of the two zinc-binding domains of E6 and a robust data-driven model structure of the N-terminal domain homodimer. Interestingly, homodimer interface mutations that disrupt E6 self-association also inactivate E6-mediated p53 degradation. These data suggest that E6 needs to self-associate via its N-terminal domain to promote the polyubiquitination of p53 by E6AP."
16455799,Anthrax lethal factor and edema factor act on conserved targets in Drosophila.,"Many bacterial toxins act on conserved components of essential host-signaling pathways. One consequence of this conservation is that genetic model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster can be used for analyzing the mechanism of toxin action. In this study, we characterize the activities of two anthrax virulence factors, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor, in transgenic Drosophila. LF is a zinc metalloprotease that cleaves and inactivates most human mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases (MAPKKs). We found that LF similarly cleaves the Drosophila MAPK kinases Hemipterous (Hep) and Licorne in vitro. Consistent with these observations, expression of LF in Drosophila inhibited the Hep/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway during embryonic dorsal closure and the related process of adult thoracic closure. Epistasis experiments confirmed that LF acts at the level of Hep. We also found that LF inhibits Ras/MAPK signaling during wing development and that LF acts upstream of MAPK and downstream of Raf, consistent with LF acting at the level of Dsor. In addition, we found that edema factor, a potent adenylate cyclase, inhibits the hh pathway during wing development, consistent with the known role of cAMP-dependent PKA in suppressing the Hedgehog response. These results demonstrate that anthrax toxins function in Drosophila as they do in mammalian cells and open the way to using Drosophila as a multicellular host system for studying the in vivo function of diverse toxins and virulence factors."
16595549,Evidence for a role of transmembrane protein p25 in localization of protein tyrosine phosphatase TC48 to the ER.,"T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase gives rise to two splice isoforms: TC48, which is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and TC45, a nuclear protein. The present study was undertaken to identify proteins that are involved in targeting TC48 to the ER. We identified two TC48-interacting proteins, p25 and p23, from a yeast two-hybrid screen. p23 and p25 are members of a family of putative cargo receptors that are important for vesicular trafficking between Golgi complex and ER. Both p23 and p25 associate with overexpressed TC48 in Cos-1 cells as determined by coimmunoprecipitation. A significant amount of TC48 colocalized initially with ERGIC and Golgi complex markers (in addition to ER and nuclear membrane localization) and was then retrieved to the ER. Coexpression with p25 enhanced ER localization of TC48, whereas coexpression with p23 resulted in its trapping in membranous structures. Coexpression of a p25 mutant lacking the ER-localization signal KKxx resulted in enhanced Golgi localization of TC48. Forty C-terminal amino acid residues of TC48 (position 376-415) were sufficient for interaction with p23 (but not with p25) and targeted green fluorescence protein (GFP) to the Golgi complex. Targeting of GFP to the ER required 66 C-terminal amino acid residues of TC48 (position 350-415), which showed interaction with p25 and p23. We suggest that TC48 translocates to the Golgi complex along the secretory pathway, whereas its ER localization is maintained by selective retrieval enabled by interactions with p25 and p23."
11119609,Interaction of the influenza virus nucleoprotein with the cellular CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway.,"Influenza virus transcription occurs in the nuclei of infected cells, where the viral genomic RNAs are complexed with a nucleoprotein (NP) to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) structures. Prior to assembly into progeny virions, these RNPs exit the nucleus and accumulate in the cytoplasm. The mechanisms responsible for RNP export are only partially understood but have been proposed to involve the viral M1 and NS2 polypeptides. We found that the drug leptomycin B (LMB), which specifically inactivates the cellular CRM1 polypeptide, caused nuclear retention of NP in virus-infected cells, indicating a role for the CRM1 nuclear export pathway in RNP egress. However, no alteration was seen in the cellular distribution of M1 or NS2, even in the case of a mutant virus which synthesizes greatly reduced amounts of NS2. Furthermore, NP was distributed throughout the nuclei of infected cells at early times postinfection but, when retained in the nucleus at late times by LMB treatment, was redistributed to the periphery of the nucleoplasm. No such change was seen in the nuclear distribution of M1 or NS2 after drug treatment. Similar to the behavior of NP, M1 and NS2 in infected cells, LMB treatment of cells expressing each polypeptide in isolation caused nuclear retention of NP but not M1 or NS2. Conversely, overexpression of CRM1 caused increased cytoplasmic accumulation of NP but had little effect on M1 or NS2 distribution. Consistent with this, NP bound CRM1 in vitro. Overall, these data raise the possibility that RNP export is mediated by a direct interaction between NP and the cellular CRM1 export pathway."
9557649,Hepatitis delta antigen mediates the nuclear import of hepatitis delta virus RNA.,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA replicates in the nuclei of virus-infected cells. The mechanism of nuclear import of HDV RNA is so far unknown. Using a fluorescein-labeled HDV RNA introduced into partially permeabilized HeLa cells, we found that HDV RNA accumulated only in the cytoplasm. However, in the presence of hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), which is the only protein encoded by HDV RNA, the HDV RNA was translocated into the nucleus, suggesting that nuclear import of HDV RNA is mediated by HDAg. Deletion of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) or RNA-binding motifs of HDAg resulted in the failure of nuclear import of HDV RNA, indicating that both the NLS and an RNA-binding motif of HDAg are required for the RNA-transporting activity of HDAg. Surprisingly, any one of the three previously identified RNA-binding motifs was sufficient to confer the RNA-transporting activity. We have further shown that HDAg, via its NLS, interacts with karyopherin alpha2 in vitro, suggesting that nuclear import of the HDAg-HDV RNA complex is mediated by the karyopherin alpha2beta heterodimer. The nuclear import of HDV RNA may be the first biological function of HDAg in the HDV life cycle."
9971805,Modulation of nuclear localization of the influenza virus nucleoprotein through interaction with actin filaments.,"The influenza virus genome is transcribed in the nuclei of infected cells but assembled into progeny virions in the cytoplasm. This is reflected in the cellular distribution of the virus nucleoprotein (NP), a protein which encapsidates genomic RNA to form ribonucleoprotein structures. At early times postinfection NP is found in the nucleus, but at later times it is found predominantly in the cytoplasm. NP contains several sequences proposed to act as nuclear localization signals (NLSs), and it is not clear how these are overridden to allow cytoplasmic accumulation of the protein. We find that NP binds tightly to filamentous actin in vitro and have identified a cluster of residues in NP essential for the interaction. Complexes containing RNA, NP, and actin could be formed, suggesting that viral ribonucleoproteins also bind actin. In cells, exogenously expressed NP when expressed at a high level partitioned to the cytoplasm, where it associated with F-actin stress fibers. In contrast, mutants unable to bind F-actin efficiently were imported into the nucleus even under conditions of high-level expression. Similarly, nuclear import of NLS-deficient NP molecules was restored by concomitant disruption of F-actin binding. We propose that the interaction of NP with F-actin causes the cytoplasmic retention of influenza virus ribonucleoproteins."
12542496,HIV-1 matrix protein p17 enhances the proliferative activity of natural killer cells and increases their ability to secrete proinflammatory cytokines.,"We investigated the effects of human immunodeficiency type-1 virus (HIV-1) matrix protein p17 on freshly isolated and purified human natural killer (NK) cells. HIV-1 p17 increased the cytokines interleukin (IL) 2, IL-12 and IL-15, and induced natural killer cell proliferation, but not cytotoxicity. This effect was specific because it was abrogated by anti-p17 monoclonal antibody. Moreover, HIV-1 p17 enhanced the cytokine-induced production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma by NK cells. IL-4 downregulated IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secretion in IL-2- and IL-15-treated NK cells. HIV-1 p17 restored the ability of NK cells to produce both cytokines when added to the cultures simultaneously with IL-4. The property of p17 to increase the production of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma might be a mechanism used by HIV-1 to modulate the immune system to support its replication and spreading."
11278695,The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein inhibits NF-kappa B activation by interfering with beta TrCP-mediated degradation of Ikappa B.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu protein binds to the CD4 receptor and induces its degradation by cytosolic proteasomes. This process involves the recruitment of human betaTrCP (TrCP), a key member of the SkpI-Cdc53-F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that specifically interacts with phosphorylated Vpu molecules. Interestingly, Vpu itself, unlike other TrCP-interacting proteins, is not targeted for degradation by proteasomes. We now report that, by virtue of its affinity for TrCP and resistance to degradation, Vpu, but not a phosphorylation mutant unable to interact with TrCP, has a dominant negative effect on TrCP function. As a consequence, expression of Vpu in HIV-infected T cells or in HeLa cells inhibited TNF-alpha-induced degradation of IkappaB-alpha. Vpu did not inhibit TNF-alpha-mediated activation of the IkappaB kinase but instead interfered with the subsequent TrCP-dependent degradation of phosphorylated IkappaB-alpha. This resulted in a pronounced reduction of NF-kappaB activity. We also observed that in cells producing Vpu-defective virus, NF-kappaB activity was significantly increased even in the absence of cytokine stimulation. However, in the presence of Vpu, this HIV-mediated NF-kappaB activation was markedly reduced. These results suggest that Vpu modulates both virus- and cytokine-induced activation of NF-kappaB in HIV-1-infected cells."
10359081,The HIV-1 Vpr co-activator induces a conformational change in TFIIB.,"Vpr is a HIV-1 virion-associated protein which plays a role in viral replication and in transcription and cell proliferation. We have previously reported that Vpr stimulates transcription of genes lacking a common DNA target sequence likely through its ability to interact with TFIIB. However, the molecular mechanism of the Vpr-mediated transcription remains to be precisely defined. In this in vitro study, we show that the binding site of Vpr in TFIIB overlaps the domain of TFIIB which is engaged in the intramolecular bridge between the N- and C-terminus of TFIIB, highly suggesting that binding of Vpr may induce a change in the conformation of TFIIB. Indeed, with a partial proteolysis assay using V8 protease, we demonstrate that Vpr has the ability to change the conformation of TFIIB. We investigated in this partial proteolysis assay a series of Vpr-mutated proteins previously defined for their transactivation properties. Our data show a correlation between the ability of Vpr-mutated proteins to stimulate transcription and their ability to induce a conformational change in TFIIB, indicating a functional relevance of the Vpr-TFIIB interaction."
8800208,The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr transactivator: cooperation with promoter-bound activator domains and binding to TFIIB.,"Since the first report documenting that HIV-1 Vpr was involved in the stimulation of transactivation of several unrelated promoters, little additional information has been reported. By using transient transfection experiments, we confirmed and extended these previously reported data. Further in vivo experiments showed that Vpr can co-operatively stimulate transactivation activity of a minimal promoter containing one GAL4 DNA-binding site, when it is co-expressed with different heterologous activator domains fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Thus, Vpr could transactivate in concert with an activator domain, but has no effect on the transactivation of a minimal promoter in the absence of activator protein. To investigate whether Vpr can interact with components of the basal transcriptional machinery, in vitro protein-protein binding assays were performed using either translated, radiolabeled Vpr or TFIIB proteins and glutathione S-transferase Vpr or TFIIB chimeric proteins. We demonstrated that the portion of Vpr ranging from amino acids 15 to 77 interacts specifically with the basal transcription factor TFIIB. Also, our data indicated that the N-terminal domain of TFIIB is required for the interaction."
1905983,The HIV core protein p24 inhibits interferon-gamma-induced increase of HLA-DR and cytochrome b heavy chain mRNA levels in the human monocyte-like cell line THP1.,"Cells from the human monocytic cell-line THP1 were incubated prior to activation with IFN-gamma or LPS with varying amounts of p24, the main product of the HIV gag gene and the major component of the virus core. The IFN-gamma-dependent increase of mRNA for HLA-DR and for the heavy chain of cytochrome b was markedly decreased by p24 but not by gp120. This effect was abrogated by anti-p24 antibodies. On the other hand, preincubation of THP1 cells with p24 did not affect the accumulation of the LPS-dependent mRNA for TNF alpha and IL1-beta. These results indicate that p24 at concentrations similar to those found in the serum of HIV-infected individuals specifically affects IFN-gamma-induced activation markers."
1433512,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein induces rapid degradation of CD4.,"CD4 is an integral membrane glycoprotein which is known as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receptor for infection of human cells. The protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequently transported to the cell surface via the Golgi complex. HIV infection of CD4+ cells leads to downmodulation of cell surface CD4, due at least in part to the formation of stable intracellular complexes between CD4 and the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) Env precursor polyprotein gp160. This process ""traps"" both proteins in the ER, leading to reduced surface expression of CD4 and reduced processing of gp160 to gp120 and gp41. We have recently demonstrated that the presence of the HIV-1-encoded integral membrane protein Vpu can reduce the formation of Env-CD4 complexes, resulting in increased gp160 processing and decreased CD4 stability. We have studied the effect of Vpu on CD4 stability and found that Vpu induces rapid degradation of CD4, reducing the half-life of CD4 from 6 h to 12 min. By using a CD4-binding mutant of gp160, we were able to show that this Vpu-induced degradation of CD4 requires retention of CD4 in the ER, which is normally accomplished through its binding to gp160. The involvement of gp160 in the induction of CD4 degradation is restricted to its function as a CD4 trap, since, in the absence of Env, an ER retention mutant of CD4, as well as wild-type CD4 in cultures treated with brefeldin A, a drug that blocks transport of proteins from the ER, is degraded in the presence of Vpu."
8139011,Differential activities of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1-encoded Vpu protein are regulated by phosphorylation and occur in different cellular compartments.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific Vpu is an 81-amino-acid amphipathic integral membrane protein with at least two different biological functions: (i) enhancement of virus particle release from the plasma membrane of HIV-1-infected cells and (ii) degradation of the virus receptor CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have previously found that Vpu is phosphorylated in infected cells at two seryl residues in positions 52 and 56 by the ubiquitous casein kinase 2. To study the role of Vpu phosphorylation on its biological activity, a mutant of the vpu gene lacking both phosphoacceptor sites was introduced into the infectious molecular clone of HIV-1, pNL4-3, as well as subgenomic Vpu expression vectors. This mutation did not affect the expression level or the stability of Vpu but had a significant effect on its biological activity in infected T cells as well as transfected HeLa cells. Despite the presence of comparable amounts of wild-type and nonphosphorylated Vpu, decay of CD4 was observed only in the presence of phosphorylated wild-type Vpu. Nonphosphorylated Vpu was unable to induce degradation of CD4 even if the proteins were artificially retained in the ER. In contrast, Vpu-mediated enhancement of virus secretion was only partially dependent on Vpu phosphorylation. Enhancement of particle release by wild-type Vpu was efficiently blocked when Vpu was artificially retained in the ER, suggesting that the two biological functions of Vpu are independent, occur at different sites within a cell, and exhibit different sensitivity to phosphorylation."
9499087,CD4 glycoprotein degradation induced by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein requires the function of proteasomes and the ubiquitin-conjugating pathway.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vpu gene encodes a type I anchored integral membrane phosphoprotein with two independent functions. First, it regulates virus release from a post-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment by an ion channel activity mediated by its transmembrane anchor. Second, it induces the selective down regulation of host cell receptor proteins (CD4 and major histocompatibility complex class I molecules) in a process involving its phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail. In the present work, we show that the Vpu-induced proteolysis of nascent CD4 can be completely blocked by peptide aldehydes that act as competitive inhibitors of proteasome function and also by lactacystin, which blocks proteasome activity by covalently binding to the catalytic beta subunits of proteasomes. The sensitivity of Vpu-induced CD4 degradation to proteasome inhibitors paralleled the inhibition of proteasome degradation of a model ubiquitinated substrate. Characterization of CD4-associated oligosaccharides indicated that CD4 rescued from Vpu-induced degradation by proteasome inhibitors is exported from the ER to the Golgi complex. This finding suggests that retranslocation of CD4 from the ER to the cytosol may be coupled to its proteasomal degradation. CD4 degradation mediated by Vpu does not require the ER chaperone calnexin and is dependent on an intact ubiquitin-conjugating system. This was demonstrated by inhibition of CD4 degradation (i) in cells expressing a thermally inactivated form of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 or (ii) following expression of a mutant form of ubiquitin (Lys48 mutated to Arg48) known to compromise ubiquitin targeting by interfering with the formation of polyubiquitin complexes. CD4 degradation was also prevented by altering the four Lys residues in its cytosolic domain to Arg, suggesting a role for ubiquitination of one or more of these residues in the process of degradation. The results clearly demonstrate a role for the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the process of Vpu-induced CD4 degradation. In contrast to other viral proteins (human cytomegalovirus US2 and US11), however, whose translocation of host ER molecules into the cytosol occurs in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, Vpu-targeted CD4 remains in the ER in a transport-competent form when proteasome activity is blocked."
1727486,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein regulates the formation of intracellular gp160-CD4 complexes.,"Intracellular transport and processing of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope precursor glycoprotein, gp160, proceeds via the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex and involves proteolytic processing of gp160 into the mature virion components, gp120 and gp41. We found that coexpression of gp160 and human CD4 in HeLa cells severely impaired gp120 production due to the formation of intracellular gp160-CD4 complexes. This CD4-mediated inhibition of gp160 processing was alleviated by coexpression of the HIV-1-encoded Vpu protein. The coexpression of Vpu and CD4 in the presence of gp160 resulted in increased degradation of CD4. Although the precise mechanism(s) responsible for the Vpu effect is presently unclear, our findings suggest that Vpu may destabilize intracellular gp160-CD4 complexes."
9292011,Biochemical and functional interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat transactivator with the general transcription factor TFIIB.,"Tat strongly stimulates transcription of the human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) provirus by interacting with various cellular transcription factors, including TFIID. The results presented in this report indicate that the effect exerted by Tat also involves an interaction with TFIIB. A direct protein-protein interaction between Tat and TFIIB was observed in vitro. Detailed analysis of this interaction showed that the cysteine-rich and core domains of Tat bind to the N-terminal moiety of the general transcription factor. The role of the interaction between Tat and TFIIB in the activation of the entire HIV-1 promoter was analysed. Transfection experiments performed using a reporter construct containing the HIV-1 long terminal repeat fused to a reporter gene showed that overexpression of TFIIB progressively suppressed Tat-induced transcription. This effect was weakened by an increase in the intracellular concentration of Tat. A similar consequence of TFIIB overexpression was observed in a HeLa cell line stably transformed with a construct corresponding to the lacZ gene under the control of the HIV-1 promoter. Mutants of TFIIB which differed in their ability to interact with Tat and to function in basal transcription were analysed. The ability of TFIIB mutants defective for basal transcription to inhibit Tat-induced activity of the HIV-1 promoter depended on their capacity to interact with Tat. Mutants of TFIIB functional for basal transcription, but defective for the interaction with Tat, exhibited a dominant negative effect. From these data we propose a model in which interaction between Tat and both general transcription factors TBP and TFIIB maintains the transcriptional initiation complex in an active configuration."
10644726,The nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor interacts with HIV-1 Tat and stimulates viral replication in human microglial cells.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects the central nervous system and plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV-1 expression in the central nervous system are poorly understood. We have recently reported that the nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is an activator of HIV-1 gene transcription. Here, our results show that COUP-TF stimulates HIV-1 transcription in primary cultured human microglial cells, the primary target for HIV-1 infection in brain. Run-on assays indicated that COUP-TF acts on the initiation step of transcription. Results from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry analysis further revealed the importance of this factor by demonstrating that overexpression of COUP-TF leads to initiation of viral replication in primary HIV-infected human microglia. In addition, COUP-TF is able to physically interact and cooperate with the viral transactivator Tat. The combination of COUP-TF and Tat leads to NF-kappaB- and Sp1-independent enhanced transcriptional stimulation. In vitro binding studies showed that COUP-TF interacts with Tat through amino acids within the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of COUP-TF. Amino acids 48-72 in the basic and C-terminal regions of Tat are required for the binding of Tat to COUP-TF. These results suggest that COUP-TF is an essential transcription factor involved in HIV-1 expression in microglia and reveal a novel interplay of Tat and COUP-TF during regulation of viral expression."
14561767,HIV-1 Vpu sequesters beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (betaTrCP) in the cytoplasm and provokes the accumulation of beta-catenin and other SCFbetaTrCP substrates.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein acts as an adaptor for the proteasomal degradation of CD4 by recruiting CD4 and beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (betaTrCP), the receptor component of the multisubunit SCF-betaTrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. We showed that the expression of a Vpu-green fluorescent fusion protein prevented the proteosomal degradation of betaTrCP substrates such as beta-catenin, IkappaBalpha, and ATF4, which are normally directly targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Beta-catenin was translocated into the nucleus, whereas the tumor necrosis factor-induced nuclear translocation of NFkappaB was impaired. Beta-catenin was also up-regulated in cells producing Vpu+ human immunodeficiency virus type 1 but not in cells producing Vpu-deficient viruses. The overexpression of ATF4 also provoked accumulation of beta-catenin, but to a lower level than that resulting from the expression of Vpu. Finally, the expression of Vpu induces the exclusion of betaTrCP from the nucleus. These data suggest that Vpu is a strong competitive inhibitor of betaTrCP that impairs the degradation of SCFbetaTrCP substrates as long as Vpu has an intact phosphorylation motif and can bind to betaTrCP."
27764233,ESCRT-I Protein Tsg101 Plays a Role in the Post-macropinocytic Trafficking and Infection of Endothelial Cells by Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) binding to the endothelial cell surface heparan sulfate is followed by sequential interactions with α3β1, αVβ3 and αVβ5 integrins and Ephrin A2 receptor tyrosine kinase (EphA2R). These interactions activate host cell pre-existing FAK, Src, PI3-K and RhoGTPase signaling cascades, c-Cbl mediated ubiquitination of receptors, recruitment of CIB1, p130Cas and Crk adaptor molecules, and membrane bleb formation leading to lipid raft dependent macropinocytosis of KSHV into human microvascular dermal endothelial (HMVEC-d) cells. The Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins, ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and-III, play a central role in clathrin-mediated internalized ubiquitinated receptor endosomal trafficking and sorting. ESCRT proteins have also been shown to play roles in viral egress. We have recently shown that ESCRT-0 component Hrs protein associates with the plasma membrane during macropinocytosis and mediates KSHV entry via ROCK1 mediated phosphorylation of NHE1 and local membrane pH change. Here, we demonstrate that the ESCRT-I complex Tsg101 protein also participates in the macropinocytosis of KSHV and plays a role in KSHV trafficking. Knockdown of Tsg101 did not affect virus entry in HMVEC-d and human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells but significantly inhibited the KSHV genome entry into the nucleus and consequently viral gene expression in these cells. Double and triple immunofluorescence, proximity ligation immunofluorescence and co-immuoprecipitation studies revealed the association of Tsg101 with the KSHV containing macropinosomes, and increased levels of Tsg101 association/interactions with EphA2R, c-Cbl, p130Cas and Crk signal molecules, as well as with upstream and downstream ESCRT components such as Hrs (ESCRT-0), EAP45 (ESCRT-II), CHMP6 (ESCRT-III) and CHMP5 (ESCRT-III) in the KSHV infected cells. Tsg101 was also associated with early (Rab5) and late endosomal (Rab7) stages of KSHV intracellular trafficking, and CHMP5 (ESCRT-III) was also associated with Rab 5 and Rab 7. Knockdown of Tsg101 significantly inhibited the transition of virus from early to late endosomes. Collectively, our studies reveal that Tsg101 plays a role in the trafficking of macropinocytosed KSHV in the endothelial cells which is essential for the successful viral genome delivery into the nucleus, viral gene expression and infection. Thus, ESCRT molecules could serve as therapeutic targets to combat KSHV infection."
24973451,Dengue viral protease interaction with NF-κB inhibitor α/β results in endothelial cell apoptosis and hemorrhage development.,"Hemorrhagic manifestations occur frequently accompanying a wide range of dengue disease syndromes. Much work has focused on the contribution of immune factors to the pathogenesis of hemorrhage, but how dengue virus (DENV) participates in the pathogenic process has never been explored. Although there is no consensus that apoptosis is the basis of vascular permeability in human dengue infections, we showed in dengue hemorrhage mouse model that endothelial cell apoptosis is important to hemorrhage development in mice. To explore the molecular basis of the contribution of DENV to endothelial cell death, we show in this study that DENV protease interacts with cellular IκBα and IκBβ and cleaves them. By inducing IκBα and IκBβ cleavage and IκB kinase activation, DENV protease activates NF-κB, which results in endothelial cell death. Intradermal inoculation of DENV protease packaged in adenovirus-associated virus-9 induces endothelial cell death and dermal hemorrhage in mice. Although the H51 activity site is not involved in the interaction between DENV protease and IκB-α/β, the enzymatic activity is critical to the ability of DENV protease to induce IκBα and IκBβ cleavage and trigger hemorrhage development. Moreover, overexpression of IκBα or IκBβ protects endothelial cells from DENV-induced apoptosis. In this study, we show that DENV protease participates in the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhage and discover IκBα and IκBβ to be the new cellular targets that are cleaved by DENV protease."
21795333,Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) C-terminal-activating region 3 contributes to LMP1-mediated cellular migration via its interaction with Ubc9.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), the principal viral oncoprotein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is a constitutively active membrane signaling protein that regulates multiple signal transduction pathways via its C-terminal-activating region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2, and also the less-studied CTAR3. Because protein sumoylation among other posttranslational modifications may regulate many signaling pathways induced by LMP1, we investigated whether during EBV latency LMP1 regulates sumoylation processes that control cellular activation and cellular responses. By immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that LMP1 interacts with Ubc9, the single reported SUMO-conjugating enzyme. Requirements for LMP1-Ubc9 interactions include enzymatically active Ubc9: expression of inactive Ubc9 (Ubc9 C93S) inhibited the LMP1-Ubc9 interaction. LMP1 CTAR3, but not CTAR1 and CTAR2, participated in the LMP1-Ubc9 interaction, and amino acid sequences found in CTAR3, including the JAK-interacting motif, contributed to this interaction. Furthermore, LMP1 expression coincided with increased sumoylation of cellular proteins, and disruption of the Ubc9-LMP1 CTAR3 interaction almost completely abrogated LMP1-induced protein sumoylation, suggesting that this interaction promotes the sumoylation of downstream targets. Additional consequences of the disruption of the LMP1 CTAR3-Ubc9 interaction revealed effects on cellular migration, a hallmark of oncogenesis. Together, these data demonstrate that LMP1 CTAR3 does in fact function in intracellular signaling and leads to biological effects. We propose that LMP1, by interaction with Ubc9, modulates sumoylation processes, which regulate signal transduction pathways that affect phenotypic changes associated with oncogenesis."
24557838,Specific and nonhepatotoxic degradation of nuclear hepatitis B virus cccDNA.,"Current antiviral agents can control but not eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV), because HBV establishes a stable nuclear covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Interferon-α treatment can clear HBV but is limited by systemic side effects. We describe how interferon-α can induce specific degradation of the nuclear viral DNA without hepatotoxicity and propose lymphotoxin-β receptor activation as a therapeutic alternative. Interferon-α and lymphotoxin-β receptor activation up-regulated APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B cytidine deaminases, respectively, in HBV-infected cells, primary hepatocytes, and human liver needle biopsies. HBV core protein mediated the interaction with nuclear cccDNA, resulting in cytidine deamination, apurinic/apyrimidinic site formation, and finally cccDNA degradation that prevented HBV reactivation. Genomic DNA was not affected. Thus, inducing nuclear deaminases-for example, by lymphotoxin-β receptor activation-allows the development of new therapeutics that, in combination with existing antivirals, may cure hepatitis B."
25253337,Hijacking Dlg1 for oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation in human epithelial cells is a conserved mechanism of human adenovirus E4-ORF1 proteins.,"The E4-ORF1 gene of human adenoviruses encodes a 14-kDa protein that promotes viral replication as well as cellular metabolic reprogramming, survival, and transformation by constitutively activating cellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We recently reported that the E4-ORF1 protein from subgroup D human adenovirus type 9 upregulates and oncogenically activates PI3K by a novel mechanism involving separate interactions of E4-ORF1 with cellular discs large 1 (Dlg1) and PI3K to form a ternary complex that translocates to the plasma membrane (K. Kong, M. Kumar, M. Taruishi, and R. T. Javier, PLoS Pathog. 10:e1004102, 2014, doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004102). The current study was carried out to investigate whether other human adenovirus E4-ORF1 proteins share this mechanism of action. The results showed that in human MCF10A epithelial cells, stable expression of E4-ORF1 proteins encoded by representative human adenovirus serotypes from subgroups A to D induce ternary complex formation, Dlg1-dependent PI3K activation, PI3K protein elevation, Dlg1 and PI3K membrane recruitment, and PI3K-dependent cellular transformation. The first three of these E4-ORF1 activities were also observed in MCF10A cells infected with each wild-type human adenovirus from subgroups A to D. Our findings indicate that most, if not all, human adenovirus E4-ORF1 proteins share a conserved molecular mechanism of PI3K activation, which confers a common capacity to promote oncogenic transformation in human epithelial cells."
20404187,Divergent susceptibilities of human herpesvirus 6 variants to type I interferons.,"Two distinct human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) variants infect humans. HHV-6B is the etiologic agent of roseola and is associated with life-threatening neurological diseases, such as encephalitis, as well as organ transplant failure. The epidemiology and disease association for HHV-6A remain ill-defined. Specific anti-HHV-6 drugs do not exist and classic antiherpes drugs have secondary effects that are often problematic for transplant patients. Clinical trials using IFN were also performed with inconclusive results. We investigated the efficacy of type I IFN (alpha/beta) in controlling HHV-6 infection. We report that cells infected with laboratory strains and primary isolates of HHV-6B are resistant to IFN-alpha/beta antiviral actions as a result of improper IFN-stimulated gene (ISGs) expression. In contrast, HHV-6A-infected cells were responsive to IFN-alpha/beta with pronounced antiviral effects observed. Type II IFN (gamma)-signaling was unaltered in cells infected by either variant. The HHV-6B immediate-early 1 (IE1) physically interacts with STAT2 and sequestrates it to the nucleus. As a consequence, IE1B prevents the binding of ISGF3 to IFN-responsive gene promoters, resulting in ISG silencing. In comparison, HHV-6A and its associated IE1 protein displayed marginal ISG inhibitory activity relative to HHV-6B. The ISG inhibitory domain of IE1B mapped to a 41 amino acid region absent from IE1A. Transfer of this IE1B region resulted in a gain of function that conferred ISG inhibitory activity to IE1A. Our work is unique in demonstrating type I IFN signaling defects in HHV-6B-infected cells and highlights a major biological difference between HHV-6 variants."
19403670,A shared interface mediates paramyxovirus interference with antiviral RNA helicases MDA5 and LGP2.,"Diverse members of the Paramyxovirus family of negative-strand RNA viruses effectively suppress host innate immune responses through the actions of their V proteins. The V protein mediates interference with the interferon regulatory RNA helicase MDA5 to avoid cellular antiviral responses. Analysis of the interaction interface revealed the MDA5 helicase C domain as necessary and sufficient for association with V proteins from human parainfluenza virus type 2, parainfluenza virus type 5, measles virus, mumps virus, Hendra virus, and Nipah virus. The identified approximately 130-residue region is highly homologous between MDA5 and the related antiviral helicase LGP2, but not RIG-I. Results indicate that the paramyxovirus V proteins can also associate with LGP2. The V protein interaction was found to disrupt ATP hydrolysis mediated by both MDA5 and LGP2. These findings provide a potential mechanistic basis for V protein-mediated helicase interference and identify LGP2 as a second cellular RNA helicase targeted by paramyxovirus V proteins."
17314515,"HIV1 Vpr arrests the cell cycle by recruiting DCAF1/VprBP, a receptor of the Cul4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase.","How the HIV1 Vpr protein initiates the host cell response leading to cell cycle arrest in G(2) has remained unknown. Here, we show that recruitment of DCAF1/VprBP by Vpr is essential for its cytostatic activity, which can be abolished either by single mutations of Vpr that impair DCAF1 binding, or by siRNA-mediated silencing of DCAF1. Furthermore, DCAF1 bridges Vpr to DDB1, a core subunit of Cul4 ubiquitin ligases. Altogether these results point to a mechanism where Vpr triggers G(2) arrest by hijacking the Cul4/DDB1(DCAF1) ubiquitin ligase. We further show that, Vpx, a non-cytostatic Vpr-related protein acquired by HIV2 and SIV, also binds DCAF1 through a conserved motif. Thus, Vpr from HIV1 and Vpx from SIV recruit DCAF1 with different physiological outcomes for the host cell. This in turn suggests that both proteins have evolved to preserve interaction with the same Cul4 ubiquitin ligase while diverging in the recognition of host substrates targeted for proteasomal degradation."
9636359,Cyclophilin a modulates processing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 p55Gag: mechanism for antiviral effects of cyclosporin A.,The molecular chaperone cyclophilin A (Cyp A) modulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectivity through its interactions with Gag structural proteins. The molecular mechanism for CypA in HIV-1 replication is not known. We studied chaperone effects on Gag precursor processing using cyclosporin A (CsA) to bind CypA and prevent its interaction with p55Gag. CsA treatment inhibited p55Gag processing in extracellular virus-like particles produced from COS cells. We confirmed the effect of CsA on Gag processing by examining virions produced from CEMx174 cells infected with HIV-1LAI. Particles accumulated in the presence of CsA displayed mostly immature virion morphology and lacked condensed capsids. CsA has a direct effect on HIV-1 Gag processing that implicates CypA as having an important role in the maturation of HIV-1 particles.
24856362,Structural basis for the inhibition of host protein ubiquitination by Shigella effector kinase OspG.,"Shigella invasion of its human host is assisted by T3SS-delivered effector proteins. The OspG effector kinase binds ubiquitin and ubiquitin-loaded E2-conjugating enzymes, including UbcH5b and UbcH7, and attenuates the host innate immune NF-kB signaling. We present the structure of OspG bound to the UbcH7∼Ub conjugate. OspG has a minimal kinase fold lacking the activation loop of regulatory kinases. UbcH7∼Ub binds OspG at sites remote from the kinase active site, yet increases its kinase activity. The ubiquitin is positioned in the ""open"" conformation with respect to UbcH7 using its I44 patch to interact with the C terminus of OspG. UbcH7 binds to OspG using two conserved loops essential for E3 ligase recruitment. The interaction of the UbcH7∼Ub with OspG is remarkably similar to the interaction of an E2∼Ub with a HECT E3 ligase. OspG interferes with the interaction of UbcH7 with the E3 parkin and inhibits the activity of the E3."
11238858,Detection of direct binding of human herpesvirus 8-encoded interleukin-6 (vIL-6) to both gp130 and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and identification of amino acid residues of vIL-6 important for IL-6R-dependent and -independent signaling.,"Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease; in all of these diseases, interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated as a likely mitogenic and/or angiogenic factor. HHV-8 encodes a homologue of IL-6 (viral IL-6 [vIL-6]) that has been shown to be biologically active in several assays and whose activities mirror those of its mammalian counterparts. Like these proteins, vIL-6 mediates its effects through the gp130 signal transducer, but signaling is not dependent on the structurally related IL-6 receptor (IL-6R; gp80) subunit of the receptor-signal transducer complex. However, as we have shown previously, IL-6R can enhance vIL-6 signal transduction and can enable signaling through a gp130 variant (gp130.PM5) that is itself unable to support vIL-6 activity, indicating that IL-6R can form part of the signaling complex. Also, our analysis of a panel of vIL-6 mutants in transfection experiments in Hep3B cells (that express IL-6R and gp130) showed that most were able to function normally in this system. Here, we have used in vitro vIL-6-receptor binding assays to demonstrate direct binding of vIL-6 to both gp130 and IL-6R and vIL-6-induced gp130-IL-6R complex formation, and we have extended our functional analyses of the vIL-6 variants to identify residues important for IL-6R-independent and IL-6R-dependent signaling through native gp130 and gp130.PM5, respectively. These studies have identified residues in vIL-6 that are important for IL-6R-independent and IL-6R-mediated functional complex formation between vIL-6 and gp130 and that may be involved directly in binding to gp130 and IL-6R."
2514776,Interferon-gamma is associated with the surface of the human immunodeficiency virus and binds to the gag gene product p17.,"Purified HIV-1 antigen preparations produced in cell culture were found to contain interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Electron microscopic examination of HIV-1 released by H9 cells, a cell line found to produce IFN-gamma, showed the presence of this molecule on the surface of the virus particle. The HIV-1 protein p17 was found to bind IFN-gamma by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by Western blot analysis. This finding opens new questions about the biologic role of IFN-gamma itself and of its interaction with HIV."
19201886,Specific targeting of the EBV lytic phase protein BNLF2a to the transporter associated with antigen processing results in impairment of HLA class I-restricted antigen presentation.,"EBV persists for life in the human host while facing vigorous antiviral responses that are induced upon primary infection. This persistence supports the idea that herpesviruses have acquired dedicated functions to avoid immune elimination. The recently identified EBV gene product BNLF2a blocks TAP. As a result, reduced amounts of peptides are transported by TAP from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen for binding to newly synthesized HLA class I molecules. Thus, BNLF2a perturbs detection by cytotoxic T cells. The 60-aa-long BNLF2a protein prevents the binding of both peptides and ATP to TAP, yet further mechanistic insight is, to date, lacking. In this study, we report that EBV BNLF2a represents a membrane-associated protein that colocalizes with its target TAP in subcellular compartments, primarily the ER. In cells devoid of TAP, expression levels of BNLF2a protein are greatly diminished, while ER localization of the remaining BNLF2a is retained. For interactions of BNLF2a with the HLA class I peptide-loading complex, the presence of TAP2 is essential, whereas tapasin is dispensible. Importantly, we now show that in B cells supporting EBV lytic replication, the BNLF2a protein is expressed early in infection, colocalizing and associating with the peptide-loading complex. These results imply that, during productive EBV infection, BNLF2a contributes to TAP inhibition and surface HLA class I down-regulation. In this way, EBV BNLF2a-mediated evasion from HLA class I-restricted T cell immunity contributes to creating a window for undetected virus production."
17376915,Nuclear and nucleolar targeting of influenza A virus NS1 protein: striking differences between different virus subtypes.,"Influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1A protein) is a virulence factor which is targeted into the nucleus. It is a multifunctional protein that inhibits host cell pre-mRNA processing and counteracts host cell antiviral responses. We show that the NS1A protein can interact with all six human importin alpha isoforms, indicating that the nuclear translocation of NS1A protein is mediated by the classical importin alpha/beta pathway. The NS1A protein of the H1N1 (WSN/33) virus has only one N-terminal arginine- or lysine-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS1), whereas the NS1A protein of the H3N2 subtype (Udorn/72) virus also has a second C-terminal NLS (NLS2). NLS1 is mapped to residues 35 to 41, which also function in the double-stranded RNA-binding activity of the NS1A protein. NLS2 was created by a 7-amino-acid C-terminal extension (residues 231 to 237) that became prevalent among human influenza A virus types isolated between the years 1950 to 1987. NLS2 includes basic amino acids at positions 219, 220, 224, 229, 231, and 232. Surprisingly, NLS2 also forms a functional nucleolar localization signal NoLS, a function that was retained in H3N2 type virus NS1A proteins even without the C-terminal extension. It is likely that the evolutionarily well-conserved nucleolar targeting function of NS1A protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of influenza A virus."
11080476,Acetylation of HIV-1 Tat by CBP/P300 increases transcription of integrated HIV-1 genome and enhances binding to core histones.,"The HIV-1 Tat protein is required for viral replication and is a potent stimulator of viral transcription. Although Tat has been extensively studied in various reductive paradigms, to date there is little information as to how this activator mediates transcription from natural nucleosomally packaged long terminal repeats. Here we show that CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 interacts with the HIV-1 Tat protein and serves as a coactivator of Tat-dependent HIV-1 gene expression on an integrated HIV-1 provirus. The site of acetylation of Tat was mapped to the double-lysine motif in a highly conserved region, (49)RKKRRQ(54), of the basic RNA-binding motif of Tat. Using HLM1 cells (HIV-1(+)/Tat(-)), which contain a single copy of full-length HIV-1 provirus with a triple termination codon at the first AUG of the Tat gene, we find that only wild type, and not K50A, K51A, or K50A/K51A alone or in combination of ectopic CBP/p300, is able to produce full-length infectious virions, as measured by p24 gag ELISAs. Tat binds CBP/p300 in the minimal histone acetyltransferase domain (1253-1710) and the binding is stable up to 0.85 M salt wash conditions. Interestingly, wild-type peptide 41-54, and not other Tat peptides, changes the conformation of the CBP/p300 such that it can acquire and bind better to basal factors such as TBP and TFIIB, indicating that Tat may influence the transcription machinery by helping CBP/p300 to recruit new partners into the transcription machinery. Finally, using biotinylated wild-type or acetylated peptides, we find that acetylation decreases Tat's ability to bind the TAR RNA element, as well as to bind basal factors such as TBP, CBP, Core-Pol II, or cyclin T. However, the acetylated Tat peptide is able to bind to core histones on a nucleosome assembled HIV-1 proviral DNA."
12208951,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) accessory protein Vpr induces transcription of the HIV-1 and glucocorticoid-responsive promoters by binding directly to p300/CBP coactivators.,"The accessory Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a promiscuous activator of viral and cellular promoters. We report that Vpr enhances expression of the glucocorticoid receptor-induced mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter and of the Tat-induced HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter by directly binding to p300/CBP coactivators. In contrast, Vpr does not bind to p/CAF or to members of the p160 family of nuclear receptor coactivators, such as steroid receptor coactivator 1a and glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-interacting protein 1. Vpr forms a stable complex with p300 and also interacts with the ligand-bound glucocorticoid receptor in vivo. Mutation analysis showed that the C-terminal part of Vpr binds to the C-terminal portion of p300/CBP within amino acids 2045 to 2191. The same p300 region interacts with the p160 coactivators and with the adenovirus E1A protein. Accordingly, E1A competed for binding to p300 in vitro. Coexpression of E1A or of small fragments of p300 containing the Vpr binding site resulted in inhibition of Vpr's transcriptional effects. The C-terminal part of p300 containing the transactivating region is required for Vpr transactivation, whereas the histone acetyltransferase enzymatic region is dispensable. Vpr mutants that bind p300 but not the GR did not activate expression of the MMTV promoter and had dominant-negative effects. These results indicate that Vpr activates transcription by acting as an adapter linking transcription components and coactivators."
12642036,HIV-1 Vpr binding to HIV-1 LTR C/EBP cis-acting elements and adjacent regions is sequence-specific.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral protein R (Vpr) is a 14 kDa virion-associated protein that transactivates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) as well as other eukaryotic promoters. Vpr also functions in nuclear localization and import of the HIV-1 preintegration complex (PIC), cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M interface, and virion packaging. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis has been utilized to demonstrate a direct association between purified Vpr (strain pNL4-3) and HIV-1 LTR sequences that span the adjacent C/EBP site I, NF-kappaB site II, and ATF/CREB binding site (nt -95 to -130, relative to the start of transcription). A similar interaction has been observed between HIV-1 Vpr and LTR C/EBP site II (nt -167 to -175). A total of 94.7% of LTRs derived from peripheral blood contained C/EBP site I variants that displayed a high relative Vpr binding affinity phenotype, while only 5.3% exhibited a low relative Vpr binding affinity phenotype. All LTRs derived from peripheral blood exhibited a high relative Vpr binding phenotype at C/EBP site II. These results suggest a preference for the maintenance of two cis-acting elements with high affinity for Vpr within LTRs derived from peripheral blood. Additional studies have also demonstrated that naturally occurring sequence variation within C/EBP site I and II can dramatically alter the relative affinity of Vpr for these cis-acting elements. These studies suggest that Vpr may regulate the interaction of members of the C/EBP transcription factor family with the viral LTR."
12610111,The STAT2 activation process is a crucial target of Sendai virus C protein for the blockade of alpha interferon signaling.,"Sendai virus (SeV) C protein functions as an interferon (IFN) antagonist and renders cells unresponsive to both alpha/beta IFN (IFN-alpha/beta) and IFN-gamma. We have recently found the physical association of the C protein with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in infected cells. However, involvement of the C-STAT1 interaction in the blockade of IFN signaling has remained unclear. We generated here a series of C mutant proteins that retained or lost the STAT1-binding capacity and examined their effects on IFN-alpha signaling. All of the C mutant proteins with no STAT1-binding capacity lost the ability to inhibit the IFN-alpha response. In contrast, the C mutant proteins retaining the STAT1-binding capacity suppressed IFN-alpha-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT2 and STAT1 to various degrees. Remarkably, their anti-IFN-alpha capacities correlated well with the inhibitory effect on phosphorylation of STAT2 rather than STAT1. In infected cells, the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated (pY) STAT2 were below the detection level irrespective of duration of IFN-alpha stimulation, whereas the levels of pY-STAT1 strikingly increased after long-term IFN-alpha stimulation. These results suggest that the STAT2 activation process is a crucial target for the blockade of IFN-alpha signaling. An in vitro binding assay with extracts from (STAT1-deficient) U3A and (STAT1-expressing) U3A-ST1 cells suggested the requirement of STAT1 for the C-STAT2 interaction. Furthermore, expression of STAT1 enhanced the inhibitory effect of the C protein on STAT2 activation in U3A cells. The C protein thus appears to participate in the inhibitory process for STAT2 activation through the STAT1 interaction."
8806510,Inhibition of HIV-1 replication by cyclosporine A or related compounds correlates with the ability to disrupt the Gag-cyclophilin A interaction.,"The HIV-1 Gag polyprotein specifically incorporates the cellular peptidylprolyl isomerase cyclophilin A into virions. HIV-1 replication is inhibited by cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressive drug which binds with high affinity to cyclophilin A and precludes interaction with the Gag polyprotein. Using a panel of four drugs, including cyclosporine A, two nonimmunosuppressive analogues of cyclosporine A which bind to cyclophilin A but which cannot form a tertiary complex with the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, and the structurally unrelated immunosuppressant FK506, we demonstrated that the antiviral effect of cyclosporine A is not due to blockade of calcineurin-mediated signal transduction pathways. Rather, the effectiveness of cyclosporine A and related compounds at inhibiting HIV-1 replication correlates with cyclophilin A-binding affinity and with the ability to disrupt the interaction between cyclophilin A and the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein. These results support the contention that the Gag-cyclophilin A interaction is required for HIV-1 replication."
8648689,Cyclophilin A is required for an early step in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 before the initiation of reverse transcription.,"Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is incorporated into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions via contact with the Gag polyprotein. Genetic or pharmacologic disruption of CyPA incorporation causes a quantitative reduction in virion infectivity with no discernible effects on virion assembly or on endogenous reverse transcriptase activity. Instead, the reduction of virion-associated CyPA is accompanied by a parallel, quantitative decrease in the initiation of viral DNA synthesis after infection of T cells. The infectivity of CyPA-deficient virions is not restored by pseudotyping with Env of amphotropic murine leukemia virus, demonstrating that CyPA is not required for the HIV-1-Env-CD4 interaction. These results indicate that CyPA is required for an early step in the HIV-1 life cycle following receptor binding and membrane fusion but preceding reverse transcription. CyPA is the first cellular protein other than the cell surface receptor shown to be required for an early event in the life cycle of a retrovirus."
12842892,Active cAMP-dependent protein kinase incorporated within highly purified HIV-1 particles is required for viral infectivity and interacts with viral capsid protein.,"Host cell components, including protein kinases such as ERK-2/mitogen-activated protein kinase, incorporated within human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions play a pivotal role in the ability of HIV to infect and replicate in permissive cells. The present work provides evidence that the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (C-PKA) is packaged within HIV-1 virions as demonstrated using purified subtilisin-digested viral particles. Virus-associated C-PKA was shown to be enzymatically active and able to phosphorylate synthetic substrate in vitro. Suppression of virion-associated C-PKA activity by specific synthetic inhibitor had no apparent effect on viral precursor maturation and virus assembly. However, virus-associated C-PKA activity was demonstrated to regulate HIV-1 infectivity as assessed by single round infection assays performed by using viruses produced from cells expressing an inactive form of C-PKA. In addition, virus-associated C-PKA was found to co-precipitate with and to phosphorylate the CAp24gag protein. Altogether our results indicate that virus-associated C-PKA regulates HIV-1 infectivity, possibly by catalyzing phosphorylation of the viral CAp24gag protein."
16511829,Cooperativity between Rad51 and C/EBP family transcription factors modulates basal and Tat-induced activation of the HIV-1 LTR in astrocytes.,"Transcription of the HIV-1 genome is a complex event that requires functional and physical communication of cellular proteins that recognize the LTR sequence with viral proteins, most notably, Tat. Moreover, studies have revealed the ability of Tat to induce transcription of a variety of cellular genes whose products can affect the status of cells, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of AIDS. Recently, we demonstrated that expression of Tat in astrocytes and other neural cells leads to upregulation of Rad51, a major component of DNA repair via homologous recombination. The unscheduled upregulation of Rad51, in turn, has an impact upon the extent of chromosomal abnormalities that are seen in Tat-producing cells. Here, we asked whether an elevation in Rad51 levels influences the extent of viral gene transcription in astrocytic cells. Our results demonstrate that ectopic expression of Rad51 enhances the basal- and the Tat-induced transcription of the LTR promoter. This event requires cooperativity from the C/EBP family of transcription factors including C/EBPbeta and C/EBPbeta homologous protein (CHOP). Similar to Tat, we showed that Rad51 interacts with C/EBPbeta and augments its interaction with the DNA motif spanning nucleotides -120 to -94 of the LTR. Interestingly, Tat exhibited the capacity to augment the synergism between Rad51 and C/EBPbeta. Our results also demonstrate that the level of activation of the LTR by CHOP and Tat, either alone or together, is elevated in the presence of the SW1/SNF1 chromatin remodeling complex. These observations unravel a new pathway for Tat activation of the LTR that includes the positive feedback loop involving Rad51 and C/EBPbeta family proteins."
7878004,Regulation of human retroviral latency by the NF-kappa B/I kappa B family: inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus replication by I kappa B through a Rev-dependent mechanism.,"The cellular transcription factor NF-kappa B stimulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcriptional initiation, but its role in the retroviral life cycle has not been fully defined. In this report, we show that I kappa B alpha acts as a cellular inhibitor of human retroviral replication through a discrete mechanism, independent of its effect on HIV transcription. I kappa B alpha inhibited HIV replication and gp160 expression by negatively regulating Rev function, most likely acting through a cellular factor involved in Rev transactivation. A similar effect was observed with human T leukemia virus I, in which I kappa B alpha inhibited Rex function. In contrast, no effect was observed on the replication of a DNA virus, adenovirus type 5. The NF-kappa B/I kappa B regulatory pathway therefore modulates human retroviral replication by regulating a program of cellular gene expression required for several steps in the viral life cycle, including not only viral transcription but also RNA export. This interaction between cellular and viral gene products suggests that NF-kappa B plays a broader role in the regulation of human retroviral replication, providing a previously unrecognized link between two important regulators of HIV gene expression and common NF-kappa B-dependent programs of gene expression used by human retroviruses."
12105273,HIV-1 matrix protein p17 increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and counteracts IL-4 activity by binding to a cellular receptor.,"Purified recombinant HIV-1 p17 matrix protein significantly increased HIV-1 replication in preactivated peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures obtained from healthy donors. Because HIV-1 infection and replication is related to cell activation and differentiation status, in the present study, we investigated the role played by p17 during the process of T cell stimulation. Using freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we demonstrate that p17 was able to enhance levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and IFN-gamma released from cells stimulated by IL-2. IL-4 was found to down-regulate IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha, and p17 restored the ability of cells to produce both cytokines. The property of p17 to increase production of proinflammatory cytokines could be a mechanism exploited by the virus to create a more suitable environment for HIV-1 infection and replication. Our data show that p17 exerts its biological activity after binding to a specific cellular receptor expressed on activated T lymphocytes. The functional p17 epitope involved in receptor binding was found to be located at the NH(2)-terminal region of viral protein. Immunization of BALB/c mice with a 14-aa synthetic peptide representative of the HIV-1 p17 functional region (SGGELDRWEKIRLR) resulted in the development of p17 neutralizing antibodies capable of blocking the interaction between p17 and its cellular receptor. Our results define a role for p17 in HIV-1 pathogenesis and contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of HIV-1 infection and the development of additional antiviral therapeutic strategies."
9918876,Phenotype of HIV-1 lacking a functional nuclear localization signal in matrix protein of gag and Vpr is comparable to wild-type HIV-1 in primary macrophages.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is considered to infect nondividing cells because nuclear localization signals (NLS) in matrix (MA, p17(Gag)) and Vpr allow active nuclear transport of the preintegration complex. Previous studies demonstrated that HIV-1 reverse transcription is successful only in cells with proliferative potential, thus restricting HIV-1 replication to cycling cells. To sort out this apparent discrepancy we compared the phenotype of a chimeric HIV-1 variant lacking a functional Vpr and MA-NLS (R7. deltaVpr.deltaNLS), and previously described to lack replicative capacity in macrophages and growth-arrested cells, with a chimera lacking a functional Vpr (R7.deltaVpr). Both variants replicated efficiently in primary macrophages, with only minimal differences in the kinetics of reverse transcription, integration, or p24 production. In agreement with our previous observation, elongation of reverse transcription was restricted to the proliferating subpopulation of macrophages. Replication of R7.deltaVpr and R7.deltaVpr.deltaNLS could also be demonstrated in aphidicolin-treated macrophages, indicating efficient nuclear transport in G1/S phase-arrested cells. In conclusion, our results confirm the dependency of the process of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase on cell proliferation in primary macrophages and exclude an important role of MA-NLS and Vpr in macrophage infection."
9060679,Distinct domains of IkappaB-alpha inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication through NF-kappaB and Rev.,"Among the regulators of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication is the cellular transcription factor NF-kappaB, whose activity is regulated through inhibition by IkappaB family members. We have shown previously that I kappaB-alpha inhibits HIV type 1 (HIV-1) replication, and unexpectedly, IkappaB-alpha was found both to suppress HIV-1 transcription and to inhibit Rev function. The relative contributions and specificities of these mechanisms to HIV replication were unknown. Here, we report that the region of IkappaB-alpha which blocks Rev function is separable from that required for inhibition of NF-kappaB. Molecular mutagenesis revealed that the N terminus of IkappaB-alpha is required for inhibition of Rev function, whereas mutants lacking the N terminus retained the ability to inhibit NF-kappaB function. Interestingly, the nuclear export sequence of IkappaB-alpha was not required for inhibition of Rev or NF-kappaB function in mammalian transfection assays. Conversely, the C terminus of IkappaB-alpha was not required for the inhibition of Rev, while deletion of this region resulted in a loss of NF-kappaB inhibition. Another IkappaB family member with a distinct amino-terminal sequence, IkappaB-beta, inhibited NF-kappaB but not Rev function. These studies indicate that the inhibition of Rev by IkappaB-alpha is independent of NF-kappaB. Mutants defective in inhibition of either Rev or NF-kappaB retained the ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication, suggesting that both functions may contribute to the inhibition of HIV replication by I kappaB-alpha."
24852021,BCA2/Rabring7 targets HIV-1 Gag for lysosomal degradation in a tetherin-independent manner.,"BCA2 (Rabring7, RNF115 or ZNF364) is a RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that was identified as a co-factor in the restriction imposed by tetherin/BST2 on HIV-1. Contrary to the current model, in which BCA2 lacks antiviral activity in the absence of tetherin, we found that BCA2 possesses tetherin-independent antiviral activity. Here we show that the N-terminus of BCA2 physically interacts with the Matrix region of HIV-1 and other retroviral Gag proteins and promotes their ubiquitination, redistribution to endo-lysosomal compartments and, ultimately, lysosomal degradation. The targeted depletion of BCA2 in tetherin-expressing and tetherin-deficient cells results in a significant increase in virus release and replication, indicating that endogenous BCA2 possesses antiviral activity. Therefore, these results indicate that BCA2 functions as an antiviral factor that targets HIV-1 Gag for degradation, impairing virus assembly and release."
26865630,Distinct Activation Mechanisms of NF-κB Regulator Inhibitor of NF-κB Kinase (IKK) by Isoforms of the Cell Death Regulator Cellular FLICE-like Inhibitory Protein (cFLIP).,"The viral FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) protein from Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus activates the NF-κB pathway by forming a stable complex with a central region (amino acids 150-272) of the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK) γ subunits, thereby activating IKK. Cellular FLIP (cFLIP) forms are also known to activate the NF-κB pathway via IKK activation. Here we demonstrate that cFLIPL, cFLIPS, and their proteolytic product p22-FLIP all require the C-terminal region of NEMO/IKKγ (amino acids 272-419) and its ubiquitin binding function for activation of the IKK kinase (or kinase complex), but none form a stable complex with IKKγ. Our results further reveal that cFLIPLrequires the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex and the kinase TAK1 for activation of the IKK kinase. Similarly, cFLIPSand p22-FLIP also require TAK1 but do not require LUBAC. In contrast, these isoforms are both components of complexes that incorporate Fas-associated death domain and RIP1, which appear essential for kinase activation. This conservation of IKK activation among the cFLIP family using different mechanisms suggests that the mechanism plays a critical role in their function."
25170080,HIV-1 protein Nef inhibits activity of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 by targeting endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin.,"HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of developing atherosclerosis, in part due to an altered high density lipoprotein profile exacerbated by down-modulation and impairment of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) activity by the HIV-1 protein Nef. However, the mechanisms of this Nef effect remain unknown. Here, we show that Nef interacts with an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin, which regulates folding and maturation of glycosylated proteins. Nef disrupted interaction between calnexin and ABCA1 but increased affinity and enhanced interaction of calnexin with HIV-1 gp160. The Nef mutant that did not bind to calnexin did not affect the calnexin-ABCA1 interaction. Interaction with calnexin was essential for functionality of ABCA1, as knockdown of calnexin blocked the ABCA1 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, reduced ABCA1 abundance, and inhibited cholesterol efflux; the same effects were observed after Nef overexpression. However, the effects of calnexin knockdown and Nef on cholesterol efflux were not additive; in fact, the combined effect of these two factors together did not differ significantly from the effect of calnexin knockdown alone. Interestingly, gp160 and ABCA1 interacted with calnexin differently; although gp160 binding to calnexin was dependent on glycosylation, glycosylation was of little importance for the interaction between ABCA1 and calnexin. Thus, Nef regulates the activity of calnexin to stimulate its interaction with gp160 at the expense of ABCA1. This study identifies a mechanism for Nef-dependent inactivation of ABCA1 and dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism."
23001005,The APOBEC3C crystal structure and the interface for HIV-1 Vif binding.,"The human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3, referred to as A3) proteins are cellular cytidine deaminases that potently restrict retrovirus replication. However, HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) counteracts the antiviral activity of most A3 proteins by targeting them for proteasomal degradation. To date, the structure of an A3 protein containing a Vif-binding interface has not been solved. Here, we report a high-resolution crystal structure of APOBEC3C and identify the HIV-1 Vif-interaction interface. Extensive structure-guided mutagenesis revealed the role of a shallow cavity composed of hydrophobic or negatively charged residues between the α2 and α3 helices. This region is distant from the DPD motif (residues 128-130) of APOBEC3G that participates in HIV-1 Vif interaction. These findings provide insight into Vif-A3 interactions and could lead to the development of new pharmacologic anti-HIV-1 compounds."
24514761,Fragile X mental retardation protein stimulates ribonucleoprotein assembly of influenza A virus.,"The ribonucleoprotein (RNP) of the influenza A virus is responsible for the transcription and replication of viral RNA in the nucleus. These processes require interplay between host factors and RNP components. Here, we report that the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) targets influenza virus RNA synthesis machinery and facilitates virus replication both in cell culture and in mice. We demonstrate that FMRP transiently associates with viral RNP and stimulates viral RNP assembly through RNA-mediated interaction with the nucleoprotein. Furthermore, the KH2 domain of FMRP mediates its association with the nucleoprotein. A point mutation (I304N) in the KH2 domain, identified from a Fragile X syndrome patient, disrupts the FMRP-nucleoprotein association and abolishes the ability of FMRP to participate in viral RNP assembly. We conclude that FMRP is a critical host factor used by influenza viruses to facilitate viral RNP assembly. Our observation reveals a mechanism of influenza virus RNA synthesis and provides insights into FMRP functions."
26311876,"A Nucleolar Protein, Ribosomal RNA Processing 1 Homolog B (RRP1B), Enhances the Recruitment of Cellular mRNA in Influenza Virus Transcription.","Influenza A virus (IAV) undergoes RNA transcription by a unique capped-mRNA-dependent transcription, which is carried out by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), consisting of the viral PA, PB1, and PB2 proteins. However, how the viral RdRp utilizes cellular factors for virus transcription is not clear. Previously, we conducted a genome-wide pooled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen to identify host factors important for influenza A virus replication. Ribosomal RNA processing 1 homolog B (RRP1B) was identified as one of the candidates. RRP1B is a nucleolar protein involved in ribosomal biogenesis. Upon IAV infection, part of RRP1B was translocated from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, where viral RNA synthesis likely takes place. The depletion of RRP1B significantly reduced IAV mRNA transcription in a minireplicon assay and in virus-infected cells. Furthermore, we showed that RRP1B interacted with PB1 and PB2 of the RdRp and formed a coimmunoprecipitable complex with RdRp. The depletion of RRP1B reduced the amount of capped mRNA in the RdRp complex. Taken together, these findings indicate that RRP1B is a host factor essential for IAV transcription and provide a target for new antivirals."
17301785,Structural definition of a conserved neutralization epitope on HIV-1 gp120.,"The remarkable diversity, glycosylation and conformational flexibility of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env), including substantial rearrangement of the gp120 glycoprotein upon binding the CD4 receptor, allow it to evade antibody-mediated neutralization. Despite this complexity, the HIV-1 Env must retain conserved determinants that mediate CD4 binding. To evaluate how these determinants might provide opportunities for antibody recognition, we created variants of gp120 stabilized in the CD4-bound state, assessed binding of CD4 and of receptor-binding-site antibodies, and determined the structure at 2.3 A resolution of the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 in complex with gp120. b12 binds to a conformationally invariant surface that overlaps a distinct subset of the CD4-binding site. This surface is involved in the metastable attachment of CD4, before the gp120 rearrangement required for stable engagement. A site of vulnerability, related to a functional requirement for efficient association with CD4, can therefore be targeted by antibody to neutralize HIV-1."
21893288,Structural basis for complex formation between human IRSp53 and the translocated intimin receptor Tir of enterohemorrhagic E. coli.,"Actin assembly beneath enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) attached to its host cell is triggered by the intracellular interaction of its translocated effector proteins Tir and EspF(U) with human IRSp53 family proteins and N-WASP. Here, we report the structure of the N-terminal I-BAR domain of IRSp53 in complex with a Tir-derived peptide, in which the homodimeric I-BAR domain binds two Tir molecules aligned in parallel. This arrangement provides a protein scaffold linking the bacterium to the host cell's actin polymerization machinery. The structure uncovers a specific peptide-binding site on the I-BAR surface, conserved between IRSp53 and IRTKS. The Tir Asn-Pro-Tyr (NPY) motif, essential for pedestal formation, is specifically recognized by this binding site. The site was confirmed by mutagenesis and in vivo-binding assays. It is possible that IRSp53 utilizes the NPY-binding site for additional interactions with as yet unknown partners within the host cell."
20529865,Uncoating of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 requires prolyl isomerase Pin1.,"The process by which the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) conical core dissociates is called uncoating, but not much is known about this process. Here, we show that the uncoating process requires the interaction of the capsid (CA) protein with the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated serine/threonine residue followed by proline. We found that the HIV-1 core is composed of some isoforms of the CA protein with different isoelectric points, and one isoform is preferentially phosphorylated in the Ser(16)-Pro(17) motif. The mutant virus S16A/P17A shows a severely attenuated HIV-1 replication and an impaired reverse transcription. The S16A/P17A change increased the amount of particulate CA cores in the cytosol of target cells and correlated with the restriction of HIV-1 infection. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays demonstrated a direct interaction between Pin1 and the HIV-1 core via the Ser(16)-Pro(17) motif. Suppression of Pin1 expression by RNA interference in a target cell results in an attenuated HIV-1 replication and increases the amount of particulate CA cores in the cytosol of target cells. Furthermore, heat-inactivated, inhibitor-treated, or W34A/K63A Pin1 causes an attenuated in vitro uncoating of the HIV-1 core. The Pin1-dependent uncoating is inhibited by antisera raised against a CA peptide phosphorylated at Ser(16) or treatment of the HIV-1 core with alkaline phosphatase. These findings provide insights into this obscure uncoating process in the HIV-1 life cycle and a new cellular target for HIV-1 drug development."
22419161,Suppression of the antiviral response by an influenza histone mimic.,"Viral infection is commonly associated with virus-driven hijacking of host proteins. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which influenza virus affects host cells through the interaction of influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) with the infected cell epigenome. We show that the NS1 protein of influenza A H3N2 subtype possesses a histone-like sequence (histone mimic) that is used by the virus to target the human PAF1 transcription elongation complex (hPAF1C). We demonstrate that binding of NS1 to hPAF1C depends on the NS1 histone mimic and results in suppression of hPAF1C-mediated transcriptional elongation. Furthermore, human PAF1 has a crucial role in the antiviral response. Loss of hPAF1C binding by NS1 attenuates influenza infection, whereas hPAF1C deficiency reduces antiviral gene expression and renders cells more susceptible to viruses. We propose that the histone mimic in NS1 enables the influenza virus to affect inducible gene expression selectively, thus contributing to suppression of the antiviral response."
22872640,Interaction of the HIV-1 intasome with transportin 3 protein (TNPO3 or TRN-SR2).,"Transportin 3 (TNPO3 or TRN-SR2) has been shown to be an important cellular factor for early steps of lentiviral replication. However, separate studies have implicated distinct mechanisms for TNPO3 either through its interaction with HIV-1 integrase or capsid. Here we have carried out a detailed biophysical characterization of TNPO3 and investigated its interactions with viral proteins. Biophysical analyses including circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation, small-angle x-ray scattering, and homology modeling provide insight into TNPO3 architecture and indicate that it is highly structured and exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution. In vitro biochemical binding assays argued against meaningful direct interaction between TNPO3 and the capsid cores. Instead, TNPO3 effectively bound to the functional intasome but not to naked viral DNA, suggesting that TNPO3 can directly engage the HIV-1 IN tetramer prebound to the cognate DNA. Mass spectrometry-based protein footprinting and site-directed mutagenesis studies have enabled us to map several interacting amino acids in the HIV-1 IN C-terminal domain and the cargo binding domain of TNPO3. Our findings provide important information for future genetic analysis to better understand the role of TNPO3 and its interacting partners for HIV-1 replication."
18266467,Inhibition of IkappaB kinase by vaccinia virus virulence factor B14.,"The IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex is a key regulator of signal transduction pathways leading to the induction of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It therefore represents a major target for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutic drugs and may be targeted by pathogens seeking to diminish the host response to infection. Previously, the vaccinia virus (VACV) strain Western Reserve B14 protein was characterised as an intracellular virulence factor that alters the inflammatory response to infection by an unknown mechanism. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of B14 inhibited NF-kappaB activation in response to TNFalpha, IL-1beta, poly(I:C), and PMA. In cells infected with VACV lacking gene B14R (vDeltaB14) there was a higher level of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha but a similar level of IkappaBalpha compared to cells infected with control viruses expressing B14, suggesting B14 affects IKK activity. Direct evidence for this was obtained by showing that B14 co-purified and co-precipitated with the endogenous IKK complex from human and mouse cells and inhibited IKK complex enzymatic activity. Notably, the interaction between B14 and the IKK complex required IKKbeta but not IKKalpha, suggesting the interaction occurs via IKKbeta. B14 inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by overexpression of IKKalpha, IKKbeta, and a constitutively active mutant of IKKalpha, S176/180E, but did not inhibit a comparable mutant of IKKbeta, S177/181E. This suggested that phosphorylation of these serine residues in the activation loop of IKKbeta is targeted by B14, and this was confirmed using Ab specific for phospho-IKKbeta."
9376596,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax transactivates the promoter of human prointerleukin-1beta gene through association with two transcription factors, nuclear factor-interleukin-6 and Spi-1.","The human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), which infects a wide variety of mammalian cells including monocytes and macrophages, encodes a transactivating protein designated as Tax. We now report that Tax induces the human prointerleukin-1beta (IL1B) gene promoter in monocytic cells. In our transient transfection assays using human THP-1 monocytic cells, a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct containing the IL1B promoter sequence between positions -131 and +12 showed an approximately 90-fold increase in activity following cotransfection of a Tax expression vector. Moreover, Tax synergized with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce the IL1B promoter activity. Analyses of specific nucleotide substitutions further indicated that the Tax-induced transcriptional activation requires two transcription factor binding motifs within the IL1B promoter; one is a binding site for nuclear factor (NF)-IL6 (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta, C/EBP beta), which belongs to the basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) family and the other for Spi-1 (PU.1), which is an Ets family protein found principally in monocytes, macrophages, and B lymphocytes. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using in vivo THP-1 nuclear extracts, Tax expression in THP-1 monocytic cells significantly increased binding of the two factors to their target IL1B promoter sequences. However, in contrast to NF-IL6 and Spi-1, DNA binding activity of Oct-1, an ubiquitously expressed octamer-binding protein was not affected by Tax. Additional EMSA using in vitro translated proteins also showed that recombinant Tax enhances DNA binding of both of recombinant NF-IL6 and Spi-1 proteins. These data were supported by our glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pull-down data, which indicated that Tax physically interacts with the two proteins. Based on the results obtained from the present study, we conclude that the IL1B promoter is a Tax-responsive sequence as a result of ability of Tax to induce binding of NF-IL6 and Spi-1 to the IL1B promoter sequence through protein-protein interaction."
12904943,Acetylation of the HIV-1 Tat protein: an in vitro study.,"In the last few years, the understanding of lysine acetylation as a regulatory post-translational modification of proteins in cell signalling cascades has increased. It is now known that not only histones but also non-histone factors can serve as substrates of different acetyltransferase enzymes. Acetylated lysine residues in non-histone factors are often identified using radioactive labelling experiments and immunochemical analysis of synthetic peptides. In this study of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein, we demonstrate the benefits of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry, proteolytic digestion and Edman sequencing for the mapping of acetylation sites. We confirmed that the HIV-1 Tat protein is acetylated in vitro by the acetyltransferase p300 at a specific lysine residue at position 50 in its RNA binding region. Furthermore, we showed that the Tat cysteine-rich region is acetylated at multiple cysteine residues in the absence of enzyme. Since this non-enzymatic cysteine acetylation occurs independently from the surrounding peptide sequence, we consider the presence of cysteine residues in acetylated peptides an important factor for the interpretation of in vitro acetylation assays in general."
11689053,Enhancement of the p300 HAT activity by HIV-1 Tat on chromatin DNA.,"HIV-1 Tat is able to form a ternary complex with P/CAF and p300 and increase the affinity for CDK9/P-TEFb CTD kinase complex. Our previous study demonstrated that Tat binds to p300/CBP in the minimal HAT domain (aa 1253-1790) and that the interaction results in a change of conformation on p300/CBP. Here, we show that the Tat-p300 interaction increases the HAT activity of p300 on histone H4 that is associated with nucleosomal DNA and not with free histones. Nucleosomal histone H4 was acetylated on lysines 8, 12, and 16. Acetylation of H4 was inhibited by Lys-coenzyme A (CoA), a selective inhibitor of p300 acetyltransferase activity. Unexpectedly, we also found that Tat could autoacetylate itself, which was specific to lysine residues 41 and 71. Peptides lacking these two lysines could not enhance the HAT activity of p300. Comparison of the sequences of Tat with other HIV-1 clades and HAT containing transcription factors indicated sequence identity in the acetyl-CoA binding motif A, KGXG. Furthermore, when utilizing an in vitro transcription assay, as well as a Tat mutant virus, we found that ectopic expression of only wild-type Tat in the presence of p300, and not a lysine 41 Tat mutant, could activate HIV-1 chromatin DNA, as evidenced by the absence of HIV-1 virion antigen. Therefore, transcription of integrated viral DNA in vivo requires the HAT activity of coactivators that are modulated by Tat to derepress the HIV-1 chromatin structure and aid in activated transcription."
10607594,Acetylation of the HIV-1 Tat protein by p300 is important for its transcriptional activity.,"The human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein activates transcriptional elongation by recruiting the positive transcription elongation factor (pTEFb) complex to the TAR RNA element, which is located at the 5' extremity of all viral transcripts [1-3]. Tat also associates in vitro and in vivo with the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP [4-6]. This association has been proposed to recruit the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of p300 to the integrated HIV-1 promoter. We have observed that the purified p300 HAT domain acetylates recombinant Tat proteins in vitro and that Tat is acetylated in vivo. The major targets of acetylation by p300 are lysine residues (Lys50 and Lys51) in the arginine-rich motif (ARM) used by Tat to bind RNA and for nuclear import. Mutation of these residues in full-length recombinant Tat blocked its acetylation in vitro. Furthermore, mutation of these lysine residues to arginine markedly decreased the synergistic activation of he HIV promoter by Tat and p300 or by Tat and cyclin T1. These results demonstrate that acetylation of Tat by p300/CBP is important for its transcriptional activation of the HIV promoter."
9733796,Activation of integrated provirus requires histone acetyltransferase. p300 and P/CAF are coactivators for HIV-1 Tat.,"A unique aspect of the retrovirus life cycle is the obligatory integration of the provirus into host cell chromosomes. Unlike viruses that do not integrate, retroviruses must conserve an ability to activate transcription from a chromatin context. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 encodes an unusual and an unusually potent transcriptional transactivator, Tat, which binds to a nascent viral leader RNA, TAR. The action of Tat has been well studied in various reductive model systems; however, the physiological mechanism through which Tat gains access to chromatin-associated proviral long terminal repeats (LTRs) is not understood. We show here that a nuclear histone acetyltransferase activity associates with Tat. Intracellularly, we found that Tat forms a ternary complex with p300 and P/CAF, two histone acetyltransferases (HATs). A murine cell defect in Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR was linked to the reduced abundance of p300 and P/CAF. Thus, overexpression of p300 and P/CAF reconstituted Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR in NIH3T3 cells to a level similar to that observed for human cells. By using transdominant p300 or P/CAF mutants that lack enzymatic activity, we delineated a requirement for the HAT component from the latter but not the former in Tat function. Finally, we observed that Tat-associated HAT is preferentially important for transactivation of integrated, but not unintegrated, HIV-1 LTR."
10545121,HIV-1 tat transcriptional activity is regulated by acetylation.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) trans- activator protein, Tat, stimulates transcription from the viral long-terminal repeats (LTR) through an RNA hairpin element, trans-activation responsive region (TAR). We and others have shown that trans-activator protein (Tat)-associated histone acetyltransferases (TAHs), p300 and p300/CBP-associating factor (PCAF), assist functionally in the activation of chromosomally integrated HIV-1 LTR. Here, we show that p300 and PCAF also directly acetylate Tat. We defined two sites of acetylation located in different functional domains of Tat. p300 acetylated Lys50 in the TAR RNA binding domain, while PCAF acetylated Lys28 in the activation domain of Tat. In support of a functional role for acetylation in vivo, histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin A) synergized with Tat in transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR. Synergism was TAR-dependent and required the intact presence of both Lys28 and Lys50. Mechanistically, acetylation at Lys28 by PCAF enhanced Tat binding to the Tat-associated kinase, CDK9/P-TEFb, while acetylation by p300 at Lys50 of Tat promoted the dissociation of Tat from TAR RNA that occurs during early transcription elongation. These data suggest that acetylation of Tat regulates two discrete and functionally critical steps in transcription, binding to an RNAP II CTD-kinase and release of Tat from TAR RNA."
18580066,TAF1 interacts with and modulates human papillomavirus 16 E2-dependent transcriptional regulation.,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main etiological factor in the development of cervical cancer and viral type 16 is the most frequently found in this neoplasia. The E2 protein plays a key role in viral DNA replication, transcription and genome maintenance. E2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that activates or represses the transcriptional activity of promoters depending on the distance from the E2-binding sites to the TATA box. The transactivation properties of E2 are modulated by the interaction with several cellular factors that regulate the recruitment of transcription factor IID. Here, we demonstrate by pull-down assays the in vitro interaction of HPV16 E2 and TAF1. The domain of TAF1 necessary for the binding maps into its amino region, while the carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domain and the transactivation domain of the E2 protein are involved in the interaction. By transient cotransfection assays on C-33 A cells, we demonstrated that TAF1 enhances the activation of an E2-dependent artificial promoter while overexpression of TAF1 alleviates the E2-dependent repression of a high-risk HPV long control region. The specific modification of the transcriptional activity of both promoters by TAF1 suggests that the interaction between these proteins could participate in the modulation of the transregulatory properties of E2, with important biological consequences."
9463369,Viral protein R regulates nuclear import of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex.,"Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in non-dividing cells critically depends on import of the viral pre-integration complex into the nucleus. Genetic evidence suggests that viral protein R (Vpr) and matrix antigen (MA) are directly involved in the import process. An in vitro assay that reconstitutes nuclear import of HIV-1 pre-integration complexes in digitonin-permeabilized cells was used to demonstrate that Vpr is the key regulator of the viral nuclear import process. Mutant HIV-1 pre-integration complexes that lack Vpr failed to be imported in vitro, whereas mutants that lack a functional MA nuclear localization sequence (NLS) were only partially defective. Strikingly, the import defect of the Vpr- mutant was rescued when recombinant Vpr was re-added. In addition, import of Vpr- virus was rescued by adding the cytosol of HeLa cells, where HIV-1 replication had been shown to be Vpr-independent. In a solution binding assay, Vpr associated with karyopherin alpha, a cellular receptor for NLSs. This association increased the affinity of karyopherin alpha for basic-type NLSs, including that of MA, thus explaining the positive effect of Vpr on nuclear import of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex and BSA-NLS conjugates. These results identify the biochemical mechanism of Vpr function in transport of the viral pre-integration complex to, and across, the nuclear membrane."
7568168,"A protein-binding domain, EH, identified in the receptor tyrosine kinase substrate Eps15 and conserved in evolution.","In this report we structurally and functionally define a binding domain that is involved in protein association and that we have designated EH (for Eps15 homology domain). This domain was identified in the tyrosine kinase substrate Eps15 on the basis of regional conservation with several heterogeneous proteins of yeast and nematode. The EH domain spans about 70 amino acids and shows approximately 60% overall amino acid conservation. We demonstrated the ability of the EH domain to specifically bind cytosolic proteins in normal and malignant cells of mesenchymal, epithelial, and hematopoietic origin. These observations prompted our search for additional EH-containing proteins in mammalian cells. Using an EH domain-specific probe derived from the eps15 cDNA, we cloned and characterized a cDNA encoding an EH-containing protein with overall similarity to Eps15; we designated this protein Eps15r (for Eps15-related). Structural comparison of Eps15 and Eps15r defines a family of signal transducers possessing extensive networking abilities including EH-mediated binding and association with Src homology 3-containing proteins."
9892698,A role for RNA helicase A in post-transcriptional regulation of HIV type 1.,"Retroviruses must bypass the tight coupling of splicing and nuclear export of mRNA in their replication cycle because unspliced genomic RNA and incompletely spliced mRNA must be exported to the cytoplasm for packaging or translation. This process is mediated by a cis-acting constitutive transport element (CTE) for simple retroviruses and by the trans-acting viral protein Rev in concert with its response element (RRE) for complex retroviruses (e.g., HIV). Recently, we identified RNA helicase A (RHA) as a potential cellular cofactor for CTE. Here, we report that RHA also plays a role in Rev/RRE-mediated gene expression and HIV replication. RHA binds weakly to HIV-1 RRE independently of Rev. Overexpression of RHA, but not of an RHA mutant lacking helicase activity, increased both Rev/RRE- and CTE-dependent gene expression and the levels of unspliced HIV mRNA. Microinjection of antibodies to RHA into nuclei dramatically inhibited both CTE- and Rev-dependent gene expression in human cells. Exogenous RHA cDNA, but not the mutant RHA, rescued this inhibition. We propose that RHA is required to release both CTE- and RRE-containing mRNA from spliceosomes before completion of splicing, thus freeing them for nuclear export."
11172097,"Fully functional, naturally occurring and C-terminally truncated variant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Vif does not bind to HIV Gag but influences intermediate filament structure.","A variant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vif gene, vifA45-2, which encodes a protein lacking 19 amino acids at the C terminus but which is fully functional in supporting HIV replication in non-permissive cells has been described previously. By employing newly generated anti-VifA45 serum, further properties of VifA45 and its full-length counterpart, VifA45open, in comparison to Vif from HIV strain BH10 are reported in permissive HeLa and COS-7 cells. The results obtained using confocal microscopic localization studies and in vitro binding assays do not support a requirement for the direct interaction of HIV Gag with Vif. Furthermore and in contrast to previous conclusions, detergent solubility analyses do not demonstrate a role for the C terminus of Vif in mediating localization to the fraction containing cellular membrane proteins. Localization of Vif from HIV strain BH10 to perinuclear aggregates in a small fraction (about 10%) of transfected HeLa cells has been previously reported. The intermediate filament protein vimentin colocalizes to these structures. In contrast, VifA45 and VifA45open form perinuclear aggregates in nearly all transfected HeLa cells; vimentin as well as the cytoskeletal-bridging protein plectin, but not the microtubular protein tubulin, become relocalized to these structures. Interestingly, in COS-7 cells, all of the functional Vif proteins tested (Vif from strain BH10, VifA45 and VifA45open) predominantly localize in the cytoplasm but still induce dramatic aggregation of vimentin and plectin, i.e. in these cells the respective Vif proteins are influencing intermediate filament structure in the absence of colocalization."
22090097,Transmembrane domain determinants of CD4 Downregulation by HIV-1 Vpu.,"The transmembrane domains (TMDs) of integral membrane proteins do not merely function as membrane anchors but play active roles in many important biological processes. The downregulation of the CD4 coreceptor by the Vpu protein of HIV-1 is a prime example of a process that is dependent on specific properties of TMDs. Here we report the identification of Trp22 in the Vpu TMD and Gly415 in the CD4 TMD as critical determinants of Vpu-induced targeting of CD4 to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD). The two residues participate in different aspects of ERAD targeting. Vpu Trp22 is required to prevent assembly of Vpu into an inactive, oligomeric form and to promote CD4 polyubiquitination and subsequent recruitment of the VCP-UFD1L-NPL4 dislocase complex. In the presence of a Vpu Trp22 mutant, CD4 remains integrally associated with the ER membrane, suggesting that dislocation from the ER into the cytosol is impaired. CD4 Gly415, on the other hand, contributes to CD4-Vpu interactions. We also identify two residues, Val20 and Ser23, in the Vpu TMD that mediate retention of Vpu and, by extension, CD4 in the ER. These findings highlight the exploitation of several TMD-mediated mechanisms by HIV-1 Vpu in order to downregulate CD4 and thus promote viral pathogenesis."
27698494,Regulation of the Abundance of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus ORF50 Protein by Oncoprotein MDM2.,"The switch between latency and the lytic cycle of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is controlled by the expression of virally encoded ORF50 protein. Thus far, the regulatory mechanism underlying the protein stability of ORF50 is unknown. Our earlier studies have demonstrated that a protein abundance regulatory signal (PARS) at the ORF50 C-terminal region modulates its protein abundance. The PARS region consists of PARS-I (aa 490-535) and PARS-II (aa 590-650), and mutations in either component result in abundant expression of ORF50. Here, we show that ORF50 protein is polyubiquitinated and its abundance is controlled through the proteasomal degradation pathway. The PARS-I motif mainly functions as a nuclear localization signal in the control of ORF50 abundance, whereas the PARS-II motif is required for the binding of ubiquitin enzymes in the nucleus. We find that human oncoprotein MDM2, an ubiquitin E3 ligase, is capable of interacting with ORF50 and promoting ORF50 degradation in cells. The interaction domains between both proteins are mapped to the PARS region of ORF50 and the N-terminal 220-aa region of MDM2. Additionally, we identify lysine residues at positions 152 and 154 in the N-terminal domain of ORF50 critically involved in MDM2-mediated downregulation of ORF50 levels. Within KSHV-infected cells, the levels of MDM2 were greatly reduced during viral lytic cycle and genetic knockdown of MDM2 in these cells favored the enhancement of ORF50 expression, supporting that MDM2 is a negative regulator of ORF50 expression. Collectively, the study elucidates the regulatory mechanism of ORF50 stability and implicates that MDM2 may have a significant role in the maintenance of viral latency by lowering basal level of ORF50."
25772236,PML isoforms IV and V contribute to adenovirus-mediated oncogenic transformation by functionally inhibiting the tumor-suppressor p53.,"Although modulation of the cellular tumor-suppressor p53 is considered to have the major role in E1A/E1B-55K-mediated tumorigenesis, other promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB)/PML oncogenic domain (POD)-associated factors including SUMO, Mre11, Daxx, as well as the integrity of these nuclear bodies contribute to the transformation process. However, the biochemical consequences and oncogenic alterations of PML-associated E1B-55K by SUMO-dependent PML-IV and PML-V interaction have so far remained elusive. We performed mutational analysis to define a PML interaction motif within the E1B-55K polypeptide. Our results showed that E1B-55K/PML binding is not required for p53, Mre11 and Daxx interaction. We also observed that E1B-55K lacking subnuclear PML localization because of either PML-IV or PML-V-binding deficiency was no longer capable of mediating E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53, inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation or efficiently transforming primary rodent cells. These results together with the observation that E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53 is required for efficient cell transformation, provides evidence for the idea that the SUMO ligase activity of the E1B-55K viral oncoprotein is intimately linked to its growth-promoting oncogenic activities."
10873769,Detection of the human herpesvirus 8-encoded cyclin protein in primary effusion lymphoma-derived cell lines.,"The human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8/KSHV), along with certain other herpesviruses, encodes a gene with cyclin homology. Although the functional significance of the encoded cyclin is not clear at present, various lines of evidence propose a role for this cyclin in latently infected cells and possibly in the induction of tumors that arise in HHV8-infected individuals. We provide evidence here that the cyclin protein is expressed in HHV8 positive primary effusion lymphoma (PEL)-derived cell lines and that its level of expression varies greatly between different lines. Our analysis indicates that the level of cyclin protein expression in different PEL cell lines may correlate with the level of transcript expression during latency but not in cells induced to undergo lytic replication. In highly expressing BC-3 cells the cyclin is complexed with cdk6, cdk4, cdk2, and cdk5 under both latent and lytic conditions, although subtle changes in the level of cdk association are seen after induction of the lytic cycle. Altogether our findings support the notion that the cyclin is a latency-associated gene product expressed in PEL tumor cells. They furthermore indicate that after lytic cycle induction, the level of cyclin transcript expression may not be a reliable indicator for the level of cyclin protein expression."
17412836,Dynamin 2 is required for the enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity by Nef.,"Nef is a virulence factor of HIV-1 and other primate lentiviruses that is crucial for rapid progression to AIDS. In cell culture, Nef increases the infectivity of HIV-1 progeny virions by an unknown mechanism. We now show that dynamin 2 (Dyn2), a key regulator of vesicular trafficking, is a binding partner of Nef that is required for its ability to increase viral infectivity. Dominant-negative Dyn2 or the depletion of Dyn2 by small interfering RNA potently inhibited the effect of Nef on HIV-1 infectivity. Furthermore, in Dyn2-depleted cells, this function of Nef could be rescued by ectopically expressed Dyn2 but not by Dyn1, a closely related isoform that does not bind Nef. The infectivity enhancement by Nef also depended on clathrin, because it was diminished in clathrin-depleted cells and profoundly inhibited in cells expressing the clathrin-binding domain of AP180, which blocks clathrin-coated pit formation but not clathrin-independent endocytosis. Together, these findings imply that the infectivity enhancement activity of Nef depends on Dyn2- and clathrin-mediated membrane invagination events."
23741449,DDX5 facilitates HIV-1 replication as a cellular co-factor of Rev.,"HIV-1 Rev plays an important role in the late phase of HIV-1 replication, which facilitates export of unspliced viral mRNAs from the nucleus to cytoplasm in infected cells. Recent studies have shown that DDX1 and DDX3 are co-factors of Rev for the export of HIV-1 transcripts. In this report, we have demonstrated that DDX5 (p68), which is a multifunctional DEAD-box RNA helicase, functions as a new cellular co-factor of HIV-1 Rev. We found that DDX5 affects Rev function through the Rev-RRE axis and subsequently enhances HIV-1 replication. Confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that DDX5 binds to Rev and this interaction is largely dependent on RNA. If the DEAD-box motif of DDX5 is mutated, DDX5 loses almost all of its ability to bind to Rev, indicating that the DEAD-box motif of DDX5 is required for the interaction between DDX5 and Rev. Our data indicate that interference of DDX5-Rev interaction could reduce HIV-1 replication and potentially provide a new molecular target for anti-HIV-1 therapeutics."
20010814,A bacterial E3 ubiquitin ligase IpaH9.8 targets NEMO/IKKgamma to dampen the host NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory response.,"NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) has a pivotal role in many cellular processes, including the inflammatory and immune responses and, therefore, its activation is tightly regulated by the IKK (IkappaB kinase) complex and by IkappaBalpha degradation. When Shigella bacteria multiply within epithelial cells they release peptidoglycans, which are recognized by Nod1 and stimulate the NF-kappaB pathway, thus leading to a severe inflammatory response. Here, we show that IpaH9.8, a Shigella effector possessing E3 ligase activity, dampens the NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory response to the bacterial infection in a unique way. IpaH9.8 interacts with NEMO/IKKgamma and ABIN-1, a ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein, promoting ABIN-1-dependent polyubiquitylation of NEMO. Consequently, polyubiquitylated NEMO undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation, which perturbs NF-kappaB activation. As NEMO is essential for NF-kappaB activation, we propose that the polyubiquitylation and degradation of NEMO during Shigella infection is a new bacterial strategy to modulate host inflammatory responses."
17360709,Interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase with cellular nuclear import receptor importin 7 and its impact on viral replication.,"Similar to all other viruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) depends heavily on cellular factors for its successful replication. In this study we have investigated the interaction of HIV-1 integrase (IN) with several host nuclear import factors using co-immunoprecipitation assays. Our results indicate that IN interacts specifically with host importin 7 (Imp7) in vivo, but does not interact with importin 8 (Imp8) or importin alpha (Rch1). In contrast, another HIV-1 karyophilic protein MAp17, which is capable of binding Rch1, fails to interact with Imp7, suggesting that IN and Map17 may interact with different cellular pathways during HIV-1 replication. Genetic analysis revealed that the C-terminal domain of IN is the region responsible for interaction between IN with Imp7, and an IN mutant (K240A,K244A/R263A,K264A) disrupted the Imp7 binding ability of the protein, indicating that both regions ((235)WKGPAKLLWKG and (262)RRKAK) within the C-terminal domain of IN are required for efficient IN/Imp7 interaction. Using a vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein pseudotyped HIV single-cycle replication system, we showed that the IN/Imp7 interaction-deficient mutant was unable to mediate viral replication and displayed impairment at both viral reverse transcription and nuclear import steps. Moreover, transient knockdown of Imp7 in both HIV-1 producing and target cells resulted in a 2.5-3.5-fold inhibition of HIV infection. Altogether, our results indicate that HIV-1 IN specifically interacts with Imp7, and this viral/cellular protein interaction contributes to efficient HIV-1 infection."
12676986,Hyaluronidase 2 negatively regulates RON receptor tyrosine kinase and mediates transformation of epithelial cells by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus.,"The candidate tumor-suppressor gene hyaluronidase 2 (HYAL2) encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface protein that serves as an entry receptor for jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus, a virus that causes contagious lung cancer in sheep that is morphologically similar to human bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. The viral envelope (Env) protein alone can transform cultured cells, and we hypothesized that Env could bind and sequester the HYAL2 receptor and thus liberate a potential oncogenic factor bound and negatively controlled by HYAL2. Here we show that the HYAL2 receptor protein is associated with the RON receptor tyrosine kinase (also called MST1R or Stk in the mouse), rendering it functionally silent. In human cells expressing a jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus Env transgene, the Env protein physically associates with HYAL2. RON liberated from the association with HYAL2 becomes functionally active and consequently activates the Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways leading to oncogenic transformation of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells. We find activated RON in a subset of human bronchioloalveolar carcinoma tumors, suggesting RON involvement in this type of human lung cancer."
16191204,Amino acid residues that are important for Hyal2 function as a receptor for jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus.,"Infection by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and by enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV) depends on cell-surface expression of the virus entry receptor, hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2). Human Hyal2 binds the envelope (Env) proteins of these viruses and is functional as a receptor, but Hyal2 from mice does not bind Env nor does it mediate entry of either virus. Here we have explored the amino acid determinants that account for the difference in receptor function."
9847399,Binding specificity of protein phosphatase 2A core enzyme for regulatory B subunits and T antigens.,"The core enzyme of protein phosphatase 2A is composed of a regulatory subunit A and a catalytic subunit C. It is controlled by three types of regulatory B subunits (B, B', and B"") and by tumor (T) antigens, which are unrelated by sequence but bind to overlapping regions on the A subunit. To find out whether the different B subunits and T antigens bind to identical or distinct amino acids of the A subunit, mutants were generated and their abilities to bind B subunits and T antigens were tested. We found that some amino acids are involved in the binding of all types of B subunits, whereas others are specifically involved in the binding of one or two types of B subunits. T-antigen-binding specificity does not correlate with that of a particular type of B subunit."
21139582,"The HPV16 E6 binding protein Tip-1 interacts with ARHGEF16, which activates Cdc42.","Guanidine exchange factor (GEF)-catalysed activation of Rho proteins such as Cdc42 has been shown to have a crucial role in cellular transformation, malignant progression and invasion. We have previously shown that the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein binds to the PDZ domain protein Tax-interacting-protein 1 (Tip-1) and we now report identification and functional analysis of a novel Tip-1 binding GEF."
22904195,HIV-1 matrix protein p17 promotes angiogenesis via chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2.,"Vascular diseases supported by aberrant angiogenesis have increased incidence in HIV-1-infected patients. Several data suggest that endothelium dysfunction relies on action of HIV-1 proteins rather than on a direct effect of the virus itself. The HIV-1 matrix protein p17 is known to deregulate the biological activity of different immune cells. Recently, p17 was found to mimic IL-8 chemokine activity by binding to the IL-8 receptor CXCR1. Here we show that p17 binds with high affinity to CXCR2, a CXCR1-related receptor, and promotes the formation of capillary-like structures on human endothelial cells (ECs) by interacting with both CXCR1 and CXCR2 expressed on the EC surface. ERK signaling via Akt was defined as the pathway responsible for p17-induced tube formation. Ex vivo and in vivo experimental models confirmed the provasculogenic activity of p17, which was comparable to that induced by VEGF-A. The hypothesis of a major role for p17 in HIV-1-induced aberrant angiogenesis is enforced by the finding that p17 is detected, as a single protein, in blood vessels of HIV-1-patients and in particular in the nucleus of ECs. Localization of p17 in the nucleus of ECs was evidenced also in in vitro experiments, suggesting the internalization of exogenous p17 in ECs by mechanisms of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recognizing p17 interaction with CXCR1 and CXCR2 as the key event in sustaining EC aberrant angiogenesis could help us to identify new treatment strategies in combating AIDS-related vascular diseases."
7491787,The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein: a potential regulator of proteolysis and protein transport in the mammalian secretory pathway.,"HIV-1 Vpu is a small transmembrane phosphoprotein of 16 kDa which performs critical roles in CD4 proteolysis and virus release. Previous studies have demonstrated that Vpu-induced degradation of CD4 occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and that the proteolytic process is sequence specific requiring both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CD4. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Vpu expression on the intracellular membrane trafficking pathway of mammalian cells. In singly transfected cells, the HIV envelope glycoproteins and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) were properly transported to the cell surface undergoing oligosaccharide modifications characteristic of their movement through the Golgi complex. In contrast, the cell surface delivery of glycoproteins was severely impeded in cells expressing Vpu. Biochemical analyses revealed that Vpu expression blocked the transfer of proteins from the ER-Golgi complex to the plasma membrane in a dose- and protein-dependent manner. Soluble gp120 exhibited extreme transport defects in the presence of Vpu, whereas transmembrane proteins (e.g., gp160, VSV) responded only moderately to wild-type Vpu. To gain insight into Vpu-mediated transport inhibition, we performed mutational analysis of the CK-2 phosphorylation sites (serines at 52 and 56) in the Vpu protein. CK-2 phosphorylation of Vpu has been shown to regulate the activity of the protein in reactions that involve the proteolysis of CD4 in the ER. We demonstrate here that the phosphorylation mutant is defective in both sequence-specific degradation of VRE-containing substrates and the transport inhibition of gp120 and VSV-G in the secretory pathway. Thus, these experiments have revealed that Vpu-mediated proteolysis and transport inhibition are mechanistically coupled requiring the same structural elements of the Vpu protein in both processes. We propose that the primary effect of Vpu expression is to impede the secretion process and then access glycoproteins bearing the VRE for Vpu-mediated proteolysis in the ER of mammalian cells."
9847311,Vpu increases susceptibility of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected cells to fas killing.,"The importance of the Fas death pathway in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been the subject of many studies. Missing from these studies is direct measurement of infected cell susceptibility to Fas-induced death. To address this question, we investigated whether T cells infected with HIV are more susceptible to Fas-induced death. We found that Fas cross-linking caused a decrease in the number of HIV-infected Jurkat T cells and CD4(+) peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). We confirmed this finding by demonstrating that there were more apoptotic infected than uninfected cells after Fas ligation. The increase in sensitivity of HIV-infected cells to Fas killing mapped to vpu, while nef, vif, vpr, and second exon of tat did not appear to contribute. Furthermore, expression of Vpu in Jurkat T cells rendered them more susceptible to Fas-induced death. These results show that HIV-infected cells are more sensitive to Fas-induced death and that the Vpu protein of HIV contributes to this sensitivity. The increased sensitivity of HIV-infected cells to Fas-induced death might help explain why these cells have such a short in vivo half-life."
9104816,The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu protein interferes with an early step in the biosynthesis of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vpu gene encodes a small integral membrane phosphoprotein with two established functions: degradation of the viral coreceptor CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and augmentation of virus particle release from the plasma membrane of HIV-1-infected cells. We show here that Vpu is also largely responsible for the previously observed decrease in the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of HIV-1-infected cells. Cells infected with HIV-1 isolates that fail to express Vpu, or that express genetically modified forms of Vpu that no longer induce CD4 degradation, exhibit little downregulation of MHC class I molecules. The effect of Vpu on class I biogenesis was analyzed in more detail using a Vpu-expressing recombinant vaccinia virus (VV). VV-expressed Vpu induces the rapid loss of newly synthesized endogenous or VV-expressed class I heavy chains in the ER, detectable either biochemically or by reduced cell surface expression. This effect is of similar rapidity and magnitude as the VV-expressed Vpu-induced degradation of CD4. Vpu had no discernible effects on cell surface expression of VV-expressed mouse CD54, demonstrating the selectivity of its effects on CD4 and class I heavy chains. VV-expressed Vpu does not detectably affect class I molecules that have been exported from the ER. The detrimental effects of Vpu on class I molecules could be distinguished from those caused by VV-expressed herpes virus protein ICP47, which acts by decreasing the supply of cytosolic peptides to class I molecules, indicating that Vpu functions in a distinct manner from ICP47. Based on these findings, we propose that Vpu-induced downregulation of class I molecules may be an important factor in the evolutionary selection of the HIV-1-specific vpu gene by contributing to the inability of CD8+ T cells to eradicate HIV-1 from infected individuals."
9275210,HIV-1 infection of nondividing cells through the recognition of integrase by the importin/karyopherin pathway.,"The karyophilic properties of the HIV-1 nucleoprotein complex facilitate infection of nondividing cells such as macrophages and quiescent T lymphocytes, and allow the in vivo delivery of transgenes by HIV-derived retroviral vectors into terminally differentiated cells such as neurons. Although the viral matrix (MA) and Vpr proteins have previously been shown to play important roles in this process, we demonstrate here that integrase, the enzyme responsible for mediating the integration of the viral genome in the host cell chromosome, can suffice to connect the HIV-1 preintegration complex with the cell nuclear import machinery. This novel function of integrase reflects the recognition of an atypical bipartite nuclear localization signal by the importin/karyopherin pathway."
8551560,Role of the karyopherin pathway in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nuclear import.,"The interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nucleoprotein complex with the cell nuclear import machinery is necessary for viral replication in macrophages and for the establishment of infection in quiescent T lymphocytes. The karyophilic properties of two viral proteins, matrix (MA) and Vpr, are keys to this process. Here, we show that an early step of HIV-1 nuclear import is the recognition of the MA nuclear localization signal (NLS) by Rch1, a member of the karyopherin-alpha family. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an N-terminally truncated form of Rch1 which binds MA but fails to localize to the nucleus efficiently blocks MA- but not Vpr-mediated HIV-1 nuclear import. Correspondingly, NLS peptide inhibits the nuclear migration of MA but not that of Vpr and prevents the infection of terminally differentiated macrophages by vpr-defective virus but not wild-type virus. These results are consistent with a model in which Rch1 or another member of the karyopherin-alpha family, through the recognition of the MA NLS, participates in docking the HIV-1 nucleoprotein complex at the nuclear pore. In addition, our data suggest that Vpr governs HIV-1 nuclear import through a distinct pathway."
10860744,Two nuclear localization signals in the HIV-1 matrix protein regulate nuclear import of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex.,"Replication of HIV-1 in non-dividing and slowly proliferating cell populations depends on active import of the viral pre-integration complex (PIC) into the cell nucleus. While it is commonly accepted that this process is mediated by an interaction between the HIV-1 PIC and the cellular nuclear import machinery, controversial results have been reported concerning the mechanisms of this interaction. Here, we demonstrate that a recently identified nuclear localization signal within the HIV-1 matrix protein (MA), MA NLS-2, together with previously described MA NLS-1, mediates nuclear import of the HIV-1 PIC. Inactivation of both MA NLSs precluded nuclear translocation of MA and rendered the virus defective in nuclear import and replication in non-dividing macrophage cultures, even when functional Vpr and integrase (IN), two more viral proteins implicated in HIV-1 nuclear import, were present. Taken together, these results indicate that Vpr does not function as an independent nuclear import factor and demonstrate that HIV-1 MA, by virtue of its two nuclear localization signals, regulates HIV-1 nuclear import."
8938574,Induction of inflammatory cytokines in placental monocytes of gravidae infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"Placental mononuclear cells (PMC) are susceptible to infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). PMC secreted tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta), and IL-6 among other factors, which, in turn, regulate HIV replication in latently infected cells. We assessed the induction of these cytokines in PMC from HIV-infected (HIV+) and uninfected (control) gravidae following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), HIV lysate (iHIV), recombinant HIV env (GP160) and HIV gag (gag55), and synthetic HIV p17 (HGP30) antigens. In comparison to control PMC, HIV+ PMC constitutively secreted higher levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 and were refractory to stimulation by iHIV, GP160, gag55, and HGP30. Control PMC IL-1 beta levels were boosted by LPS; gag55 and HGP30 augmented IL-6 but not IL-1 beta. Both groups exhibited low basal TNF-alpha production that was augmented by LPS. HIV+ PMC exhibited higher constitutive levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha gene transcription than control PMC. These levels could be further augmented by LPS, yet the incremental levels were lower than those obtained from PMC of uninfected women. The high basal constitutive secretion of cytokines by HIV+ PMC and their refractoriness to activation may reflect a virus-mediated dysregulation of cytokine expression culminating in compromised host defenses against secondary opportunistic infections associated with AIDS."
15302882,Interplay between HIV-1 Vpr and Sp1 modulates p21(WAF1) gene expression in human astrocytes.,"The Vpr (viral protein R) of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, which is expressed during the late stage of the viral infection, has received special attention because of its ability to control transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, long terminal repeat and to influence cell cycle progression. Here we demonstrate that Vpr has the ability to regulate transcription of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(WAF1) (p21), one of the key regulators of the cell cycle, in human astrocytic cells. The results from transcription assays demonstrated that Vpr augments promoter activity of p21 through the GC-rich region located between nucleotides -84 and -74 with respect to the +1 transcription start site. Activation of p21 by Vpr required cooperativity of Sp1, which binds to the DNA sequence spanning -84 to -74. Results from bandshift assay revealed an increased level of Sp1 DNA binding activity in the presence of Vpr. Furthermore, Vpr was able to associate with Sp1 via the zinc finger domain located in the C-terminal region of Sp1. Functional studies revealed that the cooperativity between Vpr and Sp1 requires the zinc finger domain at the C terminus and the glutamine-rich domain at the N terminus of Sp1. Expression of p53 further enhanced the level of Vpr-Sp1-mediated transcription activation of p21 through the sequence spanning -84 to -74 and increased the DNA binding activity of Sp1 in the presence of Vpr. Results from glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay showed the association of Vpr with p53 in extracts containing Sp1. Altogether, the outcome of our functional and binding studies suggested that the physical interaction of Vpr with Sp1 and p53 could modulate transcriptional activity of p21."
9185604,Phosphorylation of both phosphoacceptor sites in the HIV-1 Vpu cytoplasmic domain is essential for Vpu-mediated ER degradation of CD4.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu is phosphorylated at two serine residues (Ser52 and Ser56) present within the acidic dodecapeptide region of the 54-aa cytoplasmic domain. Previous experiments have shown that Vpu phosphorylation is critical for the degradation of CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this study, we carried out experiments to elucidate the role of individual phosphoacceptor sites in CD4 proteolysis. We show here that acidic amino acids could not functionally substitute for phosphoserines in Vpu that is capable of inducing the degradation of CD4. Our studies have further revealed that phosphorylation of either of the two phosphoacceptor sites is not sufficient to generate a functional Vpu protein. When tested for functional complementation, inactive phosphorylation-proficient Vpu mutants failed to generate Vpu proteins that had the ability to induce the degradation of Vpu-sensitive glycoproteins. The failure to complement was not due to assembly defects in the Vpu protein as unphosphorylated Vpu formed oligomeric complexes in the cell. We also showed that Vpu expression inhibits protein transport in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Our studies have thus revealed that both phosphoserines in Vpu are critical participants in a pathway that leads to the proteolysis of CD4 in the ER and that these phosphoserines should be present on the same subunit of the Vpu protein."
15905402,The intracellular fate of Salmonella depends on the recruitment of kinesin.,"Salmonella enterica causes a variety of diseases, including gastroenteritis and typhoid fever. The success of this pathogen depends on its capacity to proliferate within host cells in a membrane-bound compartment. We found that the Salmonella-containing vacuole recruited the plus-end-directed motor kinesin. Bacterial effector proteins translocated into the host cell by a type III secretion system antagonistically regulated this event. Among these effectors, SifA targeted SKIP, a host protein that down-regulated the recruitment of kinesin on the bacterial vacuole and, in turn, controlled vacuolar membrane dynamics."
9621063,Interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr protein with the nuclear pore complex.,"The Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) performs a number of functions that are associated with the nucleus. Vpr enhances the nuclear import of postentry viral nucleoprotein complexes, arrests proliferating cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and acts as a modest transcriptional activator. For this paper, we have investigated the nuclear import of Vpr. Although Vpr does not encode a sequence that is recognizable as a nuclear localization signal (NLS), Vpr functions as a transferable NLS both in somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In certain contexts, Vpr also mediates substantial accumulation at the nuclear envelope and, in particular, at nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Consistent with this, Vpr is shown to interact specifically with nucleoporin phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat regions. These findings not only demonstrate that Vpr harbors a bona fide NLS but also raise the possibility that one (or more) of Vpr's functions may take place at the NPC."
25275135,Determinants of efficient degradation of APOBEC3 restriction factors by HIV-1 Vif.,"The APOBEC3 deoxycytidine deaminases can restrict the replication of HIV-1 in cell culture to differing degrees. The effects of APOBEC3 enzymes are largely suppressed by HIV-1 Vif that interacts with host proteins to form a Cullin5-Ring E3 ubiquitin ligase that induces (48)K-linked polyubiquitination (poly-Ub) and proteasomal degradation of APOBEC3 enzymes. Vif variants have differing abilities to induce degradation of APOBEC3 enzymes and the underlying biochemical mechanisms for these differences is not fully understood. We hypothesized that by characterizing the interaction of multiple APOBEC3 enzymes and Vif variants we could identify common features that resulted in Vif-mediated degradation and further define the determinants required for efficient Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3 enzymes. We used Vifs from HIV-1 NL4-3 (IIIB) and HXB2 to characterize their induced degradation of and interaction with APOBEC3G, APOBEC3G D128K, APOBEC3H, and APOBEC3B in 293T cells. We quantified the APOBEC3G-Vif and APOBEC3H-Vif interaction strengths in vitro using rotational anisotropy. Our biochemical and cellular analyses of the interactions support a model in which the degradation efficiency of VifIIIB and VifHXB2 correlated with both the binding strength of the APOBEC3-Vif interaction and the APOBEC3-Vif interface, which differs for APOBEC3G and APOBEC3H. Notably, Vif bound to APOBEC3H and APOBEC3B in the natural absence of Vif-induced degradation and the interaction resulted in (63)K-linked poly-Ub of APOBEC3H and APOBEC3B, demonstrating additional functionality of the APOBEC3-Vif interaction apart from induction of proteasomal degradation."
26105074,The HDAC6/APOBEC3G complex regulates HIV-1 infectiveness by inducing Vif autophagic degradation.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has evolved a complex strategy to overcome the immune barriers it encounters throughout an organism thanks to its viral infectivity factor (Vif), a key protein for HIV-1 infectivity and in vivo pathogenesis. Vif interacts with and promotes ""apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G"" (A3G) ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, thus eluding A3G restriction activity against HIV-1."
22301138,Herpes simplex virus 1 tegument protein US11 downmodulates the RLR signaling pathway via direct interaction with RIG-I and MDA-5.,"The interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral response is a major defense of the host immune system. In order to complete their life cycle, viruses must modulate host IFN-mediated immune responses. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a large DNA virus containing more than 80 genes, many of which encode proteins that are involved in virus-host interactions and show immune modulatory capabilities. In this study, we demonstrate that the US11 protein, an RNA binding tegument protein of HSV-1, is a novel antagonist of the beta IFN (IFN-β) pathway. US11 significantly inhibited Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-β production, and its double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain was indispensable for this inhibition activity. Additionally, wild-type HSV-1 coinfection showed stronger inhibition than US11 mutant HSV-1 in SeV-induced IFN-β production. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the US11 protein in HSV-1-infected cells interacts with endogenous RIG-I and MDA-5 through its C-terminal RNA-binding domain, which was RNA independent. Expression of US11 in both transfected and HSV-1-infected cells interferes with the interaction between MAVS and RIG-I or MDA-5. Finally, US11 dampens SeV-mediated IRF3 activation. Taken together, the combined data indicate that HSV-1 US11 binds to RIG-I and MDA-5 and inhibits their downstream signaling pathway, preventing the production of IFN-β, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HSV-1 infection."
21880768,Human cytomegalovirus infection causes degradation of Sp100 proteins that suppress viral gene expression.,"The interferon-inducible Sp100 proteins are thought to play roles in the chromatin pathway and in transcriptional regulation. Sp100A, the smallest isoform, is one of the major components of PML nuclear bodies (NBs) that exhibit intrinsic antiviral activity against several viruses. Since PML NBs are disrupted by the immediate-early 1 (IE1) protein during human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, the modulation of Sp100 protein expression or activity during infection has been suggested. Here, we show that Sp100 proteins are lost largely in the late stages of HCMV infection. This event required viral gene expression and involved posttranscriptional control. The mutant virus with deletion of the sequence for IE1 (CR208) did not have Sp100 loss. In CR208 infection, PML depletion by RNA interference abrogated the accumulation of SUMO-modified Sp100A and of certain high-molecular-weight Sp100 isoforms but did not significantly affect unmodified Sp100A, suggesting that the IE1-induced disruption of PML NBs is not sufficient for the complete loss of Sp100 proteins. Sp100A loss was found to require proteasome activity. Depletion of all Sp100 proteins by RNA silencing enhanced HCMV replication and major IE (MIE) gene expression. Sp100 knockdown enhanced the acetylation level of histones associated with the MIE promoter, demonstrating that the repressive effect of Sp100 proteins may involve, at least in part, the epigenetic control of the MIE promoter. Sp100A was found to interact directly with IE1 through the N-terminal dimerization domain. These findings indicate that the IE1-dependent loss of Sp100 proteins during HCMV infection may represent an important requirement for efficient viral growth."
24696485,Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 encoding open reading frame 11 targets TANK binding kinase 1 to negatively regulate the host type I interferon response.,"Upon viral infection, type I interferons, such as alpha and beta interferon (IFN-α and IFN-β, respectively), are rapidly induced and activate multiple antiviral genes, thereby serving as the first line of host defense. Many DNA and RNA viruses counteract the host interferon system by modulating the production of IFNs. In this study, we report that murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68), a double-stranded DNA virus, encodes open reading frame 11 (ORF11), a novel immune modulator, to block IFN-β production. ORF11-deficient recombinant viruses induced more IFN-β production in fibroblast and macrophage cells than the MHV-68 wild type or a marker rescue virus. MHV-68 ORF11 decreased IFN-β promoter activation by various factors, the signaling of which converges on TBK1-IRF3 activation. MHV-68 ORF11 directly interacted with both overexpressed and endogenous TBK1 but not with IRF3. Physical interactions between ORF11 and endogenous TBK1 were further confirmed during virus replication in fibroblasts using a recombinant virus expressing FLAG-ORF11. ORF11 efficiently reduced interaction between TBK1 and IRF3 and subsequently inhibited activation of IRF3, thereby negatively regulating IFN-β production. Our domain-mapping study showed that the central domain of ORF11 was responsible for both TBK1 binding and inhibition of IFN-β induction, while the kinase domain of TBK1 was sufficient for ORF11 binding. Taken together, these results suggest a mechanism underlying inhibition of IFN-β production by a gammaherpesvirus and highlight the importance of TBK1 in DNA virus replication."
22776252,NF-κB signalling is attenuated by the E7 protein from cutaneous human papillomaviruses.,"The high-risk Alpha-types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the causative agent of cervical cancer, which is the second major cause of death among women worldwide. Recent investigations have shown that E7 from the Alpha-papillomavirus HPV-16 interacts with IKKα and IKKβ of the IKK complex in the NF-κB pathway leading to an attenuation of the activity. There is a possible link between development of non-melanoma skin cancer and cutaneous Beta-papillomavirus but if these HPV types attenuate the NF-κB pathway is unclear. Seven different E7 proteins, representing four out of the five different species of the Beta genus (HPV-20, -37, -38, -92, -93 and -96) and one from the Gamma genus (HPV-4) were investigated for potential modulation of the NF-κB pathway in U2OS cells. Our results demonstrate that E7 from all the cutaneous HPV types were capable of inhibiting the NF-κB activity as well as E7 from HPV-16. In addition, E7 proteins from the cutaneous HPV types demonstrated interaction with IKKα but not with IKKβ. The deregulation of the NF-κB pathway by cutaneous HPVs might contribute to the pathogenesis of non-melanoma skin cancers and its precursors."
20679221,Trimethylguanosine capping selectively promotes expression of Rev-dependent HIV-1 RNAs.,"5'-mRNA capping is an early modification that affects pre-mRNA synthesis/splicing, RNA cytoplasmic transport, and mRNA translation and turnover. In eukaryotes, a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap is added to newly transcribed RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcripts. A subset of RNAP II-transcribed cellular RNAs, including small nuclear RNA (snRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), and telomerase RNA, is further hypermethylated at the exocyclic N2 of the guanosine to create a trimethylguanosine (TMG)-capped RNA. Some of these TMG-capped RNAs are transported within the nucleus and from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the CRM-1 (required for chromosome region maintenance) protein. CRM-1 is also used to export Rev/RRE-dependent unspliced/ partially spliced HIV-1 RNAs. Here we report that like snRNAs and snoRNAs, some Rev/RRE-dependent HIV-1 RNAs are TMG-capped. The methyltransferase responsible for TMG modification of HIV-1 RNAs is the human PIMT (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-interacting protein with methyltransferase) protein. TMG capping of unspliced/partially spliced HIV-1 RNAs represents a new regulatory mechanism for selective expression."
20554775,Importin alpha3 interacts with HIV-1 integrase and contributes to HIV-1 nuclear import and replication.,"HIV-1 employs the cellular nuclear import machinery to actively transport its preintegration complex (PIC) into the nucleus for integration of the viral DNA. Several viral karyophilic proteins and cellular import factors have been suggested to contribute to HIV-1 PIC nuclear import and replication. However, how HIV interacts with different cellular machineries to ensure efficient nuclear import of its preintegration complex in dividing and nondividing cells is still not fully understood. In this study, we have investigated different importin alpha (Impalpha) family members for their impacts on HIV-1 replication, and we demonstrate that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated Impalpha3 knockdown (KD) significantly impaired HIV infection in HeLa cells, CD4(+) C8166 T cells, and primary macrophages. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that Impalpha3-KD resulted in significantly reduced levels of viral 2-long-terminal repeat (2-LTR) circles but had no effect on HIV reverse transcription. All of these data indicate an important role for Impalpha3 in HIV nuclear import. In an attempt to understand how Impalpha3 participates in HIV nuclear import and replication, we first demonstrated that the HIV-1 karyophilic protein integrase (IN) was able to interact with Impalpha3 both in a 293T cell expression system and in HIV-infected CD4(+) C8166 T cells. Deletion analysis suggested that a region (amino acids [aa] 250 to 270) in the C-terminal domain of IN is involved in this viral-cellular protein interaction. Overall, this study demonstrates for the first time that Impalpha3 is an HIV integrase-interacting cofactor that is required for efficient HIV-1 nuclear import and replication in both dividing and nondividing cells."
18498651,The host protein Staufen1 interacts with the Pr55Gag zinc fingers and regulates HIV-1 assembly via its N-terminus.,"The formation of new infectious human immunodeficiency type 1 virus (HIV-1) mainly relies on the homo-multimerization of the viral structural polyprotein Pr55Gag and on the recruitment of host factors. We have previously shown that the double-stranded RNA-binding protein Staufen 1 (Stau1), likely through an interaction between its third double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD3) and the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Pr55Gag, participates in HIV-1 assembly by influencing Pr55Gag multimerization."
22978549,ESCRT-II's involvement in HIV-1 genomic RNA trafficking and assembly.,"Several host proteins play crucial roles in the HIV-1 replication cycle. The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) exemplifies a large, multi-component host machinery that is required by HIV-1 for viral budding. ESCRT promotes the inward budding of vesicles from the membranes of late endosomes to generate multi-vesicular bodies. However, HIV-1 co-opts the ESCRT to enable outwards budding of virus particles from the plasma membrane, a phenomenon that is topologically similar to multi-vesicular body biogenesis. A role for ESCRTII in mRNA trafficking has been established in Drosophila in which the ESCRT-II components, Vps22 and Vps36, promote the localisation of the bicoid mRNA in the fertilised egg. This is achieved via specific interactions with the Staufen protein. In this work, we investigated a possible implication of ESCRT-II in the HIV-1 replication cycle."
24240280,Structural basis for recognition of synaptic vesicle protein 2C by botulinum neurotoxin A.,"Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) belongs to the most dangerous class of bioweapons. Despite this, BoNT/A is used to treat a wide range of common medical conditions such as migraines and a variety of ocular motility and movement disorders. BoNT/A is probably best known for its use as an antiwrinkle agent in cosmetic applications (including Botox and Dysport). BoNT/A application causes long-lasting flaccid paralysis of muscles through inhibiting the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine by cleaving synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) within presynaptic nerve terminals. Two types of BoNT/A receptor have been identified, both of which are required for BoNT/A toxicity and are therefore likely to cooperate with each other: gangliosides and members of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2) family, which are putative transporter proteins that are predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains, associate with the receptor-binding domain of the toxin. Recently, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) has also been reported to be a potential BoNT/A receptor. In SV2 proteins, the BoNT/A-binding site has been mapped to the luminal domain, but the molecular details of the interaction between BoNT/A and SV2 are unknown. Here we determined the high-resolution crystal structure of the BoNT/A receptor-binding domain (BoNT/A-RBD) in complex with the SV2C luminal domain (SV2C-LD). SV2C-LD consists of a right-handed, quadrilateral β-helix that associates with BoNT/A-RBD mainly through backbone-to-backbone interactions at open β-strand edges, in a manner that resembles the inter-strand interactions in amyloid structures. Competition experiments identified a peptide that inhibits the formation of the complex. Our findings provide a strong platform for the development of novel antitoxin agents and for the rational design of BoNT/A variants with improved therapeutic properties."
12072504,"Translational regulation of human papillomavirus type 16 E7 mRNA by the peptide SEQIKA, shared by rabbit alpha(1)-globin and human cytokeratin 7.","The possible biochemical factors able to affect the in vitro expression of the high-risk human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E7 oncoprotein have been analyzed. Evidence is provided that E7 mRNA stability is increased and, conversely, transcript translation is inhibited by binding to a 32-kDa protein from rabbit reticulocyte lysate; sequence analysis identified the 32-kDa binding protein as rabbit alpha(1)-globin protein; and interaction between rabbit alpha(1)-globin and E7 mRNA occurs through the 6-mer peptide SEQIKA present in human cytokeratin 7 protein. The in vitro data were confirmed by the occurrence of HPV16 E7 mRNA-cytokeratin 7 binding in squamous cervical cancer SiHa cells."
7831289,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef and p56lck protein-tyrosine kinase interact with a common element in CD4 cytoplasmic tail.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nef gene induces endocytosis of CD4 antigen and disrupts the association between CD4 and p56lck protein-tyrosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.112). We demonstrate that in T cells these effects of the viral protein require a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids in a membrane-proximal region of the CD4 cytoplasmic tail; other amino acids in the C-terminal segment of CD4 cytoplasmic tail also contribute to the interaction. Mutations in CD4 that prevent down-modulation by Nef also decrease CD4 association with p56lck and prevent Nef-induced disruption of CD4-p56lck complexes. Together, the overlap in CD4 sequences required for interaction with Nef and p56lck and the tight correlation between Nef-induced CD4 down-modulation and disruption of CD4-p56lck association suggest that Nef, or cellular factors recruited by Nef, interact with this segment of CD4 to displace p56lck from the complex and induce CD4 endocytosis."
11285224,Mechanism for down-regulation of CD28 by Nef.,"SIV and HIV Nef proteins disrupt T-cell receptor machinery by down-modulating cell surface expression of CD4 and expression or signaling of CD3-TCR. Nef also down-modulates class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) surface expression. We show that SIV and HIV-1 Nefs down-modulate CD28, a major co-stimulatory receptor that mediates effective T-cell activation, by accelerating CD28 endocytosis. The effects of Nef on CD28, CD4, CD3 and class I MHC expression are all genetically separable, indicating that all are selected independently. In cells expressing a Nef-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion, CD28 co-localizes with the AP-2 clathrin adaptor and Nef-GFP. Mutations that disrupt Nef interaction with AP-2 disrupt CD28 down-regulation. Furthermore, HIV and SIV Nefs use overlapping but distinct target sites in the membrane-proximal region of the CD28 cytoplasmic domain. Thus, Nef probably induces CD28 endocytosis via the AP-2 pathway, and this involves a ternary complex containing Nef, AP-2 and CD28. The likely consequence of the concerted down-regulation of CD28, CD4 and/or CD3 by Nef is disruption of antigen-specific signaling machineries in infected T cells following a productive antigen recognition event."
18158319,Regulation of cellular zinc balance as a potential mechanism of EVER-mediated protection against pathogenesis by cutaneous oncogenic human papillomaviruses.,"Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a genodermatosis associated with skin cancers that results from a selective susceptibility to related human papillomaviruses (EV HPV). Invalidating mutations in either of two genes (EVER1 and EVER2) with unknown functions cause most EV cases. We report that EVER1 and EVER2 proteins form a complex and interact with the zinc transporter 1 (ZnT-1), as shown by yeast two-hybrid screening, GST pull-down, and immunoprecipitation experiments. In keratinocytes, EVER and ZnT-1 proteins do not influence intracellular zinc concentration, but do affect intracellular zinc distribution. EVER2 was found to inhibit free zinc influx to nucleoli. Keratinocytes with a mutated EVER2 grew faster than wild-type keratinocytes. In transiently and stably transfected HaCaT cells, EVER and ZnT-1 down-regulated transcription factors stimulated by zinc (MTF-1) or cytokines (c-Jun and Elk), as detected with luciferase assays. To get some insight into the control of EV HPV infection, we searched for interaction between EVER and ZnT-1 and oncoproteins of cutaneous (HPV5) and genital (HPV16) genotypes. HPV16 E5 protein binds to EVER and ZnT-1 and blocks their negative regulation. The lack of a functional E5 protein encoded by EV HPV genome may account for host restriction of these viruses."
12458223,Functional role of HIV-1 virion-associated uracil DNA glycosylase 2 in the correction of G:U mispairs to G:C pairs.,"Human monocytes/macrophages are target cells for HIV-1 infection. As other non-dividing cells, they are characterized by low and imbalanced intracellular dNTP pool levels and an excess of dUTP. The replication of HIV-1 in this cellular context favors misincorporation of uracil residues into viral DNA because of the use of dUTP in place of dCTP. We have previously reported that the host uracil DNA glycosylase enzyme UNG2 is packaged into HIV-1 viral particles via a specific association with the integrase domain of the Gag-Pol precursor. In this study, we investigated whether virion-associated UNG2 plays a role similar to that of its cellular counterpart. We show that the L172A mutation of integrase impaired the packaging of UNG2 into viral particles. Using a primer-template DNA substrate containing G:U mispairs, we demonstrate that wild-type viral lysate has the ability to repair G:U mismatched pairs to G:C matched pairs, in contrast to UNG2-deficient viral lysate. Moreover, no correction of G:T mispairs by wild-type HIV-1 viral lysate was observed, which argues for the specificity of the repair process. We also show that UNG2 physically associates with the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme. Altogether our data indicate for the first time that a uracil repair pathway is specifically associated with HIV-1 viral particles. However, the molecular mechanism of this process remains to be characterized further."
23300442,Inhibition of a NEDD8 Cascade Restores Restriction of HIV by APOBEC3G.,"Cellular restriction factors help to defend humans against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV accessory proteins hijack at least three different Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, which must be activated by the small ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8, in order to counteract host cellular restriction factors. We found that conjugation of NEDD8 to Cullin-5 by the NEDD8-conjugating enzyme UBE2F is required for HIV Vif-mediated degradation of the host restriction factor APOBEC3G (A3G). Pharmacological inhibition of the NEDD8 E1 by MLN4924 or knockdown of either UBE2F or its RING-protein binding partner RBX2 bypasses the effect of Vif, restoring the restriction of HIV by A3G. NMR mapping and mutational analyses define specificity determinants of the UBE2F NEDD8 cascade. These studies demonstrate that disrupting host NEDD8 cascades presents a novel antiretroviral therapeutic approach enhancing the ability of the immune system to combat HIV."
23333304,CBFβ stabilizes HIV Vif to counteract APOBEC3 at the expense of RUNX1 target gene expression.,"The HIV-1 accessory protein Vif hijacks a cellular Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase, CRL5, to promote degradation of the APOBEC3 (A3) family of restriction factors. Recently, the cellular transcription cofactor CBFβ was shown to form a complex with CRL5-Vif and to be essential for A3 degradation and viral infectivity. We now demonstrate that CBFβ is required for assembling a well-ordered CRL5-Vif complex by inhibiting Vif oligomerization and by activating CRL5-Vif via direct interaction. The CRL5-Vif-CBFβ holoenzyme forms a well-defined heterohexamer, indicating that Vif simultaneously hijacks CRL5 and CBFβ. Heterodimers of CBFβ and RUNX transcription factors contribute toward the regulation of genes, including those with immune system functions. We show that binding of Vif to CBFβ is mutually exclusive with RUNX heterodimerization and impacts the expression of genes whose regulatory domains are associated with RUNX1. Our results provide a mechanism by which a pathogen with limited coding capacity uses one factor to hijack multiple host pathways."
25912140,Both Rbx1 and Rbx2 exhibit a functional role in the HIV-1 Vif-Cullin5 E3 ligase complex in vitro.,"Rbx1 and Rbx2 are essential components of Cullin-RING E3 Ligases. Vif is generally believed to preferentially recruit the Cul5-Rbx2 module to induce proteasomal degradation of antiretroviral enzyme APOBEC3G, although some investigators have found that the Cul5-Rbx1 module is recruited. Here, to investigate the function of the two Rbx proteins in the Vif-Cul5 complex, we analyzed the performance of Cul5-Rbx1/Cul5-Rbx2 module in the activity of Vif E3 ligase and evaluated the interactions between Rbx1/Rbx2 and Cul5. We found that either Rbx1 or Rbx2 could promote ubiquitination of APOBE3G (A3G) in vitro. We also found that both Rbx1 and Rbx2 could bind Cul5 in cells and Rbx2 could dose-dependently inhibit the interaction of Rbx1 with Cul5. Furthermore, only the decrease of endogenous Rbx2 but not Rbx1 could impair the Vif-induced A3G degradation in cells. These findings indicate that Rbx1 and Rbx2 can both activate Cul5-Vif E3 ligase in vitro, but they may undergo a more delicate selection mechanism in vivo."
18922877,Measles virus V protein is a decoy substrate for IkappaB kinase alpha and prevents Toll-like receptor 7/9-mediated interferon induction.,"The central role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in activating host immune responses stems from their high capacity to express alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) after stimulation of Toll-like receptors 7 and 9 (TLR7 and -9). This involves the adapter MyD88 and the kinases interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), IRAK4, and IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha), which activates IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and is independent of the canonical kinases TBK1 and IKKepsilon. We have recently shown that the immunosuppressive measles virus (MV) abolishes TLR7/9/MyD88-dependent IFN induction in human pDC (Schlender et al., J. Virol. 79:5507-5515, 2005), but the molecular mechanisms remained elusive. Here, we have reconstituted the pathway in cell lines and identified IKKalpha and IRF7 as specific targets of the MV V protein (MV-V). Binding of MV-V to IKKalpha resulted in phosphorylation of V on the expense of IRF7 phosphorylation by IKKalpha in vitro and in living cells. This corroborates the role of IKKalpha as the kinase phosphorylating IRF7. MV-V in addition bound to IRF7 and to phosphomimetic IRF7 and inhibited IRF7 transcriptional activity. Binding to both IKKalpha and IRF7 required the 68-amino-acid unique C-terminal domain of V. Inhibition of TLR/MyD88-dependent IFN induction by MV-V is unique among paramyxovirus V proteins and should contribute to the unique immunosuppressive phenotype of measles. The mechanisms employed by MV-V inspire strategies to interfere with immunopathological TLR/MyD88 signaling."
11333884,Incorporation of lysyl-tRNA synthetase into human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"During human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) assembly, tRNA(Lys) isoacceptors are selectively incorporated into virions and tRNA(Lys)3 is used as the primer for reverse transcription. We show herein that the tRNA(Lys)-binding protein, lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), is also selectively packaged into HIV-1. The viral precursor protein Pr55gag alone will package LysRS into Pr55gag particles, independently of tRNA(Lys). With the additional presence of the viral precursor protein Pr160gag-pol, tRNA(Lys) and LysRS are both packaged into the particle. While the predominant cytoplasmic LysRS has an apparent M(r) of 70,000, viral LysRS associated with tRNA(Lys) packaging is shorter, with an apparent M(r) of 63,000. The truncation occurs independently of viral protease and might be required to facilitate interactions involved in the selective packaging and genomic placement of primer tRNA."
8924209,Cell-free HIV-1Zr6 vif mutants are defective in binding to peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in internalization.,"The vif gene of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is required for productive virus infection of primary blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophages in vitro. Replication of HIV-1 vif- mutants in T-lymphoid cell lines varies and is dependent on the cell line used for virus production. To further understand the role of Vif in HIV-1 infection, we constructed to vif deletion mutants from a molecular clone derived from an African patient (HIV-1Zr6). Cell-free Zr6 vif- virus pools made from transfected rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells do not replicate when added to cultures of stimulated PBMCs. However, vif mutants were able to spread from transfected RD cells to PBMCs if cell-to-cell contact was permitted. By Western blot analysis, viral structural proteins expressed after transfection of RD cells by wild-type or vif mutant proviruses were indistinguishable. However, binding of vif mutants to PBMCs or to purified CD4 and virus internalization were significantly reduced when compared with wild-type virus. The defects in cell-free infection, CD4 binding, and internalization were rescued by transcomplementation using a vif expression plasmid. Our results suggest a novel level at which the HIV-1 vif gene product acts to enhance cell-free infection and indicate that vif plays an important role in promoting HIV-1 binding and internalization. Combined with the previous reports of vif's effect at other steps in infection, this suggests that vif is a pleuripotent gene product that affects multiple stages of the infective process."
11922627,Presence of a helix in human CD4 cytoplasmic domain promotes binding to HIV-1 Nef protein.,"The Nef proteins of simian and human immunodeficiency viruses are known to directly bind and downregulate the CD4 receptor of infected cells. Recent results suggest that residues forming an alpha-helix N-cap in the CD4 cytoplasmic domain play a role in binding of CD4 to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein. We determined the dissociation constants between Nef and several CD4 peptides that contain or do not contain the respective alpha-helix N-cap. Further, we compared helical secondary structure content of these CD4 peptide variants by circular dichroism spectroscopy. We conclude that presence of an alpha-helix in CD4 cytoplasmic domain increases CD4 affinity to Nef. In addition, the amino acid sequence of residues forming the helix N-cap influences CD4 affinity to Nef, too. Finally, the structural changes induced in Nef and CD4 upon binding to each other are investigated."
7853525,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein inhibits activation pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and T-cell lines.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef protein causes the loss of cell surface CD4 and interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (Tac) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD4+ T-cell lines. As both CD4 and the IL-2 receptor play crucial roles in antigen-driven helper T-cell signalling and T-cell proliferation, respectively, the role of Nef in the viral life cycle may be to perturb signalling pathways emanating from these receptors. However, the intracellular targets for Nef that result in receptor down-regulation are unknown. Using a recombinant glutathione S-transferase-full-length 27 kDa Nef (Nef27) fusion protein, produced in Escherichia coli by translation from the first start codon of HIV-1 nef clone pNL4-3, as an affinity reagent to probe cytoplasmic extracts of MT-2 cells and PBMC, we have shown interaction with at least seven host cell protein species ranging from 24 to 75 kDa. Immunoblotting identified four of these proteins as p56lck, CD4, p53, and p44mapk/erk1, all of which are intimately involved in intracellular signalling. To assess the relevance of these interactions and further define the biochemical activity of Nef in signal transduction pathways, highly purified Nef27 protein was introduced directly into PBMC by electroporation. Nef27-treated PBMC showed reduced proliferative responsiveness to exogenous recombinant IL-2. Normally, stimulation of T-cells by IL-2 or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate provokes both augmentation of p56lck activity and corresponding posttranslational modification of p56lck. These changes were also inhibited by treatment of PBMC with Nef, suggesting that Nef interferes with activation of p56lck and as a consequence of signalling via the IL-2 receptor. Further evidence for Nef interfering with cell proliferation was the decreased production of the proto-oncogene c-myb, which is required for cell cycle progression, in Nef-treated MT-2 cells. In contrast to the binding characteristics and biological effects of Nef27, the alternate 25-kDa isoform of Nef (Nef25) produced by translation from the second start codon of HIV nef pNL4-3 (57 nucleotide residues downstream) was shown to interact with only three cellular proteins of approximately 26, 28, and 56 kDa from PBMC and MT-2 cells, one of which was identified as p56lck. Also, proliferation and posttranslational modification of p56lck in response to IL-2 stimulation were not profoundly affected by treatment of PBMC with Nef25 compared with Nef27.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
10573156,Interaction of YB-1 with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat and TAR RNA modulates viral promoter activity.,"Transcriptional regulation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome is mediated by viral and cellular factors. TAR, an unusual RNA regulatory element with a stem-bulge-loop structure at the 5' ends of all nascent viral transcripts is critical for HIV-1 transcription. TAR is the target for Tat, a viral transcription factor encoded early in the HIV-1 life-cycle and essential for gene expression. Evidence demonstrating the interaction of a cellular ssDNA/RNA binding protein, YB-1, with TAR through a region which is important for Tat interaction is presented. Interestingly, results from protein-protein interaction studies revealed that YB-1 can also form a complex with Tat. Results from mapping experiments suggest that while the region spanning aa 125-203 within YB-1 is essential for its association with TAR, a truncated YB-1 spanning aa 1-125 can weakly bind to Tat. Functionally, overexpression of full-length YB-1 enhanced Tat-induced activation of the HIV-1 minimal promoter containing TAR sequences, whereas mutant YB- 1 with no ability to bind to Tat and TAR failed to affect Tat-mediated activation. Expression of mutant YB-1(1-125), which binds to Tat but not RNA, decreased Tat-mediated enhancement of virus transcription. These observations suggest that while full-length YB-1 may function as a facilitator and, by interaction with both Tat and TAR, increase the level of Tat:TAR association, mutant YB-1 with no TAR binding activity, by complexing with Tat, may prevent Tat interaction with TAR. The importance of these findings in light of the proposed mechanism of Tat function is discussed."
12486002,Differential acetylation of Tat coordinates its interaction with the co-activators cyclin T1 and PCAF.,"The HIV-1 transactivator protein, Tat, is an atypical transcriptional activator that functions through binding, not to DNA, but to a short leader RNA, TAR. Although details of its functional mechanism are still unknown, emerging findings suggest that Tat serves primarily to adapt co-activator complexes such as p300, PCAF and P-TEFb to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. Hence, an understanding of how Tat interacts with these cofactors is crucial. It has recently been shown that acetylation at a single lysine, residue 50, regulated the association of Tat with PCAF. Here, we report that in the absence of Tat acetylation, PCAF binds to amino acids 20-40 within Tat. Interestingly, acetylation of Tat at Lys28 abrogates Tat-PCAF interaction. Acetylation at Lys50 creates a new site for binding to PCAF and dictates the formation of a ternary complex of Tat-PCAF-P-TEFb. Thus, differential lysine acetylation of Tat coordinates the interactions with its co-activators, cyclin T1 and PCAF. Our results may help in understanding the ordered recruitment of Tat co-activators to the HIV-1 promoter."
22334672,"Herpes simplex virus ICP27 protein directly interacts with the nuclear pore complex through Nup62, inhibiting host nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways.","The herpes simplex virus ICP27 protein is important for the expression and nuclear export of viral mRNAs. Although several binding sites have been mapped along the ICP27 sequence for various RNA and protein partners, including the transport receptor TAP of the host cell nuclear transport machinery, several aspects of ICP27 trafficking through the nuclear pore complex remain unclear. We investigated if ICP27 could interact directly with the nuclear pore complex itself, finding that ICP27 directly binds the core nucleoporin Nup62. This is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays with purified components. Mapping with ICP27 deletion and point mutants further shows that the interaction requires sequences in both the N and C termini of ICP27. Expression of wild type ICP27 protein inhibited both classical, importin α/β-dependent and transportin-dependent nuclear import. In contrast, an ICP27 point mutant that does not interact with Nup62 had no such inhibitory effect. We suggest that ICP27 association with Nup62 provides additional binding sites at the nuclear pore for ICP27 shuttling, thus supporting ICP27-mediated transport. We propose that ICP27 competes with some host cell transport receptors for binding, resulting in inhibition of those host transport pathways."
22902366,Allosteric competitive inactivation of hematopoietic CSF-1 signaling by the viral decoy receptor BARF1.,"Hematopoietic human colony-stimulating factor 1 (hCSF-1) is essential for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and microbial infections and cancer. The human pathogen Epstein-Barr virus secretes the lytic-cycle protein BARF1 that neutralizes hCSF-1 to achieve immunomodulation. Here we show that BARF1 binds the dimer interface of hCSF-1 with picomolar affinity, away from the cognate receptor-binding site, to establish a long-lived complex featuring three hCSF-1 at the periphery of the BARF1 toroid. BARF1 locks dimeric hCSF-1 into an inactive conformation, rendering it unable to signal via its cognate receptor on human monocytes. This reveals a new functional role for hCSF-1 cooperativity in signaling. We propose a new viral strategy paradigm featuring an allosteric decoy receptor of the competitive type, which couples efficient sequestration and inactivation of the host growth factor to abrogate cooperative assembly of the cognate signaling complex."
25116364,"NUCKS1, a novel Tat coactivator, plays a crucial role in HIV-1 replication by increasing Tat-mediated viral transcription on the HIV-1 LTR promoter.","Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat protein plays an essential role in HIV gene transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and replication. Transcriptional activity of Tat is modulated by several host factors, but the mechanism responsible for Tat regulation by host factors is not understood fully."
22174692,"HIV-1 capsid-cyclophilin interactions determine nuclear import pathway, integration targeting and replication efficiency.","Lentiviruses such as HIV-1 traverse nuclear pore complexes (NPC) and infect terminally differentiated non-dividing cells, but how they do this is unclear. The cytoplasmic NPC protein Nup358/RanBP2 was identified as an HIV-1 co-factor in previous studies. Here we report that HIV-1 capsid (CA) binds directly to the cyclophilin domain of Nup358/RanBP2. Fusion of the Nup358/RanBP2 cyclophilin (Cyp) domain to the tripartite motif of TRIM5 created a novel inhibitor of HIV-1 replication, consistent with an interaction in vivo. In contrast to CypA binding to HIV-1 CA, Nup358 binding is insensitive to inhibition with cyclosporine, allowing contributions from CypA and Nup358 to be distinguished. Inhibition of CypA reduced dependence on Nup358 and the nuclear basket protein Nup153, suggesting that CypA regulates the choice of the nuclear import machinery that is engaged by the virus. HIV-1 cyclophilin-binding mutants CA G89V and P90A favored integration in genomic regions with a higher density of transcription units and associated features than wild type virus. Integration preference of wild type virus in the presence of cyclosporine was similarly altered to regions of higher transcription density. In contrast, HIV-1 CA alterations in another patch on the capsid surface that render the virus less sensitive to Nup358 or TRN-SR2 depletion (CA N74D, N57A) resulted in integration in genomic regions sparse in transcription units. Both groups of CA mutants are impaired in replication in HeLa cells and human monocyte derived macrophages. Our findings link HIV-1 engagement of cyclophilins with both integration targeting and replication efficiency and provide insight into the conservation of viral cyclophilin recruitment."
20212144,Structural characterization of the Z RING-eIF4E complex reveals a distinct mode of control for eIF4E.,"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, a potent oncogene, is highly regulated. One class of eIF4E regulators, including eIF4G and the 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), interact with eIF4E using a conserved YXXXXLPhi-binding site. The structural basis of this interaction and its regulation are well established. Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain containing proteins, such as the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML and the arenaviral protein Z, represent a second class of eIF4E regulators that inhibit eIF4E function by decreasing eIF4E's affinity for its m(7)G cap ligand. To elucidate the structural basis of this inhibition, we determined the structure of Z and studied the Z-eIF4E complex using NMR methods. We show that Z interacts with eIF4E via a novel binding site, which has no homology with that of eIF4G or the 4E-BPs, and is different from the RING recognition site used in the ubiquitin system. Z and eIF4G interact with distinct parts of eIF4E and differentially alter the conformation of the m(7)G cap-binding site. Our results provide a molecular basis for how PML and Z RINGs reduce the affinity of eIF4E for the m(7)G cap and thereby act as key inhibitors of eIF4E function. Furthermore, our findings provide unique insights into RING protein interactions."
19339969,Structural basis for leucine-rich nuclear export signal recognition by CRM1.,"CRM1 (also known as XPO1 and exportin 1) mediates nuclear export of hundreds of proteins through the recognition of the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (LR-NES). Here we present the 2.9 A structure of CRM1 bound to snurportin 1 (SNUPN). Snurportin 1 binds CRM1 in a bipartite manner by means of an amino-terminal LR-NES and its nucleotide-binding domain. The LR-NES is a combined alpha-helical-extended structure that occupies a hydrophobic groove between two CRM1 outer helices. The LR-NES interface explains the consensus hydrophobic pattern, preference for intervening electronegative residues and inhibition by leptomycin B. The second nuclear export signal epitope is a basic surface on the snurportin 1 nucleotide-binding domain, which binds an acidic patch on CRM1 adjacent to the LR-NES site. Multipartite recognition of individually weak nuclear export signal epitopes may be common to CRM1 substrates, enhancing CRM1 binding beyond the generally low affinity LR-NES. Similar energetic construction is also used in multipartite nuclear localization signals to provide broad substrate specificity and rapid evolution in nuclear transport."
9079663,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is a substrate and inhibitor of the interferon-induced, virally activated protein kinase, PKR.","We demonstrate that the interferon-induced, double-stranded (ds) RNA-activated kinase, PKR, is able to bind to and phosphorylate the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) trans-activating protein, Tat. Furthermore, Tat can inhibit the activation and activity of the kinase. Phosphorylation of Tat by PKR is dependent on the prior activation of PKR by dsRNA and occurs on serine and threonine residues adjacent to the basic region important for TAR RNA binding and Tat function. Activated PKR efficiently phosphorylates both the two-exon form of Tat (Tat-86) and the single exon form (Tat-72). Mutagenesis indicates that the interaction between PKR and Tat requires the RNA-binding region of Tat. Tat competes with eukaryotic initiation factor 2, a well-characterized substrate of PKR, for phosphorylation by activated PKR. Tat also inhibits the autophosphorylation of PKR by dsRNA. This biochemical evidence of an intimate relationship between Tat, an important regulator of HIV transcription, and PKR, a pleiotropic cellular regulator, may provide insights into HIV-1 pathogenesis and, more generally, virus/host interactions."
10620360,HIV-I TAT inhibits PKR activity by both RNA-dependent and RNA-independent mechanisms.,"Replication of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is inhibited by interferons (IFNs), in part through activity of the IFN-inducible protein kinase PKR. To escape this antiviral effect, HIV-1 has developed strategies for blocking PKR function. We have previously shown that the HIV-1 Tat protein can associate with PKR in vitro and in vivo and inhibit PKR activity. Here we present evidence that Tat can inhibit PKR activity by both RNA-dependent and RNA-independent mechanisms. Tat inhibited PKR activation by the non-RNA activator heparin, and also suppressed PKR basal level autophosphorylation in the absence of RNA. However, when Tat and dsRNA were preincubated, the amount of Tat required to inhibit PKR activation by dsRNA depended on the dsRNA concentration. In addition to its function in vitro, Tat can also reverse translation inhibition mediated by PKR in COS cells. The Tat amino acid sequence required for interaction with PKR was mapped to residues 40-58, overlapping the hydrophobic core and basic region of HIV-1 Tat. Alignment of amino acid sequences of Tat and eIF-2alpha indicates similarity between the Tat-PKR binding region and the residues around the eIF-2alpha phosphorylation site, suggesting that Tat and eIF-2alpha may bind to the same site on PKR."
8680883,Wild-type and transactivation-defective mutants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein bind human TATA-binding protein in vitro.,"Tat regulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression by increasing both the rate of transcription initiation and the efficiency of transcription elongation. The ability of Tat to facilitate HIV-1 transcription preinitiation complex formation suggests that components of the basal transcriptional machinery may be targeted by Tat. Previous studies have demonstrated that Tat interacts directly with the human TATA-binding protein (TBP) and specific TBP-associated factors (TAFS) that comprise the TFIID complex. Here, in vitro glutathione S-transferase protein binding assays containing fully functional or transactivation-defective mutant Tat proteins have been used to investigate the functional significance of the direct interaction between Tat and TBP relative to Tat transactivation. Results demonstrate that full-length Tat, as well as the activation domain of Tat alone, binds human TBP in vitro. Site-directed mutations within the activation domain of Tat (C22G and P18IS) that abrogate transactivation by Tat in vivo fail to inhibit Tat-TBP binding. Full-length Tat, the activation domain of Tat alone, and a transactivation-defective mutant of Tat that lacks N-terminal amino acid residues 2-36 bind with equal efficiencies to TBP provided that the H1 alpha helical domain that maps to amino acids 167-220 within the highly conserved carboxyl terminus of TBP is maintained. These data indicate that an activity mapped within the activation domain of Tat, which is distinct from Tat-TBP binding. is required for transactivation by Tat."
10329126,Role of the human and murine cyclin T proteins in regulating HIV-1 tat-activation.,"Human cyclin T1 markedly stimulates tat-activation in rodent cells which are normally poorly responsive to the effects of Tat. This result suggests that there are likely to be critical differences in the murine and human cyclin T1 proteins. Here, we analyzed the role of the murine and human cyclin T1 proteins in addition to the human cyclin T2a and T2b proteins on regulating tat-activation. Only the human cyclin T1 protein efficiently formed a complex with Tat bound to TAR RNA. This difference in function was due to the presence of a cysteine residue in human cyclin T1 at position 261 rather than a tyrosine or asparagine residue which are found in the murine cyclin T1 protein and the human cyclin T2a and T2b proteins, respectively. A mouse cyclin T1 protein containing a substitution of tyrosine residue 261 with a cysteine residue, was able to interact with Tat and stimulate tat-transactivation in rodent cells. Likewise, substitution of a cysteine residue for an asparagine residue at position 260 of the cyclin T2a and T2b proteins also resulted in their ability to interact with Tat and stimulate tat-activation in rodent cells. The data indicate that a specific residue in the cyclin T proteins is required for their in vitro interaction with Tat and their ability to stimulate in vivo tat-activation."
12887902,Acetylation of Tat defines a cyclinT1-independent step in HIV transactivation.,"The HIV transcriptional activator Tat is acetylated by p300 at a single lysine residue in the TAR RNA binding domain. We have generated monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific for the acetylated form of Tat (AcTat). Microinjection of anti-AcTat antibodies inhibited Tat-mediated transactivation in cells. Similarly, the p300 inhibitor Lys-CoA and siRNA specific for p300 suppressed Tat transcriptional activity. Full-length synthetic AcTat bound to TAR RNA with the same affinity as unacetylated Tat, but formation of a Tat-TAR-CyclinT1 ternary complex was completely inhibited in the presence of AcTat. We propose that Tat acetylation may help in dissociating the Tat cofactor CyclinT1 from TAR RNA and serve to transfer Tat onto the elongating RNA polymerase II."
10661406,Tat competes with CIITA for the binding to P-TEFb and blocks the expression of MHC class II genes in HIV infection.,"AIDS and the bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) are severe combined immunodeficiencies. BLS results from mutations in genes that regulate the expression of class II major histocompatibility (MHC II) determinants. One of these is the class II transactivator (CIITA). HIV and its transcriptional transactivator (Tat) also block the expression of MHC II genes. By binding to the same surface in the cyclin T1, which together with CDK9 forms the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, Tat inhibits CIITA. CIITA can also activate transcription when tethered artificially to RNA. Moreover, a dominant-negative CDK9 protein inhibits the activity of MHC II promoters. Thus, CIITA is a novel cellular coactivator that binds to P-TEFb for the expression of its target genes."
10329125,Cyclin T1 domains involved in complex formation with Tat and TAR RNA are critical for tat-activation.,"Tat activates transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) by increasing the processivity of RNA polymerase II. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the cellular kinase CDK9 and its binding partner cyclin T1 are involved in regulating transcriptional elongation and tat-activation. Cyclin T1, CDK9 and Tat bind as a complex to elements in TAR RNA that are required for tat-activation. Here, we used cyclin T1 mutants to define domains in this protein that bind to both CDK9 and Tat and are involved in stimulating tat-activation. The region of cyclin T1 extending from amino acid residues 1 to 263 is necessary for complex formation with Tat bound to TAR RNA and for stimulation of tat-activation in murine cells that are normally poorly responsive to the actions of Tat. In contrast, a smaller region of cyclin T1 was required to bind to CDK9 and stimulate its kinase activity. Recombinant cyclin T1 and CDK9 stimulated both basal and tat-induced in vitro transcriptional elongation from the HIV-1 LTR. The effects of Tat on transcriptional elongation may be mediated by its ability to increase CDK9 phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain. These results demonstrate that cyclin T1 interactions with Tat and TAR RNA are critical for activation of HIV-1 gene expression."
11023976,Thrombospondin-1/HIV-1 tat protein interaction: modulation of the biological activity of extracellular Tat.,"Tat protein, a trans-activating factor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1, acts also as an extracellular molecule modulating gene expression, cell survival, growth, transformation, and angiogenesis. Here we demonstrate that human thrombospondin-1 (TSP), a plasma glycoprotein and constituent of the extracellular matrix, binds to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-Tat protein but not to GST. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding of free GST-Tat to immobilized TSP reveals a high-affinity interaction (Kd equal to 25 nM). Accordingly, TSP inhibits cell internalization and HIV-1 LTR trans-activating activity of extracellular Tat in HL3T1 cells with ID50 equal to 10-30 nM. Also, TSP inhibits cell interaction and mitogenic activity of extracellular Tat in T53 Tat-less cells. TSP is instead ineffective when administered after the interaction of Tat with cell surface heparan-sulfate proteoglycans has occurred, in keeping with its ability to prevent but not disrupt Tat/heparin interaction in vitro. Finally, TSP inhibits the autocrine loop of stimulation exerted by endogenous Tat in parental T53 cells. Accordingly, TSP overexpression inhibits cell proliferation, angiogenic activity, and tumorigenic capacity of stable T53 transfectants. Our data demonstrate the ability of TSP to bind to Tat protein and to affect its LTR trans-activating, mitogenic, angiogenic, and tumorigenic activity. These findings suggest that TSP may be implicated in the progression of AIDS and in AIDS-associated pathologies by modulating the bioavailability and biological activity of extracellular Tat."
7608968,Evidence for functional interaction between the HIV-1 Tat transactivator and the TATA box binding protein in vivo.,"Tat strongly activates transcription of the HIV-1 provirus by stimulating both initiation and elongation. This transactivator binds to the TAR RNA element, but can also associate with cellular transcription factors, interacting with upstream promoter sequences. To achieve a better understanding of the role of Tat in the assembly of the transcriptional initiation complex in the living cell, we have examined how the activity of this protein is modified when the general transcription factor involved in the first step of this process, TBP, is overexpressed. The activity of Tat, either wild-type or fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (GBTat), was tested using reporter constructs containing GAL4 binding sites upstream of a minimal promoter corresponding to the HIV-1 TATA box, with or without the TAR element. We found that overexpression of TBP led to a dramatic increase in the activity of the GBTat protein. In order to activate GBTat, TBP must be able to interact with the TATA box. Analysis of several Tat mutants indicated that both the cysteine-rich and the core domains of this transactivator are necessary and sufficient to activate transcription when TBP is overexpressed. In vitro experiments showed that Tat binds specifically to TBP. There was a correlation between the ability of different Tat mutants to bind TBP and their capacity to activate transcription in vivo. With the natural HIV-1 promoter, overexpression of TBP first stimulated and then suppressed the Tat-induced activity. This inhibition was abrogated by an increase in the intracellular levels of Tat. These experimental data indicate that Tat stimulates initiation of transcription by interacting with TBP in vivo."
8764009,Mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of TBP affect the synthesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 full-length and short transcripts similarly.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter generates two types of RNA molecules, full-length transcripts and short transcripts. Synthesis of the short transcripts depends on the inducer of short transcripts (IST), an element located downstream of the start site. In the presence of the viral activator Tat, the synthesis of full-length transcripts is up-regulated while that of short transcripts is down-regulated. Full-length and short transcripts are probably generated by different types of transcription complexes. The first is IST independent, capable of efficient elongation, and up-regulated by Tat. The second is IST dependent, incapable of efficient elongation, and down-regulated by Tat. We have used an in vivo assay to assess the role of TBP in human immunodeficiency virus type I transcription and to test the effect of mutations in TBP on synthesis of full-length and short transcripts. We find that TBP bound to the TATA box is required for the synthesis of short and full-length transcripts as well as for Tat activation and that both yeast TBP and the carboxy-terminal domain of human TBP can replace full-length human TBP for these processes. Mutations in TBP affect the synthesis of short and full-length transcripts as well as Tat activation similarly, and these effects correlate with the previously described effects of these mutations on binding of TBP to the TBP-associated factor TAFII250 in vitro. Together, these results suggest that if short and full-length transcripts are generated by variant transcription complexes, these complexes use TBP similarly, probably as part of the TFIID complex."
9990016,"Interactions between human cyclin T, Tat, and the transactivation response element (TAR) are disrupted by a cysteine to tyrosine substitution found in mouse cyclin T.","The transcriptional transactivator Tat from HIV binds to the transactivation response element (TAR) RNA to increase rates of elongation of viral transcription. Human cyclin T supports these interactions between Tat and TAR. In this study, we report the sequence of mouse cyclin T and identify the residues from positions 1 to 281 in human cyclin T that bind to Tat and TAR. Mouse cyclin T binds to Tat weakly and is unable to facilitate interactions between Tat and TAR. Reciprocal exchanges of the cysteine and tyrosine at position 261 in human and mouse cyclin T proteins also render human cyclin T inactive and mouse cyclin T active. These findings reveal the molecular basis for the restriction of Tat transactivation in rodent cells."
10875611,Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and cellular exportin 1 protein relocalize each other to a subnucleolar structure.,"The exportin 1/crml protein associates with leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NESs) and mediates nuclear export in various experimental systems. We show here that exportin 1 and the NES-containing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 Rev protein relocalize each other to a characteristic dotlike structure within the nucleoli of human cells. On treatment with actinomycin D, Rev remains in these dots longer than in the rest of the nucleoli, arguing that the nucleolar dots do not represent sites of high transport turnover. Transient expression of exportin 1 strongly reduces the expression of a reporter that depends on the export of HIV RNA. When export of hepatitis B virus RNA and simple retrovirus RNA, as well as spliced mRNA, was assayed in this way, exportin 1 inhibited reporter expression to a lesser extent. Thus, an excess of exportin 1 may downregulate Rev-mediated RNA export by sequestering Rev to a subnucleolar structure."
7543368,The HIV-1 Rev activation domain is a nuclear export signal that accesses an export pathway used by specific cellular RNAs.,"HIV-1 Rev protein directs nuclear export of pre-mRNAs and mRNAs containing its binding site, the Rev response element (RRE). To define how Rev acts, we used conjugates between bovine serum albumin (BSA) and peptides comprising the Rev activation domain (BSA-R). BSA-R inhibited Rev-mediated nuclear RNA export, whereas a mutant activation domain peptide conjugate did not. BSA-R did not affect the export of mRNA, tRNA, or ribosomal subunits, but did inhibit export of 5S rRNA and spliceosomal U snRNAs. BSA-R was itself exported from the nucleus in an active, saturable manner. Thus, the Rev activation domain constitutes a nuclear export signal that redirects RRE-containing viral RNAs to a non-mRNA export pathway."
1648487,Evidence for a direct interaction of Rev protein with nuclear envelop mRNA-translocation system.,"The interaction of the Rev protein from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with the nucleocytoplasmic mRNA-transport system was investigated. In gel-shift assay, the recombinant Rev protein used in this study selectively bound to the Rev-responsive element (RRE) region of HIV-1 env-specific RNA. Nitrocellulose-filter-binding studies and Northern/Western-blotting experiments revealed an association constant of approximately 1 x 10(10) M-1. The Rev protein also strongly bound to isolated nuclear envelopes from H9 cells, containing the poly(A)-binding site (= mRNA carrier) and the nucleoside triphosphatase (= NTPase), which are thought to be involved in nuclear export of poly(A)-rich mRNA. Binding of 125I-Rev to a 110-kDa nuclear-envelope protein, the putative mRNA carrier, could be demonstrated in in vitro experiments. Both efflux of cellular poly(A)-rich RNA, such as actin RNA [but not efflux of poly(A)-free RNA] from isolated nuclei and the nuclear-envelope NTPase activity were strongly inhibited by Rev protein. On the other hand, transport of viral env RNA, containing the Rev-responsive element, was increased in the presence of Rev. Studying the release of RNA from closed nuclear-envelope vesicles containing entrapped RNA, the action of Rev was found to occur at the level of translocation of RNA through the nuclear pore. Evidence is presented that Rev down-regulates the NTPase-driven transport of mRNA lacking the RRE, most likely via binding to the mRNA carrier within the envelope. In contrast to the efflux of RRE-free RNA, ATP-dependent efflux of RRE-containing RNA from resealed nuclear-envelope vesicles was found to be increased, if the RNA was entrapped in the vesicles together with Rev protein. In addition, it was found that phosphorylated Rev, which is transported together with RRE-containing RNA out of the vesicles, becomes dephosphorylated during transport. In the vesicle experiments it is demonstrated for the first time that a protein selectively channels a specific mRNA across the nuclear-envelope pore complex."
9111043,Mutations in the nuclear export signal of human ran-binding protein RanBP1 block the Rev-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"We identified a region in the human Ran GTPase-binding protein RanBP1 that shares similarities to the nuclear export signal of the inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Mutational analysis confirmed that this region is responsible for the cytoplasmic accumulation of RanBP1 and can functionally replace the nuclear export signal of Rev of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. We showed that RanBP1 interferes with Rev-mediated expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, whereas the RanBP1 with inactivated nuclear export signal abrogates Rev function. Expression of a Rev-independent molecular clone, which is regulated via the constitutive transport element (CTE) of the simian retrovirus type 1, is not affected. These findings indicate that Rev and RanBP1 compete for the same nuclear export pathway, whereas Rev- and the CTE-mediated pathways are distinct. The inhibition of Rev function is independent of the ability of RanBP1 to associate with Ran and therefore, it is not likely a result of interference with Ran function. These data suggest that RanBP1 interacts with Rev at the putative nuclear receptor and, hence, shares a step in posttranscriptional pathway with Rev."
11836381,Recruitment of the Crm1 nuclear export factor is sufficient to induce cytoplasmic expression of incompletely spliced human immunodeficiency virus mRNAs.,"Cytoplasmic expression of the incompletely spliced RNA transcripts that encode the late, structural proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is dependent on the viral Rev regulatory protein. General agreement exists that Rev acts, at least in part, by recruiting the cellular Crm1 nuclear export factor to HIV-1 transcripts bearing the Rev response element RNA target, and thereby inducing their nuclear egress. However, several groups have argued that Crm1 recruitment may not be sufficient for Rev function. Thus, several additional candidate cofactors for Rev have been proposed, and Rev has also been suggested to also inhibit the nuclear splicing of HIV-1 transcripts and/or to directly enhance their cytoplasmic translation. To examine whether Crm1 recruitment is, instead, sufficient to activate the nuclear export of viral mRNAs, we targeted a leucine-rich Crm1 binding domain, derived from a heterologous protein that normally plays no role in RNA metabolism, to HIV-1 RNAs and showed that this tethered Crm1 binding domain is sufficient to induce the nuclear export and cytoplasmic translation of late HIV-1 mRNA species. More importantly, we show that direct tethering of the Crm1 nuclear export factor to target mRNAs, by fusion to a heterologous RNA binding domain, is in and of itself sufficient to induce the nuclear export and cytoplasmic expression of the unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs that encode the viral Gag proteins."
9654140,Biochemical characterization of HIV-1 Rev as a potent activator of casein kinase II in vitro.,"The stimulatory effects of several DNA-binding basic proteins (histone and protamine) and HIV-1 Rev with arginine (Arg)-rich clusters on the activity of casein kinase II (CK-II) were investigated in vitro. It was found that recombinant Rev (rRev) and the synthetic oligo-fragments corresponding to the amino acid sequences of its Arg-rich cluster stimulate CK-II activity in a dose-dependent manner. The activated CK-II phosphorylates several cellular and viral proteins in HIV-1 infected human MOLT-4 cells, and also phosphorylates HIV-1 structural proteins, including recombinant reverse transcriptase (rRT). These phosphorylations are selectively inhibited by CK-II inhibitors, such as quercetin, oGA (a glycyrrhetinic acid derivative) and NCS-chrom (an enediyne containing antibiotic). The data presented here suggest that HIV-1 Rev acts as an effective potent activator of CK-II, which may be a cellular mediator promoting HIV-1 replication in virus-infected cells."
10722370,Possible role of the plasminogen receptor as a site of interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus p24 immunosuppressive heptapeptide Ch7 with the host immune system.,"Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a synthetic heptapeptide (Ch7: RGSDIAG), corresponding to a conserved sequence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) core protein p24 (amino acids 232- 238), was able to specifically abrogate antigen-induced responses in cultures of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), probably acting at the level of monocytes. The Ch7 peptide displays sequence homology to human plasminogen. In the present report we show that a compound (6-aminoexanoic acid), known to prevent plasminogen binding to monocyte-like cells, greatly reduced the immunosuppressive capacity of Ch7. We suggest that the plasminogen receptor may represent a target structure on human monocytes for the immunosuppressive p24 sequence."

14581576,A bipartite late-budding domain in human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a PTAP motif within the p6 domain of Gag that recruits Tsg101 and associated factors to facilitate virion budding. In this study, we use trans-complementation assays to demonstrate that the PTAP motif acts synergistically with additional p6 sequences to mediate the formation of infectious extracellular HIV-1 virions. These studies suggest that Tsg101 recruitment is necessary but not sufficient to account for late-budding activity exhibited by HIV-1 p6."
11836380,The herpes simplex virus type 1 U(S)11 protein interacts with protein kinase R in infected cells and requires a 30-amino-acid sequence adjacent to a kinase substrate domain.,"The herpes simplex virus type 1 gamma(1)34.5 gene product precludes the host-mediated protein shutoff response induced by activated protein kinase R (PKR). Earlier studies demonstrated that recombinant viruses lacking the gamma(1)34.5 gene (Deltagamma(1)34.5) developed secondary mutations that allowed earlier U(S)11 expression and enabled continued protein synthesis. Further, in vitro studies demonstrated that a recombinant expressed U(S)11 protein binds PKR, blocks the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2alpha) by activated PKR, and, if provided prior to PKR activation, precluded PKR autophosphorylation. The present study furthers the hypothesis that early U(S)11 production precludes PKR-mediated host protein shutoff by demonstrating that (i) U(S)11 and PKR interact in the context of viral infection, (ii) this interaction is RNA dependent and requires a 30-amino-acid domain (amino acids 91 to 121) in the carboxyl domain of the U(S)11 protein, (iii) the proteins biochemically colocalize in the S100 ribosomal fraction, and (iv) there is a PKR substrate domain immediately adjacent to the binding domain. The results suggest that the U(S)11 interaction with PKR at the ribosome is RNA dependent and that the U(S)11 protein contains a substrate domain with homology to eIF-2alpha in close proximity to an essential binding domain."
22908298,Structural insights into Helicobacter pylori oncoprotein CagA interaction with β1 integrin.,"Infection with the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is a risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. Pathogenic strains of H. pylori carry a type IV secretion system (T4SS) responsible for the injection of the oncoprotein CagA into host cells. H. pylori and its cag-T4SS exploit α5β1 integrin as a receptor for CagA translocation. Injected CagA localizes to the inner leaflet of the host cell membrane, where it hijacks host cell signaling and induces cytoskeleton reorganization. Here we describe the crystal structure of the N-terminal ~100-kDa subdomain of CagA at 3.6 Å that unveils a unique combination of folds. The core domain of the protein consists of an extended single-layer β-sheet stabilized by two independent helical subdomains. The core is followed by a long helix that forms a four-helix helical bundle with the C-terminal domain. Mapping of conserved regions in a set of CagA sequences identified four conserved surface-exposed patches (CSP1-4), which represent putative hot-spots for protein-protein interactions. The proximal part of the single-layer β-sheet, covering CSP4, is involved in specific binding of CagA to the β1 integrin, as determined by yeast two-hybrid and in vivo competition assays in H. pylori cell-culture infection studies. These data provide a structural basis for the first step of CagA internalization into host cells and suggest that CagA uses a previously undescribed mechanism to bind β1 integrin to mediate its own translocation."
18641129,Differential requirements for Alix and ESCRT-III in cytokinesis and HIV-1 release.,"The ESCRT machinery functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, namely multivesicular body formation, the terminal stages of cytokinesis and HIV-1 release. Here, we show that the ESCRT-III-binding protein Alix is recruited to the midbody of dividing cells through binding Cep55 via an evolutionarily conserved peptide. Disruption of Cep55/Alix/ESCRT-III interactions causes formation of aberrant midbodies and cytokinetic failure, demonstrating an essential role for these proteins in midbody morphology and cell division. We also show that the C terminus of Alix encodes a multimerization activity that is essential for its function in Alix-dependent HIV-1 release and for interaction with Tsg101. Last, we demonstrate that overexpression of Chmp4b and Chmp4c differentially inhibits HIV-1 release and cytokinesis, suggesting possible reasons for gene expansion within the mammalian Class E VPS pathway."
26845565,BS69/ZMYND11 C-Terminal Domains Bind and Inhibit EBNA2.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) plays an important role in driving immortalization of EBV-infected B cells through regulating the expression of many viral and cellular genes. We report a structural study of the tumor suppressor BS69/ZMYND11 C-terminal region, comprised of tandem coiled-coil-MYND domains (BS69CC-MYND), in complex with an EBNA2 peptide containing a PXLXP motif. The coiled-coil domain of BS69 self-associates to bring two separate MYND domains in close proximity, thereby enhancing the BS69 MYND-EBNA2 interaction. ITC analysis of BS69CC-MYND with a C-terminal fragment of EBNA2 further suggests that the BS69CC-MYND homodimer synergistically binds to the two EBNA2 PXLXP motifs that are respectively located in the conserved regions CR7 and CR8. Furthermore, we showed that EBNA2 interacts with BS69 and down-regulates its expression at both mRNA and protein levels in EBV-infected B cells. Ectopic BS69CC-MYND is recruited to viral target promoters through interactions with EBNA2, inhibits EBNA2-mediated transcription activation, and impairs proliferation of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Substitution of critical residues in the MYND domain impairs the BS69-EBNA2 interaction and abolishes the BS69 inhibition of the EBNA2-mediated transactivation and LCL proliferation. This study identifies the BS69 C-terminal domains as an inhibitor of EBNA2, which may have important implications in development of novel therapeutic strategies against EBV infection."
20042497,"GLTSCR2/PICT-1, a putative tumor suppressor gene product, induces the nucleolar targeting of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus KS-Bcl-2 protein.","KS-Bcl-2, encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is a structural and functional homologue of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators. Like several other Bcl-2 family members, KS-Bcl-2 protects cells from apoptosis and autophagy. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we identified a novel KS-Bcl-2-interacting protein, referred to as protein interacting with carboxyl terminus 1 (PICT-1), encoded by a candidate tumor suppressor gene, GLTSCR2. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed nucleolar localization of PICT-1, whereas KS-Bcl-2 was located mostly at the mitochondrial membranes with a small fraction in the nucleoli. Ectopic expression of PICT-1 resulted in a large increase in the nucleolar fraction of KS-Bcl-2, and only a minor fraction remained in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous PICT-1 abolished the nucleolar localization of KS-Bcl-2. However, ectopically expressed PICT-1 did not alter the cellular distribution of human Bcl-2. Subsequent analysis mapped the crucial amino acid sequences of both KS-Bcl-2 and PICT-1 required for their interaction and for KS-Bcl-2 targeting to the nucleolus. Functional studies suggest a correlation between nucleolar targeting of KS-Bcl-2 by PICT-1 and reduction of the antiapoptotic activity of KS-Bcl-2. Thus, these studies demonstrate a cellular mechanism to sequester KS-Bcl-2 from the mitochondria and to downregulate its virally encoded antiapoptotic activity. Additional characterization of the interaction of KS-Bcl-2 and PICT-1 is likely to shed light on the functions of both proteins."
9060639,Nonstructural protein 3 of hepatitis C virus blocks the distribution of the free catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.,"Chronic hepatitis resulting from hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection develops into cirrhosis in at least half of infected patients and increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenic effects of a number of viruses result from the disturbance of intracellular signal cascades caused by viral antigens. Therefore, we investigated the interaction of nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) of HCV with the cyclic AMP-dependent signal pathway. We found a similarity between the HCV sequence Arg-Arg-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Gly-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ile-Tyr-Arg localized in NS3 and the general consensus sequence of protein kinase A (PKA). Consequently, the catalytic (C) subunit of PKA bound to a bacterially expressed fragment of HCV polyprotein containing amino acid residues 1189 to 1525. When this fragment was introduced into cells, it inhibited the translocation of the C subunit into the nucleus after stimulation with forskolin. The result of this inhibition was significantly reduced histone phosphorylation. Therefore, the presence of NS3 in the cytoplasm of infected cells may affect a wide range of PKA functions and contribute to the pathogenesis of the diseases caused by HCV."
18650809,Structural mechanism of WASP activation by the enterohaemorrhagic E. coli effector EspF(U).,"During infection, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) takes over the actin cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells by injecting the EspF(U) protein into the host cytoplasm. EspF(U) controls actin by activating members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family. Here we show that EspF(U) binds to the autoinhibitory GTPase binding domain (GBD) in WASP proteins and displaces it from the activity-bearing VCA domain (for verprolin homology, central hydrophobic and acidic regions). This interaction potently activates WASP and neural (N)-WASP in vitro and induces localized actin assembly in cells. In the solution structure of the GBD-EspF(U) complex, EspF(U) forms an amphipathic helix that binds the GBD, mimicking interactions of the VCA domain in autoinhibited WASP. Thus, EspF(U) activates WASP by competing directly for the VCA binding site on the GBD. This mechanism is distinct from that used by the eukaryotic activators Cdc42 and SH2 domains, which globally destabilize the GBD fold to release the VCA. Such diversity of mechanism in WASP proteins is distinct from other multimodular systems, and may result from the intrinsically unstructured nature of the isolated GBD and VCA elements. The structural incompatibility of the GBD complexes with EspF(U) and Cdc42/SH2, plus high-affinity EspF(U) binding, enable EHEC to hijack the eukaryotic cytoskeletal machinery effectively."
26365801,Structural Basis for a Novel Interaction between the NS1 Protein Derived from the 1918 Influenza Virus and RIG-I.,"The influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) plays a critical role in antagonizing the innate immune response to infection. One interaction that facilitates this function is between NS1 and RIG-I, one of the main sensors of influenza virus infection. While NS1 and RIG-I are known to interact, it is currently unclear whether this interaction is direct or if it is mediated by other biomolecules. Here we demonstrate a direct, strain-dependent interaction between the NS1 RNA binding domain (NS1(RBD)) of the influenza A/Brevig Mission/1918 H1N1 (1918(H1N1)) virus and the second caspase activation and recruitment domain of RIG-I. Solving the solution structure of the 1918(H1N1) NS1(RBD) revealed features in a functionally novel region that may facilitate the observed interaction. The biophysical and structural data herein suggest a possible mechanism by which strain-specific differences in NS1 modulate influenza virulence."
11907229,"Minute virus of mice NS1 interacts with the SMN protein, and they colocalize in novel nuclear bodies induced by parvovirus infection.","The human survival motor neuron (SMN) gene is the spinal muscular atrophy-determining gene, and a knockout of the murine Smn gene results in preembryonic lethality. Here we show that SMN can directly interact in vitro and in vivo with the large nonstructural protein NS1 of the autonomous parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM), a protein essential for viral replication and a potent transcriptional activator. Typically, SMN localizes within nuclear Cajal bodies and diffusely in the cytoplasm. Following transient NS1expression, SMN and NS1 colocalize within Cajal bodies. At early time points following parvovirus infection, NS1 fails to colocalize with SMN within Cajal bodies; however, during the course of MVM infection, dramatic nuclear alterations occur. Formerly distinct nuclear bodies such as Cajal bodies, promyelocytic leukemia gene product (PML) oncogenic domains (PODs), speckles, and autonomous parvovirus-associated replication (APAR) bodies are seen aggregating at later points in infection. These newly formed large nuclear bodies (termed SMN-associated APAR bodies) are active sites of viral replication and viral capsid assembly. These results highlight the transient nature of nuclear bodies and their contents and identify a novel nuclear body formed during infection. Furthermore, simple transient expression of the viral nonstructural proteins is insufficient to induce this nuclear reorganization, suggesting that this event is induced specifically by a step in the viral infection process."
18971339,Protein kinase PKR mutants resistant to the poxvirus pseudosubstrate K3L protein.,"As part of the mammalian cell innate immune response, the double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase PKR phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha to inhibit protein synthesis and thus block viral replication. Poxviruses including vaccinia and smallpox viruses express PKR inhibitors such as the vaccinia virus K3L protein that resembles the N-terminal substrate-targeting domain of eIF2alpha. Whereas high-level expression of human PKR was toxic in yeast, this growth inhibition was suppressed by coexpression of the K3L protein. We used this yeast assay to screen for PKR mutants that are resistant to K3L inhibition, and we identified 12 mutations mapping to the C-terminal lobe of the PKR kinase domain. The PKR mutations specifically conferred resistance to the K3L protein both in yeast and in vitro. Consistently, the PKR-D486V mutation led to nearly a 15-fold decrease in K3L binding affinity yet did not impair eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Our results support the identification of the eIF2alpha-binding site on an extensive face of the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain, and they indicate that subtle changes to the PKR kinase domain can drastically impact pseudosubstrate inhibition while leaving substrate phosphorylation intact. We propose that these paradoxical effects of the PKR mutations on pseudosubstrate vs. substrate interactions reflect differences between the rigid K3L protein and the plastic nature of eIF2alpha around the Ser-51 phosphorylation site."
23448277,The V86M mutation in HIV-1 capsid confers resistance to TRIM5α by abrogation of cyclophilin A-dependent restriction and enhancement of viral nuclear import.,"HIV-1 is inhibited early after entry into cells expressing some simian orthologues of the tripartite motif protein family member TRIM5α. Mutants of the human orthologue (TRIM5αhu) can also provide protection against HIV-1. The host protein cyclophilin A (CypA) binds incoming HIV-1 capsid (CA) proteins and enhances early stages of HIV-1 replication by unknown mechanisms. On the other hand, the CA-CypA interaction is known to increase HIV-1 susceptibility to restriction by TRIM5α. Previously, the mutation V86M in the CypA-binding loop of HIV-1 CA was found to be selected upon serial passaging of HIV-1 in cells expressing Rhesus macaque TRIM5α (TRIM5αrh). The objectives of this study were (i) to analyze whether V86M CA allows HIV-1 to escape mutants of TRIM5αhu, and (ii) to characterize the role of CypA in the resistance to TRIM5α conferred by V86M."
10500218,"Association of HIV-1 Tat with the cellular protein, Puralpha, is mediated by RNA.","The interaction between two regulatory proteins plays a crucial role in the control of several biological events, including gene transcription. In this report, we demonstrate that the interaction between the cellular sequence-specific single-stranded DNA binding protein Puralpha and the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein is mediated by specific ribonucleic acids. The region of Tat that is important for its interaction with Puralpha includes the region demonstrated to bind Tat's viral RNA target, TAR. A 10-nucleotide GC-rich consensus sequence identified in RNAs associated with Puralpha derived from human U-87MG cells plays an important role in the Puralpha:Tat interaction as examined by an in vitro reconstitution assay. Furthermore, expression of the Puralpha-associated RNA in these cells enhances transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 promoter by Tat and Puralpha."
12491158,Tat-induced deregulation of neuronal differentiation and survival by nerve growth factor pathway.,"HIV-1 enters the brain at the early stage of infection and resides primarily in a limited number of macrophages/microglia and astrocytes. Infection of these cells, however, may not explain the massive neuronal pathology which is seen in AIDS-associated dementia, suggesting a role for factors released from HIV-1 infected cells that trigger a cascade of events leading to neurodegeneration. Our results indicate that Tat, the potent regulatory protein of HIV-1 which is secreted by infected cells and can affect neighboring uninfected cells by transcellular means, can influence multiple biological events that lead to neuronal injury. These findings demonstrate that treatment of neuronal cells with Tat affects MAPK/ERK1/2 activity, the downstream central component of the nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling pathway. Furthermore, our data indicate that treatment of cells with Tat severely decreases expression of p35, a neuron-specific activator of cdk5, a cyclin dependent kinase that phosphorylates several neuronal proteins including neurofilament, and plays an important role in neuronal differentiation and survival. In parallel, Tat can bind to the cellular protein, Puralpha, which associates with cdk5. Further, results from Puralpha knockout animals revealed a decrease in p35 activity, pointing to the importance of Puralpha association with cdk5 in the activity of cdk5:p35 complex. These data demonstrate the cooperativity between HIV-1 Tat and the Puralpha in deregulation of the NGF signal transduction pathway in neuronal cells."
15081896,Quantitative assessment of in vitro interactions implicates TATA-binding protein as a target of the VP16C transcriptional activation region.,"Models of mechanisms of transcriptional activation in eukaryotes frequently invoke direct interactions of transcriptional activation domains with target proteins including general transcription factors or coactivators such as chromatin modifying complexes. The potent transcriptional activation domain (AD) of the VP16 protein of herpes simplex virus has previously been shown to interact with several general transcription factors including the TATA-binding protein (TBP), TBP-associated factor 9 (TAF9), TFIIA, and TFIIB. In surface plasmon resonance assays, a module of the VP16 AD designated VP16C (residues 452-490) bound to TBP with an affinity notably stronger than to TAF9, TFIIA or TFIIB. Moreover, the interaction of VP16C with TBP correlated well with transcriptional activity for a panel of VP16C substitution variants. These results support models in which the interactions of ADs with TBP play an important role in transcriptional activation."
9261344,Transformation and tumorigenic properties of a mutant polyomavirus containing a middle T antigen defective in Shc binding.,"Polyomavirus middle T antigen is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues which act as binding sites for cellular proteins, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and phospholipase C-gamma. In this report we describe the transforming properties and tumor-inducing ability of a polyomavirus that contains a single-site mutation in middle T antigen which changes a tyrosine residue at amino acid position 250 to serine. This mutation disrupts the association of middle T with the transforming protein Shc. The mutant virus is weakly transforming, inducing foci which are smaller and of different morphology than those of the wild type. Although the virus induced tumors in close to 100% of inoculated mice, the spectrum of tumors and their morphology were altered compared to those of wild-type virus. The mutant virus induced a reduced frequency of kidney and thymic tumors. Both the mammary gland and the thymic tumors that were induced were histologically distinct from those induced by wild-type polyomavirus. These results demonstrate that the signal transduction pathway that is deregulated by the middle T-Shc association is important for full transformation of cells in culture and for tumor induction in some target tissues in the mouse-polyomavirus system."
15380361,Structure-functional analysis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpr: role of leucine residues on Vpr-mediated transactivation and virus replication.,"HIV-1 Vpr has been shown to transactivate LTR-directed expression through its interaction with several proteins of cellular origin including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Upon activation, steroid receptors bind to proteins containing the signature motif LxxLL, translocate into the nucleus, bind to their response element, and activate transcription. The presence of such motifs in HIV-1 Vpr has prompted us to undertake the analysis of the role of specific leucine residue(s) involved in Vpr-GR interaction, subcellular localization and its effect on Vpr-GR-mediated transactivation. The individual leucine residues present in H I, II, and III were mutated in the Vpr molecule and evaluated for their ability to interact with GR, transactivate GRE and HIV-1 LTR promoters, and their colocalization with GR. While Vpr mutants L42 and L67 showed reduced activation, substitutions at L20, L23, L26, L39, L64, and L68 exhibited a similar and slightly higher level of activation compared to Vprwt. Interestingly, a substitution at residue L22 resulted in a significantly higher GRE and HIV-1 LTR transactivation (8- to 11-fold higher) in comparison to wild type. Confocal microscopy indicated that Vpr L22A exhibited a distinct condensed nuclear localization pattern different from the nuclear/perinuclear pattern noted with Vprwt. Further, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that the VprL22A-GR complex had higher DNA-binding activity when compared to the wild type Vpr-GR complex. These results suggest a contrasting role for the leucine residues on HIV-1 LTR-directed transactivation dependent upon their location in Vpr."
11257518,Extensive interactions between HIV TAT and TAF(II)250.,"The HIV transactivator, Tat, has been shown to be capable of potent repression of transcription initiation. Repression is mediated by the C-terminal segment of Tat, which binds the TFIID component, TAF(II)250, although the site(s) of interaction were not defined previously. We now report that the interaction between Tat and TAF(II)250 is extensive and involves multiple contacts between the Tat protein and TAF(II)250. The C-terminal domain of Tat, which is necessary for repression of transcription initiation, binds to a segment of TAF(II)250 that encompasses its acetyl transferase (AT) domain (885-1034 amino acids (aa)). Surprisingly, the N-terminal segment of Tat, which contains its activation domains, also binds to TAF(II)250 and interacts with two discontinuous segments of TAF(II)250 located between 885 and 984 aa and 1120 and 1279 aa. Binding of Tat to the 885-984 aa segment of TAF(II)250 requires the cysteine-rich domain of Tat, but not the acidic or glutamine-rich domains. Binding by the N-terminal domain of Tat to the 1120-1279 aa TAF(II)250 segment does not involve the acidic, cysteine- or glutamine-rich domains. Repression of transcription initiation by Tat requires functional TAF(II)250. We now demonstrate that transcription of the HIV LTR does not depend on TAF(II)250 which may account for its resistance to Tat mediated repression."
11278368,HIV-1 Tat protein interacts with mammalian capping enzyme and stimulates capping of TAR RNA.,"HIV gene expression is subject to a transcriptional checkpoint, whereby negative transcription elongation factors induce an elongation block that is overcome by HIV Tat protein in conjunction with P-TEFb. P-TEFb is a cyclin-dependent kinase that catalyzes Tat-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-5 of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD). Ser-5 phosphorylation confers on the CTD the ability to recruit the mammalian mRNA capping enzyme (Mce1) and stimulate its guanylyltransferase activity. Here we show that Tat spearheads a second and novel pathway of capping enzyme recruitment and activation via a direct physical interaction between the C-terminal domain of Tat and Mce1. Tat stimulates the guanylyltransferase and triphosphatase activities of Mce1 and thereby enhances the otherwise low efficiency of cap formation on a TAR stem-loop RNA. Our findings suggest that multiple mechanisms exist for coupling transcription elongation and mRNA processing."
8331728,The basic domain of Rev from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 specifically blocks the entry of U4/U6.U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein in spliceosome assembly.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a regulatory protein, Rev, which is required for cytoplasmic expression of incompletely spliced viral mRNA. Rev binds to a cis-acting Rev-responsive element (RRE) located within the env region of HIV-1. It has previously been shown that a 17-amino-acid peptide, corresponding to the basic domain of Rev, specifically inhibited in vitro the splicing of mRNAs containing the RRE. In this reaction, the peptide acts after an ATP-dependent step in the spliceosome assembly resulting in an accumulation of a 45-50S splicing-deficient complex. Characterization of this complex revealed that the basic domain of Rev does not interfere with U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein binding but blocks the entry of U4, U5, and U6 small nuclear RNAs into the spliceosome. Binding of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein was partially inhibited. The critical nature of the oligomeric structure of RRE has been investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Reporter genes that contained one, three, or six repeated-monomer high-affinity Rev binding sites (IIB) within an intron yielded a correlation among the oligomeric state of bound Rev; inhibition of splicing; ability to block the assembly of U4, U5, and U6 small nuclear RNAs in the spliceosome in vitro; and level of Rev response in vivo."
11762979,"""Tissue"" transglutaminase expression in HIV-infected cells: an enzyme with an antiviral effect?","The cytopathic effect of HIV has been shown to be associated with the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of proliferation of T cells. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms at the basis of the dramatic immune cell loss caused by HIV in patients suffering from acquired immunodeficient syndrome (AIDS), are not yet fully established. We demonstrated that ""tissue"" transglutaminase (tTG) gene expression is induced in the immune system of seropositive individuals (peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph nodes). tTG is a multifunctional protein involved in a variety of fundamentally important cellular functions, in addition to cell death by apoptosis. The presence of high tTG levels in immune-competent cells of HIV+ persons might exert an important role in HIV-infection by influencing viral production. We propose that, in addition to its multiple functions, tTG might interfere with HIV replication by altering the viral mRNA trafficking between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This effect might be due to its specific interaction with eIF5A, a cellular partner of HIV Rev protein, which is essential for HIV replication in immune-competent cells. Given the presence of high tTG levels in HIV+ individuals, it would be of interest to pursue the potential role of this multifunctional protein in the development of strategies aimed at the pharmacologic regulation of HIV production."
9023367,HIV Rev-dependent binding of SF2/ASF to the Rev response element: possible role in Rev-mediated inhibition of HIV RNA splicing.,"Production of the structural and enzymatic proteins of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is controlled by the rev regulatory gene product. The 116-amino acid Rev protein acts by binding to the Rev response element (RRE), a complex RNA stem-loop structure located within the env gene of HIV. Rev exerts a series of posttranscriptional effects, including the inhibition of viral RNA splicing, the activation of nuclear export of incompletely spliced viral RNAs, and the enhancement of translation of RRE-containing RNAs. Our studies now demonstrate that at least one member of the SR family of splicing factors, SF2/ASF, specifically binds to a subregion of the RRE in vitro in a Rev-dependent manner. Furthermore, expression of high levels of SF2/ASF inhibits Rev function and impairs HIV replication in vivo. Both the in vitro binding of SF2/ASF to the Rev/RRE complex and the in vivo inhibition of Rev action by SF2/ASF are abrogated by mutation of the N-terminal RNA recognition motif but are not affected by mutation of the C-terminal arginine-serine-rich domain. These findings suggest that Rev inhibition of HIV splicing likely involves recruitment of the essential splicing factor SF2/ASF to the Rev/RRE complex. However, these inhibitory effects of Rev on viral RNA splicing are apparently overcome by augmenting the intracellular levels of SF2/ASF expression."
17135252,The VP16 activation domain establishes an active mediator lacking CDK8 in vivo.,"VP16 has been widely used to unravel the mechanisms underlying gene transcription. Much of the previous work has been conducted in reconstituted in vitro systems. Here we study the formation of transcription complexes at stable reporters under the control of an inducible Tet-VP16 activator in living cells. In this simplified model for gene activation VP16 recruits the general factors and the cofactors Mediator, GCN5, CBP, and PC4, within minutes to the promoter region. Activation is accompanied by only minor changes in histone acetylation and H3K4 methylation but induces a marked promoter-specific increase in H3K79 methylation. Mediated through contacts with VP16 several subunits of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPSF/CstF) are concentrated at the promoter region. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that VP16 activates transcription through a specific MED25-associated Mediator, which is deficient in CDK8."
27758855,"Core Binding Factor β Protects HIV, Type 1 Accessory Protein Viral Infectivity Factor from MDM2-mediated Degradation.","HIV, type 1 overcomes host restriction factor apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) proteins by organizing an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex together with viral infectivity factor (Vif) and a host transcription cofactor core binding factor β (CBFβ). CBFβ is essential for Vif to counteract APOBEC3 by enabling the recruitment of cullin 5 to the complex and increasing the steady-state level of Vif protein; however, the mechanisms by which CBFβ up-regulates Vif protein remains unclear. Because we have reported previously that mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) is an E3 ligase for Vif, we hypothesized that CBFβ might protect Vif from MDM2-mediated degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that Vif mutants that do not bind to CBFβ preferentially interact with MDM2 and that overexpression of CBFβ disrupts the interaction between MDM2 and Vif. Knockdown of CBFβ reduced the steady-state level of Vif in MDM2-proficient cells but not in MDM2-null cells. Cycloheximide chase analyses revealed that Vif E88A/W89A, which does not interact with CBFβ, degraded faster than wild-type Vif in MDM2-proficient cells but not in MDM2-null cells, suggesting that Vif stabilization by CBFβ is mainly caused by impairing MDM2-mediated degradation. We identified Vif R93E as a Vif variant that does not bind to MDM2, and the virus with this substitution mutation was more resistant to APOBEC3G than the parental virus. Combinatory substitution of Vif residues required for CBFβ binding and MDM2 binding showed full recovery of Vif steady-state levels, supporting our hypothesis. Our data provide new insights into the mechanism of Vif augmentation by CBFβ."
21970979,Human immunodeficiency virus-1 Nef suppresses Hsp70-mediated Tat activation.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) contains binding sites for several host transcription factors that contribute to HIV-1 gene expression. Although previous reports have indicated that HIV-1 Nef positively or negatively regulates HIV-1 gene expression, the precise molecular mechanisms by which this occurs remain largely unknown. In this study, we report that Nef suppressed LTR-driven transcription only in the presence of HIV-1 Tat, which was localized to the cytoplasm and degraded by the proteasome. However, the depletion of Hsp70 was found to reduce the suppressive effect of Nef on HIV-1 gene expression. These results suggest that Nef suppresses Hsp70-mediated HIV-1 Tat activation."
28611246,Inhibition of Avian Influenza A Virus Replication in Human Cells by Host Restriction Factor TUFM Is Correlated with Autophagy.,"Avian influenza A viruses generally do not replicate efficiently in human cells, but substitution of glutamic acid (Glu, E) for lysine (Lys, K) at residue 627 of avian influenza virus polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) can serve to overcome host restriction and facilitate human infectivity.

11086025,Interaction between complement receptor gC1qR and hepatitis C virus core protein inhibits T-lymphocyte proliferation.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important human pathogen that is remarkably efficient at establishing persistent infection. The HCV core protein is the first protein expressed during the early phase of HCV infection. Our previous work demonstrated that the HCV core protein suppresses host immune responses, including anti-viral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses in a murine model. To investigate the mechanism of HCV core-mediated immunosuppression, we searched for host proteins capable of associating with the core protein using a yeast two-hybrid system. Using the core protein as bait, we screened a human T cell-enriched expression library and identified a gene encoding the gC1q receptor (gC1qR). C1q is a ligand of gC1qR and is involved in the early host defense against infection. Like C1q, HCV core can inhibit T-cell proliferative responses in vitro. This core-induced anti-T-cell proliferation is reversed by addition of anti-gC1qR Ab in a T-cell proliferation assay. Furthermore, biochemical analysis of the interaction between core and gC1qR indicates that HCV core binds the region spanning amino acids 188 to 259 of gC1qR, a site distinct from the binding region of C1q. The inhibition of T-cell responsiveness by HCV core may have important implications for HCV persistence in humans."

18343844,Identification of residues in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of human coronavirus NL63 that are critical for the RBD-ACE2 receptor interaction.,"Human coronavirus NL63 (NL63), a member of the group I coronaviruses, may cause acute respiratory diseases in young children and immunocompromised adults. Like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), NL63 also employs the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor for cellular entry. To identify residues in the spike protein of NL63 that are important for hACE2 binding, this study first generated a series of S1-truncated variants, examined their associations with the hACE2 receptor and subsequently mapped a minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD) that consisted of 141 residues (aa 476-616) towards the C terminus of the S1 domain. The data also demonstrated that the NL63 RBD bound to hACE2 more efficiently than its full-length counterpart and had a binding efficiency comparable to the S1 or RBD of SARS-CoV. A further series of RBD variants was generated using site-directed mutagenesis and random mutant library screening assays, and identified 15 residues (C497, Y498, V499, C500, K501, R518, R530, V531, G534, G537, D538, S540, E582, W585 and T591) that appeared to be critical for the RBD-hACE2 association. These critical residues clustered in three separate regions (designated RI, RII and RIII) inside the RBD, which may represent three receptor-binding sites. These results may help to delineate the molecular interactions between the S protein of NL63 and the hACE2 receptor, and may also enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of NL63 and SARS-CoV."
22152002,Rotavirus nonstructural protein 1 antagonizes innate immune response by interacting with retinoic acid inducible gene I.,"The nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) of rotavirus has been reported to block interferon (IFN) signaling by mediating proteasome-dependent degradation of IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs) and (or) the β-transducin repeat containing protein (β-TrCP). However, in addition to these targets, NSP1 may subvert innate immune responses via other mechanisms."
22048310,Adherens junction protein nectin-4 is the epithelial receptor for measles virus.,"Measles virus is an aerosol-transmitted virus that affects more than 10 million children each year and accounts for approximately 120,000 deaths. Although it was long believed to replicate in the respiratory epithelium before disseminating, it was recently shown to infect initially macrophages and dendritic cells of the airways using signalling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1; also called CD150) as a receptor. These cells then cross the respiratory epithelium and transport the infection to lymphatic organs where measles virus replicates vigorously. How and where the virus crosses back into the airways has remained unknown. On the basis of functional analyses of surface proteins preferentially expressed on virus-permissive human epithelial cell lines, here we identify nectin-4 (ref. 8; also called poliovirus-receptor-like-4 (PVRL4)) as a candidate host exit receptor. This adherens junction protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily interacts with the viral attachment protein with high affinity through its membrane-distal domain. Nectin-4 sustains measles virus entry and non-cytopathic lateral spread in well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial sheets infected basolaterally. It is downregulated in infected epithelial cells, including those of macaque tracheae. Although other viruses use receptors to enter hosts or transit through their epithelial barriers, we suggest that measles virus targets nectin-4 to emerge in the airways. Nectin-4 is a cellular marker of several types of cancer, which has implications for ongoing measles-virus-based clinical trials of oncolysis."
21378963,Structure of the VP16 transactivator target in the Mediator.,"The human Mediator coactivator complex interacts with many transcriptional activators and facilitates recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promote target gene transcription. The MED25 subunit is a critical target of the potent herpes simplex 1 viral transcriptional activator VP16. Here we determine the solution structure of the MED25 VP16-binding domain (VBD) and define its binding site for the N-terminal portion of the VP16 transactivation domain (TADn). A hydrophobic furrow, formed by a β-barrel and two α-helices in MED25 VBD, interacts tightly with VP16 TADn. Mutations in this furrow prevent binding of VP16 TAD to MED25 VBD and interfere with the ability of overexpressed MED25 VBD to inhibit VP16-dependent transcriptional activation in vivo. This detailed molecular understanding of transactivation by the benchmark activator VP16 could provide important insights into viral and cellular gene activation mechanisms."
21378965,Structure and VP16 binding of the Mediator Med25 activator interaction domain.,"Eukaryotic transcription is regulated by interactions between gene-specific activators and the coactivator complex Mediator. Here we report the NMR structure of the Mediator subunit Med25 (also called Arc92) activator interaction domain (ACID) and analyze the structural and functional interaction of ACID with the archetypical acidic transcription activator VP16. Unlike other known activator targets, ACID forms a seven-stranded β-barrel framed by three helices. The VP16 subdomains H1 and H2 bind to opposite faces of ACID and cooperate during promoter-dependent activated transcription in a in vitro system. The activator-binding ACID faces are functionally required and conserved among higher eukaryotes. Comparison with published activator structures reveals that the VP16 activation domain uses distinct interaction modes to adapt to unrelated target surfaces and folds that evolved for activator binding."
24874105,Interaction studies of the human and Arabidopsis thaliana Med25-ACID proteins with the herpes simplex virus VP16- and plant-specific Dreb2a transcription factors.,"Mediator is an evolutionary conserved multi-protein complex present in all eukaryotes. It functions as a transcriptional co-regulator by conveying signals from activators and repressors to the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. The Arabidopsis thaliana Med25 (aMed25) ACtivation Interaction Domain (ACID) interacts with the Dreb2a activator which is involved in plant stress response pathways, while Human Med25-ACID (hMed25) interacts with the herpes simplex virus VP16 activator. Despite low sequence similarity, hMed25-ACID also interacts with the plant-specific Dreb2a transcriptional activator protein. We have used GST pull-down-, surface plasmon resonance-, isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR chemical shift experiments to characterize interactions between Dreb2a and VP16, with the hMed25 and aMed25-ACIDs. We found that VP16 interacts with aMed25-ACID with similar affinity as with hMed25-ACID and that the binding surface on aMed25-ACID overlaps with the binding site for Dreb2a. We also show that the Dreb2a interaction region in hMed25-ACID overlaps with the earlier reported VP16 binding site. In addition, we show that hMed25-ACID/Dreb2a and aMed25-ACID/Dreb2a display similar binding affinities but different binding energetics. Our results therefore indicate that interaction between transcriptional regulators and their target proteins in Mediator are less dependent on the primary sequences in the interaction domains but that these domains fold into similar structures upon interaction."
26915086,Molecular Probing of the HPV-16 E6 Protein Alpha Helix Binding Groove with Small Molecule Inhibitors.,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) HPV E6 protein has emerged as a central oncoprotein in HPV-associated cancers in which sustained expression is required for tumor progression. A majority of the E6 protein interactions within the human proteome use an alpha-helix groove interface for binding. The UBE3A/E6AP HECT domain ubiquitin ligase binds E6 at this helix-groove interface. This enables formation of a trimeric complex with p53, resulting in destruction of this tumor suppressor. While recent x-ray crystal structures are useful, examples of small molecule probes that can modulate protein interactions at this interface are limited. To develop insights useful for potential structure-based design of ligands for HPV E6, a series of 2,6-disubstituted benzopyranones were prepared and tested as competitive antagonists of E6-E6AP helix-groove interactions. These small molecule probes were used in both binding and functional assays to evaluate recognition features of the E6 protein. Evidence for an ionic functional group interaction within the helix groove was implicated by the structure-activity among the highest affinity ligands. The molecular topographies of these protein-ligand interactions were evaluated by comparing the binding and activities of single amino acid E6 mutants with the results of molecular dynamic simulations. A group of arginine residues that form a rim-cap over the E6 helix groove offer compensatory roles in binding and recognition of the small molecule probes. The flexibility and impact on the overall helix-groove shape dictated by these residues offer new insights for structure-based targeting of HPV E6."
23486063,Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC.,"Most human coronaviruses cause mild upper respiratory tract disease but may be associated with more severe pulmonary disease in immunocompromised individuals. However, SARS coronavirus caused severe lower respiratory disease with nearly 10% mortality and evidence of systemic spread. Recently, another coronavirus (human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC)) was identified in patients with severe and sometimes lethal lower respiratory tract infection. Viral genome analysis revealed close relatedness to coronaviruses found in bats. Here we identify dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a functional receptor for hCoV-EMC. DPP4 specifically co-purified with the receptor-binding S1 domain of the hCoV-EMC spike protein from lysates of susceptible Huh-7 cells. Antibodies directed against DPP4 inhibited hCoV-EMC infection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells and Huh-7 cells. Expression of human and bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) DPP4 in non-susceptible COS-7 cells enabled infection by hCoV-EMC. The use of the evolutionarily conserved DPP4 protein from different species as a functional receptor provides clues about the host range potential of hCoV-EMC. In addition, it will contribute critically to our understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this emerging human coronavirus, and may facilitate the development of intervention strategies."
27708164,Superantigens hyperinduce inflammatory cytokines by enhancing the B7-2/CD28 costimulatory receptor interaction.,"Full T-cell activation requires interaction between the costimulatory receptors B7-2 and CD28. By binding CD28, bacterial superantigens elicit harmful inflammatory cytokine overexpression through an unknown mechanism. We show that, by engaging not only CD28 but also its coligand B7-2 directly, superantigens potently enhance the avidity between B7-2 and CD28, inducing thereby T-cell hyperactivation. Using the same 12-aa β-strand-hinge-α-helix domain, superantigens engage both B7-2 and CD28 at their homodimer interfaces, areas remote from where these coreceptors interact, implying that inflammatory signaling can be controlled through the receptor homodimer interfaces. Short B7-2 dimer interface mimetic peptides bind diverse superantigens, prevent superantigen binding to cell-surface B7-2 or CD28, attenuate inflammatory cytokine overexpression, and protect mice from lethal superantigen challenge. Thus, superantigens induce a cytokine storm not only by mediating the interaction between MHC-II molecule and T-cell receptor but also, critically, by promoting B7-2/CD28 coreceptor engagement, forcing the principal costimulatory axis to signal excessively. Our results reveal a role for B7-2 as obligatory receptor for superantigens. B7-2 homodimer interface mimotopes prevent superantigen lethality by blocking the superantigen-host costimulatory receptor interaction."
29426014,Network Analysis of UBE3A/E6AP-Associated Proteins Provides Connections to Several Distinct Cellular Processes.,"Perturbations in activity and dosage of the UBE3A ubiquitin-ligase have been linked to Angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorders. UBE3A was initially identified as the cellular protein hijacked by the human papillomavirus E6 protein to mediate the ubiquitylation of p53, a function critical to the oncogenic potential of these viruses. Although a number of substrates have been identified, the normal cellular functions and pathways affected by UBE3A are largely unknown. Previously, we showed that UBE3A associates with HERC2, NEURL4, and MAPK6/ERK3 in a high-molecular-weight complex of unknown function that we refer to as the HUN complex (HERC2, UBE3A, and NEURL4). In this study, the combination of two complementary proteomic approaches with a rigorous network analysis revealed cellular functions and pathways in which UBE3A and the HUN complex are involved. In addition to finding new UBE3A-associated proteins, such as MCM6, SUGT1, EIF3C, and ASPP2, network analysis revealed that UBE3A-associated proteins are connected to several fundamental cellular processes including translation, DNA replication, intracellular trafficking, and centrosome regulation. Our analysis suggests that UBE3A could be involved in the control and/or integration of these cellular processes, in some cases as a component of the HUN complex, and also provides evidence for crosstalk between the HUN complex and CAMKII interaction networks. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the cellular functions of UBE3A and its potential role in pathways that may be affected in Angelman syndrome, UBE3A-associated autism spectrum disorders, and human papillomavirus-associated cancers."
14972559,The human immunodeficiency virus Vpr protein binds Cdc25C: implications for G2 arrest.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encodes a gene product, Vpr, which causes infected cells to arrest or delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The arrest in G2 is characterized by low levels of Cyclin B1-p34Cdc2 activity and corresponding inhibitory phosphorylation of p34Cdc2. We find that Vpr directly inhibits the in vitro activity of a phosphatase, Cdc25C, which normally activates Cyclin B1-p34Cdc2. Vpr binds to Cdc25C both in vitro and in mammalian cells. Vpr is also able to inhibit Cdc25C phosphatase activity in vitro although it binds to a site on Cdc25C that is distinct from the catalytic site of the enzyme. Expression of both a catalytically active mutant of Cdc25C that has reduced binding to Vpr as well as a catalytically inactive mutant of Cdc25C that retains binding to Vpr is able to largely overcome Vpr-mediated G2 arrest. Finally, depletion of Cdc25C from cells also renders them partially resistant to the effects of Vpr."
8849451,Tat-SF1: cofactor for stimulation of transcriptional elongation by HIV-1 Tat.,"Tat may stimulate transcriptional elongation by recruitment of a complex containing Tat-SF1 and a kinase to the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) promoter through a Tat-TAR interaction. A complementary DNA for the cellular activity, Tat-SF1, has been isolated. This factor is required for Tat trans-activation and is a substrate of an associated cellular kinase. Cotransfection with the complementary DNA for Tat-SF1 specifically modulates Tat activation. Tat-SF1 contains two RNA recognition motifs and a highly acidic carboxyl-terminal half. It is distantly related to EWS and FUS/TLS, members of a family of putative transcription factors with RNA recognition motifs that are associated with sarcomas."
16512683,140 mouse brain proteins identified by Ca2+-calmodulin affinity chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry.,"Calmodulin is an essential Ca2+-binding protein that binds to a variety of targets that carry out critical signaling functions. We describe the proteomic characterization of mouse brain Ca2+-calmodulin-binding proteins that were purified using calmodulin affinity chromatography. Proteins in the eluates from four different affinity chromatography experiments were identified by 1-DE and in-gel digestion followed by LC-MS/MS. Parallel experiments were performed using two related control-proteins belonging to the EF-hand family. After comparing the results from the different experiments, we were able to exclude a significant number of proteins suspected to bind in a nonspecific manner. A total of 140 putative Ca2+-calmodulin-binding proteins were identified of which 87 proteins contained calmodulin-binding motifs. Among the 87 proteins that contained calmodulin-binding motifs, 48 proteins have not previously been shown to interact with calmodulin and 39 proteins were known calmodulin-binding proteins. Many proteins with ill-defined functions were identified as well as a number of proteins that at the time of the analysis were described only as ORFs. This study provides a functional framework for studies on these previously uncharacterized proteins."
26789921,"Targeting Viral Proteostasis Limits Influenza Virus, HIV, and Dengue Virus Infection.","Viruses are obligate parasites and thus require the machinery of the host cell to replicate. Inhibition of host factors co-opted during active infection is a strategy hosts use to suppress viral replication and a potential pan-antiviral therapy. To define the cellular proteins and processes required for a virus during infection is thus crucial to understanding the mechanisms of virally induced disease. In this report, we generated fully infectious tagged influenza viruses and used infection-based proteomics to identify pivotal arms of cellular signaling required for influenza virus growth and infectivity. Using mathematical modeling and genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we revealed that modulation of Sec61-mediated cotranslational translocation selectively impaired glycoprotein proteostasis of influenza as well as HIV and dengue viruses and led to inhibition of viral growth and infectivity. Thus, by studying virus-human protein-protein interactions in the context of active replication, we have identified targetable host factors for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies."
23326450,"Identification of new protein interactions between dengue fever virus and its hosts, human and mosquito.","The four divergent serotypes of dengue virus are the causative agents of dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. About two-fifths of the world's population live in areas where dengue is prevalent, and thousands of deaths are caused by the viruses every year. Dengue virus is transmitted from one person to another primarily by the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Recent studies have begun to define how the dengue viral proteins interact with host proteins to mediate viral replication and pathogenesis. A combined analysis of these studies, however, suggests that many virus-host protein interactions remain to be identified, especially for the mosquito host. In this study, we used high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screening to identify mosquito and human proteins that physically interact with dengue proteins. We tested each identified host protein against the proteins from all four serotypes of dengue to identify interactions that are conserved across serotypes. We further confirmed many of the interactions using co-affinity purification assays. As in other large-scale screens, we identified some previously detected interactions and many new ones, moving us closer to a complete host - dengue protein interactome. To help summarize and prioritize the data for further study, we combined our interactions with other published data and identified a subset of the host-dengue interactions that are now supported by multiple forms of evidence. These data should be useful for understanding the interplay between dengue and its hosts and may provide candidates for drug targets and vector control strategies."
11264375,Evaluation of interactions of human cytomegalovirus immediate-early IE2 regulatory protein with small ubiquitin-like modifiers and their conjugation enzyme Ubc9.,"The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major immediate-early protein IE2 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that is believed to be a key regulator in both lytic and latent infections. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3) and a SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) were isolated as IE2-interacting proteins. In vitro binding assays with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins provided evidence for direct protein-protein interaction. Mapping data showed that the C-terminal end of SUMO-1 is critical for interaction with IE2 in both yeast and in vitro binding assays. IE2 was efficiently modified by SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 in cotransfected cells and in cells infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing HCMV IE2, although the level of modification was much lower in HCMV-infected cells. Two lysine residues at positions 175 and 180 were mapped as major alternative SUMO-1 conjugation sites in both cotransfected cells and an in vitro sumoylation assay and could be conjugated by SUMO-1 simultaneously. Although mutations of these lysine residues did not interfere with the POD (or ND10) targeting of IE2, overexpression of SUMO-1 enhanced IE2-mediated transactivation in a promoter-dependent manner in reporter assays. Interestingly, many other cellular proteins identified as IE2 interaction partners in yeast two-hybrid assays also interact with SUMO-1, suggesting that either directly bound or covalently conjugated SUMO moieties may act as a bridge for interactions between IE2 and other SUMO-1-modified or SUMO-1-interacting proteins. When we investigated the intracellular localization of SUMO-1 in HCMV-infected cells, the pattern changed from nuclear punctate to predominantly nuclear diffuse in an IE1-dependent manner at very early times after infection, but with some SUMO-1 protein now associated with IE2 punctate domains. However, at late times after infection, SUMO-1 was predominantly detected within viral DNA replication compartments containing IE2. Taken together, these results show that HCMV infection causes the redistribution of SUMO-1 and that IE2 both physically binds to and is covalently modified by SUMO moieties, suggesting possible modulation of both the function of SUMO-1 and protein-protein interactions of IE2 during HCMV infection."
10684265,Covalent modification of the transactivator protein IE2-p86 of human cytomegalovirus by conjugation to the ubiquitin-homologous proteins SUMO-1 and hSMT3b.,"The 86-kDa IE2 protein (IE2-p86) of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a potent transactivator of viral as well as cellular promoters. Several lines of evidence indicate that this broad transactivation spectrum is mediated by protein-protein interactions. To identify novel cellular binding partners, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a N-terminal deletion mutant of IE2-p86 comprising amino acids 135 to 579 as a bait. Here, we report the isolation of two ubiquitin-homologous proteins, SUMO-1 and hSMT3b, as well as their conjugating activity hUBC9 (human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9) as specific interaction partners of HCMV IE2. The polypeptides SUMO-1 and hSMT3b have previously been shown to be covalently coupled to a subset of nuclear proteins such as the nuclear domain 10 (ND10) proteins PML and Sp100 in a manner analogous to ubiquitinylation, which we call SUMOylation. By Western blot analysis, we were able to show that the IE2-p86 protein can be partially converted to a 105-kDa isoform in a dose-dependent manner after cotransfection of an epitope-tagged SUMO-1. Immunoprecipitation experiments of the conjugated isoforms using denaturing conditions further confirmed the covalent coupling of SUMO-1 or hSMT3b to IE2-p86 both after transient transfection and after lytic infection of human primary fibroblasts. Moreover, we defined two modification sites within IE2, located in an immediate vicinity at amino acid positions 175 and 180, which appear to be used alternatively for coupling. By using a SUMOylation-defective mutant, we showed that the targeting of IE2-p86 to ND10 occurs independent of this modification. However, a strong reduction of IE2-mediated transactivation of two viral early promoters and a heterologous promoter was observed in cotransfection analysis with the SUMOylation-defective mutant. This suggests a functional relevance of covalent modification by ubiquitin-homologous proteins for IE2-mediated transactivation, possibly by providing an additional interaction motif for cellular cofactors."
14980221,"TFIIH transcription factor, a target for the Rift Valley hemorrhagic fever virus.","The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is the causative agent of fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and acute hepatitis in ruminants. We found that infection by RVFV leads to a rapid and drastic suppression of host cellular RNA synthesis that parallels a decrease of the TFIIH transcription factor cellular concentration. Using yeast two hybrid system, recombinant technology, and confocal microscopy, we further demonstrated that the nonstructural viral NSs protein interacts with the p44 component of TFIIH to form nuclear filamentous structures that also contain XPB subunit of TFIIH. By competing with XPD, the natural partner of p44 within TFIIH, and sequestering p44 and XPB subunits, NSs prevents the assembly of TFIIH subunits, thus destabilizing the normal host cell life. These observations shed light on the mechanism utilized by RVFV to evade the host response."
27044079,Pathogen receptor discovery with a microfluidic human membrane protein array.,"The discovery of how a pathogen invades a cell requires one to determine which host cell receptors are exploited. This determination is a challenging problem because the receptor is invariably a membrane protein, which represents an Achilles heel in proteomics. We have developed a universal platform for high-throughput expression and interaction studies of membrane proteins by creating a microfluidic-based comprehensive human membrane protein array (MPA). The MPA is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind and offers a powerful alternative to conventional proteomics by enabling the simultaneous study of 2,100 membrane proteins. We characterized direct interactions of a whole nonenveloped virus (simian virus 40), as well as those of the hepatitis delta enveloped virus large form antigen, with candidate host receptors expressed on the MPA. Selected newly discovered membrane protein-pathogen interactions were validated by conventional methods, demonstrating that the MPA is an important tool for cellular receptor discovery and for understanding pathogen tropism."
21418524,Substrate preference and phosphatidylinositol monophosphate inhibition of the catalytic domain of the Per-Arnt-Sim domain kinase PASKIN.,"The Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain serine/threonine kinase PASKIN, or PAS kinase, links energy flux and protein synthesis in yeast, regulates glycogen synthesis and protein translation in mammals, and might be involved in insulin regulation in the pancreas. According to the current model, binding of a putative ligand to the PAS domain disinhibits the kinase domain, leading to PASKIN autophosphorylation and increased kinase activity. To date, only synthetic but no endogenous PASKIN ligands have been reported. In the present study, we identified a number of novel PASKIN kinase targets, including ribosomal protein S6. Together with our previous identification of eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1, this suggests a role for PASKIN in the regulation of mammalian protein translation. When searching for endogenous PASKIN ligands, we found that various phospholipids can bind PASKIN and stimulate its autophosphorylation. Interestingly, the strongest binding and autophosphorylation was achieved with monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositols. However, stimulated PASKIN autophosphorylation did not correlate with ribosomal protein S6 and eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 target phosphorylation. Although autophosphorylation was enhanced by monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositols, di- and tri-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols inhibited autophosphorylation. By contrast, target phosphorylation was always inhibited, with the highest efficiency for di- and tri-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols. Because phosphatidylinositol monophosphates were found to interact with the kinase rather than with the PAS domain, these data suggest a multiligand regulation of PASKIN activity, including a still unknown PAS domain binding/activating ligand and kinase domain binding modulatory phosphatidylinositol phosphates."
20701745,"Karyopherin alpha7 (KPNA7), a divergent member of the importin alpha family of nuclear import receptors.","Classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) dependent nuclear import is carried out by a heterodimer of importin alpha and importin beta. NLS cargo is recognized by importin alpha, which is bound by importin beta. Importin beta mediates translocation of the complex through the central channel of the nuclear pore, and upon reaching the nucleus, RanGTP binding to importin beta triggers disassembly of the complex. To date, six importin alpha family members, encoded by separate genes, have been described in humans."
24018270,HLA-F and MHC class I open conformers are ligands for NK cell Ig-like receptors.,"Killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs) are innate immune receptors expressed by NK and T cells classically associated with the detection of missing self through loss of their respective MHC ligand. Some KIR specificities for allelic classical class I MHC (MHC-I) have been described, whereas other KIR receptor-ligand relationships, including those associated with nonclassical MHC-I, have yet to be clearly defined. We report in this article that KIR3DL2 and KIR2DS4 and the nonclassical Ag HLA-F, expressed as a free form devoid of peptide, physically and functionally interact. These interactions extend to include classical MHC-I open conformers as ligands, defining new relationships between KIR receptors and MHC-I. The data collectively suggest a broader, previously unrecognized interaction between MHC-I open conformers--including prototypical HLA-F--and KIR receptors, acting in an immunoregulatory capacity centered on the inflammatory response."
12941889,The cap region of topoisomerase I binds to sites near both ends of simian virus 40 T antigen.,"Two independent binding sites on simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen for topoisomerase I (topo I) were identified. One was mapped to the N-terminal domain (residues 83 to 160) by a combination of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays performed with various T antigen deletion mutants. The second was mapped to the C-terminal domain (residues 602 to 708). The region in human topo I that binds to both sites in T antigen was identified by ELISAs, GST pull-down assays, and double-hexamer binding assays with topo I deletion mutants. This region corresponds to a distinct domain on topo I known as the cap region that maps from residues 175 to 433. By combining these data with information about the structure of T-antigen double hexamers associated with origin DNA, we propose that the cap region of topo I associates specifically with both ends of the double hexamer bound to the SV40 origin to initiate DNA replication."
9126318,The interaction between human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene 2 (IE2) protein and heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1.,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an ubiquitous pathogen which causes significant illness in immunocompromised individuals. The immediate-early gene 2 (IE2) protein of HCMV plays an important role in the regulation of virus replication. Previous studies have shown that the IE2 protein is able to interact with several cellular proteins, but many of the IE2 interacting partners remain unidentified. By utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system, the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) was identified as an IE2 interacting protein. The interaction was confirmed via the in vitro binding of bacterial expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST) IE2 fusion protein with the in vitro translated hnRNP A1. The mutational analysis showed that both the N-terminal half (1-290 residues) and C-terminal half (291-579 residues) of IE2 protein can interact with the hnRNP A1, indicating that more than one region of IE2 protein are involved in the binding with hnRNP A1."
15986874,NACA as a potential cellular target of hepatitis B virus preS1 protein.,"The mechanisms of the attachment and penetration of hepatitis B virus remain obscure. It has been demonstrated that the preS1 region is essential for viral assembly and infectivity, however, as its cellular receptor has still not been identified unequivocally, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen the cellular proteins that can interact with preS1 protein. The protein recovered from a human liver cDNA library was nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha polypeptide. The interaction between preS1 and nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha polypeptide was verified by mating experiment and coimmunoprecipitation of COS7 cell lysates expressing both proteins. Based on these results, we speculate that nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha polypeptide is a functional target of hepatitis B virus preS1 protein in cells."
10091999,A cellular protein which binds hepatitis B virus but not hepatitis B surface antigen.,"The envelope of hepatitis B virus (HBV) consists of three related proteins known as the large (L), middle (M) and small (S) hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg). L-HBsAg has a 108-119 amino acid extension at the N terminus compared with M-HBsAg and contains the preS1 sequence of the HBV envelope. Previous research has identified this region as the likely virus attachment protein which is thought to interact with the cellular receptor for the virus. However, as the receptor has still not been identified unequivocally, we used the preS1 region of L-HBsAg to screen a human liver cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system. Several positive clones were isolated which encoded cellular proteins that interacted with the HBV preS1 protein. The specificity was examined in an independent manner in experiments in which baculovirus-derived glutathione S-transferase (GST)-preS1 was incubated with 35S-labelled protein expressed by in vitro translation from the positive clones. The intensity of the interactions using this alternative approach mirrored those observed in the yeast two-hybrid system and two proteins (an unidentified protein and a mitochondrial protein) were selected for further study. The specificity of the binding reaction between the preS1 protein and these two proteins was further confirmed in a competition assay; HBV purified from serum, but not purified HBsAg, was able to compete with preS1 and thus block GST-preS1 binding to the unidentified protein but not to the mitochondrial protein. The unidentified protein was then expressed as a fusion protein with GST and this was able to bind HBV virions in a direct manner."
17109635,Protein encoded by HSV-1 stimulation-related gene 1 (HSRG1) interacts with and inhibits SV40 large T antigen.,Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 stimulation-related gene 1 (HSRG1) protein expression is induced in HSV-1 infected cells. We found that HSRG1 interacts with SV40 large T antigen (LT) in yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. This interaction alters LT's regulation of the SV40 promoter and its ability to influence the cell cycle. Choramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) assays revealed that initiation of gene transcription by LT is changed by HSRG1 expression. HSRG1 inhibits the ability of LT to activate SV40 late gene transcription. Further data indicate that the ability of LT protein to stimulate S-phase entry is also inhibited by the expression of HSRG1. The results of a colony-forming assay suggested that expression of HSRG1 in cells transfected by LT gene decreased the rate of colony formation. Yeast two-hybrid beta-galactosidase assay revealed that amino acid residues 132-450 in LT bind HSRG1.
1701947,"Immunological evidence for the association between simian virus 40 115-kDa super T antigen and hsp70 proteins in rat, monkey, and human cells.","Immunological evidence was provided that in subclone 7 cell line, which is derived from SV40 transformed cells, 115-kDa super T antigen, a transformation-competent, elongated form of large T antigen was physically complexed with hsp70 proteins. This conclusion was first based on the coimmunoprecipitation from unstressed or heat shocked subclone 7 cells of both super T antigen and hsp70 proteins. This was observed with any one of a set of anti-T monoclonal antibodies reacting to determinants located either in the C-terminal region or in the N terminal region. Reciprocally coimmunoprecipitation of both hsp70 and super T was also observed in the anti-hsp70 peptide serum-immunoprecipitate. The formation of complexes between hsp70 proteins and super T antigen in subclone 7 cells was also confirmed by Western blot experiments. Moreover, when expressed in cell lines originating from human (Hela cells) or monkey (CV1P cells) species following transfection with the relevant plasmid, super T antigen again displayed the ability to associate with hsp70 proteins. Considering that super T antigen was obtained in laboratory experiments as a stable evolutionary variant of SV40 large T antigen, it is suggested that the marked ability of super T antigen to associate with heat shock protein could be selectively advantageous under certain conditions."
8985331,p300 family members associate with the carboxyl terminus of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen.,"Several cellular polypeptides critical for growth regulation interact with DNA tumor virus oncoproteins. p400 is a cellular protein which binds to the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein(s). The biological function of p400 is not yet known, but it is structurally and immunologically closely related to p300 and CREB-binding protein, two known E1A-binding transcription adapters. Like p300, p400 is a phosphoprotein that binds to the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (T). In anti-T coimmunoprecipitation experiments, staggered deletions spanning the amino-terminal 250 amino acids of T did not abrogate T binding to either p400 or p300. A T species composed of residues 251 to 708 bound both p400 and p300, while a T species defective in p53 binding was unable to bind either detectably. Anti-p53 immunoprecipitates prepared from cells containing wild-type T also contained p400 and p300. Hence, both p400 and p300 can bind (directly or indirectly) to a carboxyl-terminal fragment of T which contains its p53 binding domain. Since the p53 binding domain of T contributes to its immortalizing and transforming activities, T-p400 and/or T-p300 interactions may participate in these functions."
28786561,Mapping the interactome of HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins with the ubiquitin-proteasome system.,"Protein ubiquitination and its reverse reaction, deubiquitination, regulate protein stability, protein binding activity, and their subcellular localization. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzymes E1, E2, and E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases and deubiquitinases (DUBs). The Ub-proteasome system (UPS) is targeted by viruses for the sake of their replication and to escape host immune response. To identify novel partners of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) E6 and E7 proteins, we assembled and screened a library of 590 cDNAs related to the UPS by using the Gaussia princeps luciferase protein complementation assay. HPV16 E6 was found to bind to the homology to E6AP C terminus-type Ub ligase (E6AP), three really interesting new gene (RING)-type Ub ligases (MGRN1, LNX3, LNX4), and the DUB Ub-specific protease 15 (USP15). Except for E6AP, the binding of UPS factors did not require the LxxLL-binding pocket of HPV16 E6. LNX3 bound preferentially to all high-risk mucosal HPV E6 tested, whereas LNX4 bound specifically to HPV16 E6. HPV16 E7 was found to bind to several broad-complex tramtrack and bric-a-brac domain-containing proteins (such as TNFAIP1/KCTD13) that are potential substrate adaptors of Cullin 3-RING Ub ligases, to RING-type Ub ligases implicated in innate immunity (RNF135, TRIM32, TRAF2, TRAF5), to the substrate adaptor DCAF15 of Cullin 4-RING Ub ligase and to some DUBs (USP29, USP33). The binding to UPS factors did not require the LxCxE motif but rather the C-terminal region of HPV16 E7 protein. The identified UPS factors interacted with most of E7 proteins across different HPV types. This study establishes a strategy for the rapid identification of interactions between host or pathogen proteins and the human ubiquitination system."
11437316,Human herpesvirus 8 viral FLICE-inhibitory protein inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis through binding and prevention of procaspase-8 maturation.,"Viral FLICE-inhibitory proteins (v-FLIPs) encoded by several herpesviruses and poxviruses share the ability to inhibit apoptosis after engagement of death receptors. In the current article, we provide insights into the mechanisms by which the v-FLIP of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (also referred to as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus) protects cells from apoptosis after Fas-induced signaling. Using v-FLIP expression vectors, our results clearly show that HHV-8 v-FLIP reduces the cleavage of procaspase-8 into its active p18 and p10 protease subunits upon Fas-induced cell death. These results were confirmed by lower caspase-8 and caspase-3 protease activities in extracts of HeLa cells expressing HHV-8 v-FLIP. Coimmunoprecipitation studies further indicate that HHV-8 v-FLIP physically interacts with procaspase-8, but not with Fas-associated protein with death domain in the cellular cytoplasm. These results suggest that binding of HHV-8 v-FLIP to procaspase-8 affects the recruitment and the activation of the latter at the death-induced signaling complex, resulting in diminished apoptotic cascade initiation. Because cellular FLIP was recently reported to modulate promoter containing NF-kappaB motifs and that both HHV-8 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HWV-1) can infect monocytes, we studied the effects of v-FLIP on HIV-1 gene expression. Cotransfection experiments indicated that v-FLIP expression is associated with activation of HIV long terminal repeats: events that were strictly dependent on the presence of NF-kappaB consensus elements. In conclusion, HHV-8 v-FLIP can possibly contribute to the pathogenesis of both HHV-8 and HIV-1 through impaired Fas-dependent killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells and through activation of HIV gene expression."
12697898,Chaperone action in the posttranslational topological reorientation of the hepatitis B virus large envelope protein: Implications for translocational regulation.,"The large L envelope protein of the hepatitis B virus utilizes a new folding pathway to acquire a dual transmembrane topology in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The process involves cotranslational membrane integration and subsequent posttranslational translocation of its preS subdomain into the ER. Here, we demonstrate that the conformational and functional heterogeneity of L depends on the action of molecular chaperones. Using coimmunoprecipitation, we observed specific interactions between L and the cytosolic Hsc70, in conjunction with Hsp40, and between L and the ER-resident BiP in mammalian cells. Complex formation between L and Hsc70 was abolished when preS translocation was artificially switched to a cotranslational mode, implicating Hsc70 to act as a preS holding and folding catalyst that controls partial preS posttranslocation. The functional role of Hsc70 in L topogenesis was confirmed through modulation of its in vivo activity by overexpressing its co-chaperones Hip and Bag-1. Overexpression of the Hsc70-stimulating molecule Hip led to increased entrapping of preS on the cytosolic ER face and hence to a decrease in preS posttranslocation, whereas the negative regulator Bag-1 had the opposite effects. Furthermore, Hip-mediated Hsc70 activation impaired virus production in hepatitis B virus-replicating hepatoma cells, likely due to the improper topological reorientation of L. Together, these results indicate that translocational regulation of protein topology by chaperones provides a means of generating structural and functional diversity. They also hint to the dynamic nature of the mammalian ER translocation machinery in handling co- and posttranslational substrates."
9300046,Sequence-specific repression of cotranslational translocation of the hepatitis B virus envelope proteins coincides with binding of heat shock protein Hsc70.,"The large L envelope protein of the hepatitis B virus has the peculiar capacity to adopt two transmembrane topologies. The N-terminal preS domain of L initially remains in the cytosol while the S domain is cotranslationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The preS region of about half of the L molecules' is posttranslationally translocated to the lumenal space. We now demonstrate that the repression of cotranslational translocation of preS is conferred by a preS1-specific sequence. By analysis of L deletion mutants, the cytosolic anchorage determinant was mapped to amino acid sequence 70 to 94 of L. The intrinsic potential of this determinant to suppress cotranslational translocation was confirmed by transfer to the HBV middle envelope protein. In searching for cellular factors potentially involved in this novel process, we identified the cytosolic heat shock protein Hsc70 as a specific binding partner of L. The interaction site(s) for the chaperone was mapped to amino acids 63 to 107 of L using coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding analyses. Deletion of the cytosolic anchorage determinant almost completely abolished ATP-dependent Hsc70 binding. Therefore, interaction between Hsc70 and L is likely to be responsible for the suppression of cotranslational translocation of the preS domain."
1310776,Simian virus 40 large T antigen stably complexes with a 185-kilodalton host protein.,"Stable interactions between simian virus 40 large T antigen and host proteins are believed to play a major role in the ability of the viral protein to transform cells in culture and induce tumors in vivo. Two of these host proteins, the retinoblastoma susceptibility protein (pRB) and p53, are products of tumor suppressor genes, suggesting that T antigen exerts at least a portion of its transforming activity by complexing with and inactivating the function of these proteins. While analyzing T antigen-host protein complexes in mouse cells, we noted a protein of 185 kDa (p185) which specifically coimmunoprecipitates with T antigen. Coimmunoprecipitation results from the formation of stable complexes between T antigen and p185. Complex formation is independent of the interactions of T antigen with pRB, p120, and p53. Furthermore, analysis of T-antigen mutants suggests that T antigen-p185 complex formation may be important in transformation by simian virus 40."
10617616,Requirement for a kinase-specific chaperone pathway in the production of a Cdk9/cyclin T1 heterodimer responsible for P-TEFb-mediated tat stimulation of HIV-1 transcription.,"Tat activation of HIV-1 transcription is mediated by human transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, which interacts with Tat and phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. The catalytic subunit of the P-TEFb complex, Cdk9, has been shown to interact with cyclin T and several other proteins of unknown identity. Consequently, the exact subunit composition of active P-TEFb has not been determined. Here we report the affinity purification and identification of the Cdk9-associated proteins. In addition to forming a heterodimer with cyclin T1, Cdk9 interacted with the molecular chaperone Hsp70 or a kinase-specific chaperone complex, Hsp90/Cdc37, to form two separate chaperone-Cdk9 complexes. Although the Cdk9/cyclin T1 dimer was exceptionally stable and produced slowly in the cell, free and unprotected Cdk9 appeared to be degraded rapidly. Several lines of evidence indicate the heterodimer of Cdk9/cyclin T1 to be the mature, active form of P-TEFb responsible for phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II interaction with the Tat activation domain, and mediation of Tat activation of HIV-1 transcription. Pharmacological inactivation of Hsp90/Cdc37 function by geldanamycin revealed an essential role for the chaperone-Cdk9 complexes in generation of Cdk9/cyclin T1. Our data suggest a previously unrecognized chaperone-dependent pathway involving the sequential actions of Hsp70 and Hsp90/Cdc37 in the stabilization/folding of Cdk9 as well as the assembly of an active Cdk9/cyclin T1 complex responsible for P-TEFb-mediated Tat transactivation."
7853496,"Lentivirus Tat proteins specifically associate with a cellular protein kinase, TAK, that hyperphosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II: candidate for a Tat cofactor.","Efficient replication of human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) requires the virus transactivator proteins known as Tat. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in Tat transactivation, it is essential to identify the cellular target(s) of the Tat activation domain. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we previously identified a cellular protein kinase activity, Tat-associated kinase (TAK), that specifically binds to the activation domains of Tat proteins. Here it is demonstrated that TAK fulfills the genetic criteria established for a Tat cofactor. TAK binds in vitro to the activation domains of the Tat proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 and the distantly related lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus but not to mutant Tat proteins that contain nonfunctional activation domains. In addition, it is shown that TAK is sensitive to dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, a nucleoside analog that inhibits a limited number of kinases and is known to inhibit Tat transactivation in vivo and in vitro. We have further identified an in vitro substrate of TAK, the carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain has been proposed to trigger the transition from initiation to active elongation and also to influence later stages during elongation. Taken together, these results imply that TAK is a very promising candidate for a cellular factor that mediates Tat transactivation."
9356449,"TAK, an HIV Tat-associated kinase, is a member of the cyclin-dependent family of protein kinases and is induced by activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and differentiation of promonocytic cell lines.","We have previously identified a cellular protein kinase activity termed TAK that specifically associates with the HIV types 1 and 2 Tat proteins. TAK hyperphosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II in vitro in a manner believed to activate transcription [Herrmann, C. H. & Rice, A. P. (1995) J. Virol. 69, 1612-1620]. We show here that the catalytic subunit of TAK is a known human kinase previously named PITALRE, which is a member of the cyclin-dependent family of proteins. We also show that TAK activity is elevated upon activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes and upon differentiation of U1 and U937 promonocytic cell lines to macrophages. Therefore, in HIV-infected individuals TAK may be induced in T cells following activation and in macrophages following differentiation, thus contributing to high levels of viral transcription and the escape from latency of transcriptionally silent proviruses."
10364375,Simian immunodeficiency virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nef proteins show distinct patterns and mechanisms of Src kinase activation.,"The nef gene from human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV) regulates cell function and viral replication, possibly through binding of the nef product to cellular proteins, including Src family tyrosine kinases. We show here that the Nef protein encoded by SIVmac239 interacts with and also activates the human Src kinases Lck and Hck. This is in direct contrast to the inhibitory effect of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) Nef on Lck catalytic activity. Unexpectedly, however, the interaction of SIV Nef with human Lck or Hck is not mediated via its consensus proline motif, which is known to mediate HIV-1 Nef binding to Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, and various experimental analyses failed to show significant interaction of SIV Nef with the SH3 domain of either kinase. Instead, SIV Nef can bind Lck and Hck SH2 domains, and its N-terminal 50 amino acid residues are sufficient for Src kinase binding and activation. Our results provide evidence for multiple mechanisms by which Nef binds to and regulates Src kinases."
16987978,The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded LMP-1 oncoprotein negatively affects Tyk2 phosphorylation and interferon signaling in human B cells.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes a persistent infection in the human host and is associated with a variety of human cancers. Persistent infection results from a balance between the host immune response and viral immune evasion mechanisms. EBV infection is controlled initially by the innate immune response and later by T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity. EBV has evolved mechanisms to evade the host immune response so that it can persist for the lifetime of the host. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) is the EBV oncoprotein essential for B-cell immortalization by EBV. We show here that LMP-1 interacts with Tyk2, a signaling intermediate in the alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) signaling pathway, via a previously uncharacterized LMP-1 signaling domain. LMP-1 prevents Tyk2 phosphorylation and inhibits IFN-alpha-stimulated STAT2 nuclear translocation and interferon-stimulated response element transcriptional activity. Long-term culture of EBV+ lymphoblastoid cells in IFN-alpha is associated with outgrowth of a population expressing elevated LMP-1 protein levels, suggesting that cells expressing higher levels of LMP-1 survive the antiproliferative selective pressure imposed by IFN-alpha. These results show that LMP-1 can protect EBV+ cells from the IFN-alpha-stimulated antiviral/antiproliferative response and suggest that chronic IFN-alpha treatment may encourage the outgrowth of cells expressing elevated, and therefore potentially oncogenic, LMP-1 levels in EBV+ individuals."
26053890,Quantifying domain-ligand affinities and specificities by high-throughput holdup assay.,"Many protein interactions are mediated by small linear motifs interacting specifically with defined families of globular domains. Quantifying the specificity of a motif requires measuring and comparing its binding affinities to all its putative target domains. To this end, we developed the high-throughput holdup assay, a chromatographic approach that can measure up to 1,000 domain-motif equilibrium binding affinities per day. After benchmarking the approach on 210 PDZ-peptide pairs with known affinities, we determined the affinities of two viral PDZ-binding motifs derived from human papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins for 209 PDZ domains covering 79% of the human 'PDZome'. We obtained sharply sequence-dependent binding profiles that quantitatively describe the PDZome recognition specificity of each motif. This approach, applicable to many categories of domain-ligand interactions, has wide potential for quantifying the specificities of interactomes."
12636258,Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP) forms complexes with a cellular anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 or its EBV counterpart BHRF1 through HS1-associated protein X-1.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP) plays a critical role in EBV-induced transformation. An earlier report (Y. Kawaguchi et al., J. Virol. 74: 10104-10111, 2000) showed that EBNA-LP interacts with a cellular protein HS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1). The predicted amino acid sequence of HAX-1 exhibits similarity to that of another cellular protein Nip3 which has been shown to interact with cellular and viral anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and BHRF1, an EBV homolog of Bcl-2. Here we investigated whether HAX-1, like Nip3, interacts with Bcl-2 proteins and report the following. (i) A purified chimeric protein consisting of gluthathione S-transferase (GST) fused to BHRF1 (GST-BHRF1) or Bcl-2 (GST-Bcl-2) specifically pulled down HAX-1 transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. (ii) GST-BHRF1 or GST-Bcl-2 was not able to pull down EBNA-LP transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, whereas each of the GST fusion proteins formed complexes with EBNA-LP in the presence of RAX-1. These results indicated that EBNA-LP interacts with the viral and cellular Bcl-2 proteins through HAX-1, suggesting that EBNA-LP possesses a potential function in the regulation of apoptosis in EBV-infected cells."
7478623,"Bik, a novel death-inducing protein shares a distinct sequence motif with Bcl-2 family proteins and interacts with viral and cellular survival-promoting proteins.","The survival-promoting activity of the Bcl-2 family of proteins appears to be modulated by interactions between various cellular proteins. We have identified a novel cellular protein, Bik, that interacts with the cellular survival-promoting proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, as well as the viral survival-promoting proteins, Epstein Barr virus-BHRF1 and adenovirus E1B-19 kDa. In transient transfection assays, Bik promotes cell death in a manner similar to the death-promoting members of the Bcl-2 family, Bax and Bak. This death-promoting activity of Bik can be suppressed by coexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, EBV-BHRF1 and E1B-19 kDa proteins suggesting that Bik may be a common target for both cellular and viral anti-apoptotic proteins. While Bik does not show overt homology to the BH1 and BH2 conserved domains characteristic of the Bcl-2 family, it does share a 9 amino acid domain (BH3) with Bax and Bak which may be a critical determinant for the death-promoting activity of these proteins."
24945353,Recruitment of RED-SMU1 complex by Influenza A Virus RNA polymerase to control Viral mRNA splicing.,"Influenza A viruses are major pathogens in humans and in animals, whose genome consists of eight single-stranded RNA segments of negative polarity. Viral mRNAs are synthesized by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in the nucleus of infected cells, in close association with the cellular transcriptional machinery. Two proteins essential for viral multiplication, the exportin NS2/NEP and the ion channel protein M2, are produced by splicing of the NS1 and M1 mRNAs, respectively. Here we identify two human spliceosomal factors, RED and SMU1, that control the expression of NS2/NEP and are required for efficient viral multiplication. We provide several lines of evidence that in infected cells, the hetero-trimeric viral polymerase recruits a complex formed by RED and SMU1 through interaction with its PB2 and PB1 subunits. We demonstrate that the splicing of the NS1 viral mRNA is specifically affected in cells depleted of RED or SMU1, leading to a decreased production of the spliced mRNA species NS2, and to a reduced NS2/NS1 protein ratio. In agreement with the exportin function of NS2, these defects impair the transport of newly synthesized viral ribonucleoproteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and strongly reduce the production of infectious influenza virions. Overall, our results unravel a new mechanism of viral subversion of the cellular splicing machinery, by establishing that the human splicing factors RED and SMU1 act jointly as key regulators of influenza virus gene expression. In addition, our data point to a central role of the viral RNA polymerase in coupling transcription and alternative splicing of the viral mRNAs."
19671663,Simian virus 40 large T antigen targets the microtubule-stabilizing protein TACC2.,"The large T antigens of polyomaviruses target cellular proteins that control fundamental processes, including p53 and the RB family of tumor suppressors. Mechanisms that underlie T-antigen-induced cell transformation need to be fully addressed, because as-yet unidentified target proteins might be involved in the process. In addition, recently identified polyomaviruses are associated with particular human diseases such as aggressive skin cancers. Here, we report that simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen interacts with the transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein TACC2, which is involved in stabilizing microtubules in mitosis. T antigen directly binds TACC2 and induces microtubule dysfunction, leading to disorganized mitotic spindles, slow progression of mitosis and chromosome missegregation. These mitotic defects are caused by N-terminal-deleted T antigen, which minimally interacts with TACC2, whereas T-antigen-induced microtubule destabilization is suppressed by overexpressing TACC2. Thus, TACC2 might be a key target of T antigen to disrupt microtubule regulation and chromosomal inheritance in the initiation of cell transformation."
12702563,Molecular imaging of protein-protein interactions: controlled expression of p53 and large T-antigen fusion proteins in vivo.,"Protein-protein interactions control essential steps in signal transduction pathways and other intracellular processes, and assembly of protein complexes modulates and responds to the regulatory events that exist in living animals. We have used microPET and fluorescence imaging to detect interactions between p53 tumor suppressor and large T antigen (TAg) of SV40 virus in a tetracycline-inducible two-hybrid system. To additionally validate this molecular imaging technique, we investigated whether expression of the reporter gene, comprised of a mutant thymidine kinase from herpes simplex virus 1 fused to green fluorescent protein could quantify relative differences in amounts of interacting hybrid proteins. In HeLa cells stably transfected with the reporter gene and interacting (p53-TAg) or noninteracting (p53 and polyoma virus coat protein) pairs of proteins, treatment with doxycycline produced time- and dose-dependent increases in expression of hybrid proteins. Proportional increases in amounts of reporter gene were produced only in cells expressing p53 and TAg. In mice bearing xenografts of these stably transfected HeLa cells, amounts of hybrid proteins were regulated with doxycycline. Both microPET imaging and biodistribution studies showed time- and dose-dependent increases in accumulation of the reporter substrate 9-(4-[(18)F]-fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl)guanine only in p53-TAg tumors. Fluorescence microscopy of excised tumors also showed corresponding changes in expression of the fusion reporter gene in response to binding of p53 and TAg. These data demonstrate that the imaging two-hybrid system responds in a proportional fashion to increasing amounts of interacting proteins in vivo."
9624170,Binding of c-Raf1 kinase to a conserved acidic sequence within the carboxyl-terminal region of the HIV-1 Nef protein.,"Nef is a membrane-associated cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that is well conserved among the different human (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency viruses and has important roles in down-regulating the CD4 receptor and modulating T-cell signaling pathways. The ability to modulate T-cell signaling pathways suggests that Nef may physically interact with T-cell signaling proteins. In order to identify Nef binding proteins and map their site(s) of interaction, we targeted a highly conserved acidic sequence at the carboxyl-terminal region of Nef sharing striking similarity with an acidic sequence at the c-Raf1-binding site within the Ras effector region. Here, we used deletion and site-specific mutagenesis to generate mutant Nef proteins fused to bacterial glutathione S-transferase in in vitro precipitation assays and immunoblot analysis to map the specific interaction between the HIV-1LAI Nef and c-Raf1 to a conserved acidic sequence motif containing the core sequence Asp-Asp-X-X-X-Glu (position 174-179). Significantly, we demonstrate that substitution of the nonpolar glycine residue for either or both of the conserved negatively charged aspartic acid residues at positions 174 and 175 in the full-length recombinant Nef protein background completely abrogated binding of c-Raf1 in vitro. In addition, lysates from a permanent CEM T-cell line constitutively expressing the native HIV-1 Nef protein was used to coimmunoprecipitate a stable Nef-c-Raf1 complex, suggesting that molecular interactions between Nef and c-Raf1, an important downstream transducer of cell signaling through the c-Raf1-MAP kinase pathway, occur in vivo. This interaction may account for the Nef-induced perturbations of T-cell signaling and activation pathways in vitro and in vivo."
11861836,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef binds to tumor suppressor p53 and protects cells against p53-mediated apoptosis.,"The nef gene product of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is important for the induction of AIDS, and key to its function is its ability to manipulate T-cell function by targeting cellular signal transduction proteins. We reported that Nef coprecipitates a multiprotein complex from cells which contains tumor suppressor protein p53. We now show that Nef interacts directly with p53. Binding assays showed that an N-terminal, 57-residue fragment of Nef (Nef 1-57) contains the p53-binding domain. Nef also interacted with p53 during HIV-1 infection in vitro. As p53 plays a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis, we hypothesized that Nef may alter this process. Nef inhibited UV light-induced, p53-dependent apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells, with Nef 1-57 being as effective as its full-length counterpart. The inhibition by Nef of p53 apoptotic function is most likely due its observed ability to decrease p53 protein half-life and, consequently, p53 DNA binding activity and transcriptional activation. These data show that HIV-1 Nef may augment HIV replication by prolonging the viability of infected cells by blocking p53-mediated apoptosis."
8626429,Physical and functional interaction of Nef with Lck. HIV-1 Nef-induced T-cell signaling defects.,"The nef gene is unique to the primate lentiviruses and encodes a cytoplasmic membrane-associated protein that affects T-cell signaling and is essential for both maintenance of a high virus load in vivo and for disease progression. Here we investigated the perturbation of cell signaling by Nef in T-cells and found that Nef interacts with the T-cell restricted Lek tyrosine kinase both in vitro and in vivo. The molecular basis for this interaction was analyzed. We show that cell-derived Nef is precipitated in a synergistic manner by the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains from Lck. A functional proline-rich motif and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Nef were evidenced as likely participants in this interaction. The precipitation of Nef by the Lck recombinant proteins was specific, since neither Fyn, Csk, p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase nor phospholipase Cgamma SH2 domains coprecipitated Nef from T-cells. Finally, depressed Lck kinase activity resulted from the presence of Nef, both in vitro and in intact cells, and nef expression resulted in impairment of both proximal and distal Lck-mediated signaling events. These results provide a molecular basis for the Nef-induced T-cell signaling defect and its role in AIDS pathogenesis."
8794306,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef binds directly to Lck and mitogen-activated protein kinase, inhibiting kinase activity.","It is now well established that human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) Nef contributes substantially to disease pathogenesis by augmenting virus replication and markedly perturbing T-cell function. The effect of Nef on host cell activation could be explained in part by its interaction with specific cellular proteins involved in signal transduction, including at least a member of the src family kinase, Lck, and the serine/threonine kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Recombinant Nef directly interacted with purified Lck and MAPK in coprecipitation experiments and binding assays. A proline-rich repeat sequence [(Pxx)4] in Nef occurring between amino acid residues 69 to 78 is highly conserved and bears strong resemblance to a defined consensus sequence identified as an SH3 binding domain present in several proteins which can interact with the SH3 domain of various signalling and cytoskeletal proteins. Binding and coprecipitation assays with short synthetic peptides corresponding to the proline-rich repeat sequence [(Pxx)4] of Nef and the SH2, SH3, or SH2 and SH3 domains of Lck revealed that the interaction between these two proteins is at least in part mediated by the proline repeat sequence of Nef and the SH3 domain of Lck. In addition to direct binding to full-length Nef, MAPK was also shown to bind the same proline repeat motif. Nef protein significantly decreased the in vitro kinase activity of Lck and MAPK. Inhibition of key members of signalling cascades, including those emanating from the T-cell receptor, by the HIV-1 Nef protein undoubtedly alters the ability of the infected T cell to respond to antigens or cytokines, facilitating HIV-1 replication and contributing to HIV-1-induced disease pathogenesis."
9705913,The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein binds the Src-related tyrosine kinase Lck SH2 domain through a novel phosphotyrosine independent mechanism.,"Primate lentiviruses encode for an unique nef gene with an essential function in both viral replication and pathogenicity in the host. The molecular basis for this function remains however poorly defined. Several Nef-binding cellular proteins are thought to be instrumental in its function. Indeed, Nef contains a proline-rich motif implicated in the binding to the Src-like tyrosine kinase Hck and also to a Ser/Thr kinase of molecular weight 62 kDa. The disruption of this motif affects the binding to both these kinases as well as viral replication. Whereas Hck is expressed in the myeloid lineage and hence may account for the nef function in infected monocytes, we and others have reported previously that Nef also interacts with the T-lymphocyte Src-kinase Lck, leading to specific cell signaling impairment. This interaction occurs through the binding of Nef to both Lck SH2 and SH3 domains. Both the proline motif and phosphorylation of Nef on tyrosine residue were proposed to account for these interactions. Here, we investigate the mechanism of Lck SH2 binding by HIV-1 Nef. Using recombinant fusion proteins to precipitate lysates, we show that although SH2 binding is dependent on phosphorylation events, it occurs in a tyrosine independent manner because it requires neither tyrosine residues in Nef nor the phosphotyrosine binding pocket from the Lck SH2 domain, hence suggesting a role for a phosphoserine or a phosphothreonine residue. Further, we show that Hck SH2 does not interact with Nef, indicating that Hck SH3 binding is sufficient for Nef binding, whereas Lck SH2 cooperate together with SH3 to allow Nef binding to a level similar to Hck SH3. Together, our results establish different mechanisms for Hck and Lck binding by HIV-1 Nef protein, and identify a novel mechanism for Src-like tyrosine kinase targeting by a viral protein."
10713183,p21-activated kinase 1 plays a critical role in cellular activation by Nef.,"The activation of Nef-associated kinase (NAK) by Nef from human and simian immunodeficiency viruses is critical for efficient viral replication and pathogenesis. This induction occurs via the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav and the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. In this study, we identified NAK as p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). PAK1 bound to Nef in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the induction of cytoskeletal rearrangements such as the formation of trichopodia, the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase, and the increase of viral production were blocked by an inhibitory peptide that targets the kinase activity of PAK1 (PAK1 83-149). These results identify NAK as PAK1 and emphasize the central role its kinase activity plays in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cellular signaling by Nef."
10707087,HIV-1 Nef protein binds to the cellular protein PACS-1 to downregulate class I major histocompatibility complexes.,"Major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) proteins are used to display, on the surface of a cell, peptides derived from foreign material - such as a virus - that is infecting that cell. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes then recognize and kill the infected cell. The HIV-1 Nef protein downregulates the cell-surface expression of class I MHC proteins, and probably thereby promotes immune evasion by HIV-1. In the presence of Nef, class I MHC molecules are relocalized from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) through as-yet-unknown mechanisms. Here we show that Nef-induced downregulation of MHC-I expression and MHC-I targeting to the TGN require the binding of Nef to PACS-1, a molecule that controls the TGN localization of the cellular protein furin. This interaction is dependent on Nef's cluster of acidic amino acids. A chimaeric integral membrane protein containing Nef as its cytoplasmic domain localizes to the TGN after internalization, in an acidic-cluster- and PACS-1-dependent manner. These results support a model in which Nef relocalizes MHC-I by acting as a connector between MHC-I's cytoplasmic tail and the PACS-1-dependent protein-sorting pathway."
12032142,Subunit H of the V-ATPase binds to the medium chain of adaptor protein complex 2 and connects Nef to the endocytic machinery.,"Nef is an accessory protein of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV) that is required for efficient viral infectivity and pathogenicity. It decreases the expression of CD4 on the surface of infected cells. V1H is the regulatory subunit H of the vacuolar membrane ATPase (V-ATPase). Previously, the interaction between Nef and V1H has been found to facilitate the internalization of CD4, suggesting that V1H could connect Nef to the endocytic machinery. In this study, we demonstrate that V1H binds to the C-terminal flexible loop in Nef from HIV-1 and to the medium chain (mu2) of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) in vitro and in vivo. The interaction sites of V1H and mu2 were mapped to a central region in V1H from positions 133 to 363, which contains 4 armadillo repeats, and to the N-terminal adaptin-binding domain in mu2 from positions 1 to 145. Fusing Nef to V1H reproduced the appropriate trafficking of Nef. This chimera internalized CD4 even in the absence of the C-terminal flexible loop in Nef. Finally, blocking the expression of V1H decreased the enhancement of virion infectivity by Nef. Thus, V1H can function as an adaptor for interactions between Nef and AP-2."
7818536,A novel approach to protein-protein interaction: complex formation between the p53 tumor suppressor and the HIV Tat proteins.,"By using a novel genetic approach, based on the properties of lambda cl repressor, we demonstrate that the HIV-1 Tat protein specifically interacts with the human p53 protein via the p53 O2 dimerization domain. By random and site-specific mutagenesis, we also identify the residues in Tat and O2 peptides which are involved in this interaction. Two alternative biological consequences are expected to result from Tat-p53 interaction: (i) Tat-O2 interaction inactivates p53 regulation function, thus producing cell transformation; (ii) Tat-O2 interaction favours the formation of p53 dimers, thus leading the cell towards apoptosis."
9094689,Protein B23 is an important human factor for the nucleolar localization of the human immunodeficiency virus protein Tat.,"Nucleolar shuttle protein B23 was found to bind to human immunodeficiency virus protein Tat, and this binding required the nucleolar localization motif of Tat. A fusion protein containing the B23 binding domain and beta-galactosidase caused mislocalization of Tat to the cytoplasm and inhibited the transactivation activity of Tat. These data suggest that B23 is a human factor necessary for the nucleolar localization of Tat."
10405328,HIV-1 Tat protein is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in vitro.,"Purified recombinant HIV-1 Tat protein stimulated acceptor-dependent reaction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of the reaction products by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with anti-poly(ADP-ribose) antibody revealed that recombinant Tat proteins were covalently modified with poly(ADP-ribose) in the enzyme reaction. Eventhough no significant effect of the modification was detected in the activity of Tat to form a specific complex with TAR (a viral transactivation response element) RNA, the present results raise the possibility that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is involved in the regulation of HIV-1 through the modification of a virus-encoded transactivator, Tat protein."
12758167,Regulation of MCP-1 gene transcription by Smads and HIV-1 Tat in human glial cells.,"Expression of several cytokines involved in signal transduction such as TGFbeta-1 and the inflammatory chemokines including MCP-1 is elevated during the course of AIDS progression. The enhancement of these cellular proteins in astrocytic cells is mediated, at least in part, by HIV-1 Tat protein. Here, we investigate the possible regulation of MCP-1 transcription by Tat and the Smad family of transcription factors whose activities are induced by the TGFbeta-1 pathway. Results from transfection studies revealed that Smad-3 stimulates basal and Tat-mediated transcription of MCP-1 in human astrocytic cells. Smad-4, on the other hand, had no effect on the basal activity of the MCP-1 promoter, but showed the ability to decrease both Smad-3 and Tat-induced transcription of the MCP promoter. Results from protein-binding studies revealed the ability of both Smad-3 and Smad-4 to associate with the region of Tat spanning residues 1-40. Examination of the transcriptional activity of the various domains of Smad including MH1, at the N-terminus, and MH2, at the C-terminus of the protein indicated that neither MH1 or MH2 alone positively cooperate with Tat in modulating MCP-1 transcription. However, ectopic expression of MH1 and, more notably, MH2 severely suppressed transcriptional activation of MCP-1 by Tat in astrocytic cells. Binding studies revealed that similar to the full-length Smad protein, both MH1 and MH2 associate with Tat protein and that the residues between 1 and 40 of Tat are important for their interaction. These observations reveal a novel mechanism for Tat-mediated transcriptional activation via TGFbeta signaling pathway and provide evidence for regulation of MCP-1 gene transcription by this signaling pathway in human astrocytic cells."
10393559,"Control of the histone-acetyltransferase activity of Tip60 by the HIV-1 transactivator protein, Tat.","Tip60, a cellular histone-acetyltransferase, is known to interact with the HIV-1-encoded transactivator protein, Tat. In this work, we show that the interaction of Tat with Tip60 efficiently inhibits the Tip60 histone-acetyltransferase activity. Besides its histone-acetyltransferase activity, Tip60 can undergo an autoacetylation which is not affected by Tat interaction. Our data show that Tip60 does not significantly influence Tat-dependent transcriptional activation of the 5'-LTR of HIV, suggesting that its interaction with Tat affects some intrinsic cellular process. We were then able to identify a cellular gene, Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), that has a Tip60-dependent transcriptional activity. Interestingly, the simultaneous expression of Tat and Tip60 abolishes the effect of Tip60 on the activity of the Mn-SOD promoter. We postulate that the HIV-1 transactivator, Tat, in targeting Tip60 hinders the expression of cellular genes (such as Mn-SOD) which normally interfere with the efficient replication and propagation of the virus."
11997447,Noninvasive imaging of protein-protein interactions in living animals.,"Protein-protein interactions control transcription, cell division, and cell proliferation as well as mediate signal transduction, oncogenic transformation, and regulation of cell death. Although a variety of methods have been used to investigate protein interactions in vitro and in cultured cells, none can analyze these interactions in intact, living animals. To enable noninvasive molecular imaging of protein-protein interactions in vivo by positron-emission tomography and fluorescence imaging, we engineered a fusion reporter gene comprising a mutant herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase and green fluorescent protein for readout of a tetracycline-inducible, two-hybrid system in vivo. By using micro-positron-emission tomography, interactions between p53 tumor suppressor and the large T antigen of simian virus 40 were visualized in tumor xenografts of HeLa cells stably transfected with the imaging constructs. Imaging protein-binding partners in vivo will enable functional proteomics in whole animals and provide a tool for screening compounds targeted to specific protein-protein interactions in living animals."
15857993,Nuclear localization of the Nipah virus W protein allows for inhibition of both virus- and toll-like receptor 3-triggered signaling pathways.,"The Nipah virus V and W proteins, which are encoded by the P gene via RNA editing, have a common N-terminal domain but unique C-terminal domains. They localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, and have both been shown to function as inhibitors of JAK/STAT signaling. Here we report that V and W proteins also block virus activation of the beta interferon (IFN-beta) promoter and the IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-responsive IFN-stimulated gene 54 promoter. Surprisingly, only W protein shows strong inhibition of promoter activation in response to stimulation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) by extracellular double-stranded RNA. This activity is dependent on the nuclear localization of W protein. Within the unique C-terminal domain of W protein, we have identified a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that requires basic residues at positions 439, 440, and 442. This NLS is responsible for mediating the preferential interaction of W protein with karyopherin-alpha 3 and karyopherin-alpha 4. Nuclear localization of W protein therefore enables it to target both virus and TLR3 pathways, whereas the cytoplasmic V protein is restricted to inhibiting the virus pathway. We propose that this discrepancy is in part due to the V protein being less able to block signaling in response to the kinase, TBK-1, whereas both V and W can prevent promoter activation in response to IKKepsilon. We demonstrate that, when the TLR3 pathway is stimulated, the levels of phosphorylated IRF3 are reduced in the presence of W protein but not V protein, confirming the differential effects of these proteins and illustrating that W protein-mediated inhibition is due to a loss of active IRF3."
26438063,"Fibronectin-, vitronectin- and laminin-binding proteins at the cell walls of Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis pathogenic yeasts.","Candida parapsilosis and C. tropicalis increasingly compete with C. albicans-the most common fungal pathogen in humans-as causative agents of severe candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. In contrast to C. albicans, the pathogenic mechanisms of these two non-albicans Candida species are poorly understood. Adhesion of Candida yeast to host cells and the extracellular matrix is critical for fungal invasion of hosts."
27822540,Identification of Novel Host Interactors of Effectors Secreted by ,Many pathogenic bacteria of the family 
20855515,"EseG, an effector of the type III secretion system of Edwardsiella tarda, triggers microtubule destabilization.","Edwardsiella tarda is a Gram-negative enteric pathogen that causes hemorrhagic septicemia in fish and both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal infections in humans. A type III secretion system (T3SS) was recently shown to contribute to pathogenesis, since deletions of various T3SS genes increased the 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) by about 1 log unit in the blue gourami infection model. In this study, we report EseG as the first identified effector protein of T3SS. EseG shares partial homology with two Salmonella T3SS effectors (SseG and SseF) over a conserved domain (amino acid residues 142 to 192). The secretion of EseG is dependent on a functional T3SS and, in particular, requires the chaperone EscB. Experiments using TEM-1 β-lactamase as a fluorescence-based reporter showed that EseG was translocated into HeLa cells at 35°C. Fractionation of infected HeLa cells demonstrated that EseG was localized to the host membrane fraction after translocation. EseG is able to disassemble microtubule structures when overexpressed in mammalian cells. This phenotype may require a conserved motif of EseG (EseG(142-192)), since truncated versions of EseG devoid of this motif lose their ability to cause microtubule destabilization. By demonstrating the function of EseG, our study contributes to the understanding of E. tarda pathogenesis. Moreover, the approach established in this study to identify type III effectors can be used to identify and characterize more type III and possible type VI effectors in Edwardsiella."
18802093,The varicellovirus UL49.5 protein blocks the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) by inhibiting essential conformational transitions in the 6+6 transmembrane TAP core complex.,"TAP translocates virus-derived peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum, where the peptides are loaded onto MHC class I molecules. This process is crucial for the detection of virus-infected cells by CTL that recognize the MHC class I-peptide complexes at the cell surface. The varicellovirus bovine herpesvirus 1 encodes a protein, UL49.5, that acts as a potent inhibitor of TAP. UL49.5 acts in two ways, as follows: 1) by blocking conformational changes of TAP required for the translocation of peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, and 2) by targeting TAP1 and TAP2 for proteasomal degradation. At present, it is unknown whether UL49.5 interacts with TAP1, TAP2, or both. The contribution of other members of the peptide-loading complex has not been established. Using TAP-deficient cells reconstituted with wild-type and recombinant forms of TAP1 and TAP2, TAP was defined as the prime target of UL49.5 within the peptide-loading complex. The presence of TAP1 and TAP2 was required for efficient interaction with UL49.5. Using deletion mutants of TAP1 and TAP2, the 6+6 transmembrane core complex of TAP was shown to be sufficient for UL49.5 to interact with TAP and block its function. However, UL49.5-induced inhibition of peptide transport was most efficient in cells expressing full-length TAP1 and TAP2. Inhibition of TAP by UL49.5 appeared to be independent of the presence of other peptide-loading complex components, including tapasin. These results demonstrate that UL49.5 acts directly on the 6+6 transmembrane TAP core complex of TAP by blocking essential conformational transitions required for peptide transport."
15629770,Respiratory syncytial virus M2-1 protein induces the activation of nuclear factor kappa B.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induces the production of a number of cytokines and chemokines by activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). The activation of NF-kappaB has been shown to depend on viral replication in the infected cells. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of RSV M2-1 protein, a transcriptional processivity and anti-termination factor, is sufficient to activate NF-kappaB in A549 cells. Electromobility shift assays show increased NF-kappaB complexes in the nuclei of M2-1-expressing cells. M2-1 protein is found in nuclei of M2-1-expressing cells and in RSV-infected cells. Co-immunoprecipitations of nuclear extracts of M2-1-expressing cells and of RSV-infected cells revealed an association of M2-1 with Rel A protein. Furthermore, the activation of NF-kappaB depends on the C-terminus of the RSV M2-1 protein, as shown by NF-kappaB-induced gene expression of a reporter gene construct."
25686249,ATG12-ATG3 interacts with Alix to promote basal autophagic flux and late endosome function.,"The ubiquitin-like molecule ATG12 is required for the early steps of autophagy. Recently, we identified ATG3, the E2-like enzyme required for LC3 lipidation during autophagy, as an ATG12 conjugation target. Here, we demonstrate that cells lacking ATG12-ATG3 have impaired basal autophagic flux, accumulation of perinuclear late endosomes, and impaired endolysosomal trafficking. Furthermore, we identify an interaction between ATG12-ATG3 and the ESCRT-associated protein Alix (also known as PDCD6IP) and demonstrate that ATG12-ATG3 controls multiple Alix-dependent processes including late endosome distribution, exosome biogenesis and viral budding. Similar to ATG12-ATG3, Alix is functionally required for efficient basal, but not starvation-induced, autophagy. Overall, these results identify a link between the core autophagy and ESCRT machineries and uncover a role for ATG12-ATG3 in late endosome function that is distinct from the canonical role of either ATG in autophagosome formation."
21994459,Promyelocytic leukemia isoform IV confers resistance to encephalomyocarditis virus via the sequestration of 3D polymerase in nuclear bodies.,"Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is the organizer of nuclear matrix-associated nuclear bodies (NBs), and its conjugation to the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is required for the formation of these structures. Several alternatively spliced PML transcripts from a single PML gene lead to the production of seven PML isoforms (PML isoform I [PMLI] to VII [PMLVII]), which all share a N-terminal region that includes the RBCC (RING, B boxes, and a α-helical coiled-coil) motif but differ in the C-terminal region. This diversity of PML isoforms determines the specific functions of each isoform. There is increasing evidence implicating PML in host antiviral defense and suggesting various strategies involving PML to counteract viral production. We reported that mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from PML knockout mice are more sensitive than wild-type cells to infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Here, we show that stable expression of PMLIV or PMLIVa inhibited viral replication and protein synthesis, leading to a substantial reduction of EMCV multiplication. This protective effect required PMLIV SUMOylation and was not observed with other nuclear PML isoforms (I, II, III, V, and VI) or with the cytoplasmic PMLVII. We demonstrated that only PMLIV interacted with EMCV 3D polymerase (3Dpol) and sequestered it within PML NBs. The C-terminal region specific to PMLIV was required for both interaction with 3Dpol and the antiviral properties. Also, depletion of PMLIV by RNA interference significantly boosted EMCV production in interferon-treated cells. These findings indicate the mechanism by which PML confers resistance to EMCV. They also reveal a new pathway mediating the antiviral activity of interferon against EMCV."
23576498,Foot-and-mouth disease virus modulates cellular vimentin for virus survival.,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), the causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease, is an Aphthovirus within the Picornaviridae family. During infection with FMDV, several host cell membrane rearrangements occur to form sites of viral replication. FMDV protein 2C is part of the replication complex and thought to have multiple roles during virus replication. To better understand the role of 2C in the process of virus replication, we have been using a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify host proteins that interact with 2C. We recently reported that cellular Beclin1 is a natural ligand of 2C and that it is involved in the autophagy pathway, which was shown to be important for FMDV replication. Here, we report that cellular vimentin is also a specific host binding partner for 2C. The 2C-vimentin interaction was further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining to occur in FMDV-infected cells. It was shown that upon infection a vimentin structure forms around 2C and that this structure is later resolved or disappears. Interestingly, overexpression of vimentin had no effect on virus replication; however, overexpression of a truncated dominant-negative form of vimentin resulted in a significant decrease in viral yield. Acrylamide, which causes disruption of vimentin filaments, also inhibited viral yield. Alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to map the specific amino acid residues in 2C critical for vimentin binding. Using reverse genetics, we identified 2C residues that are necessary for virus growth, suggesting that the interaction between FMDV 2C and cellular vimentin is essential for virus replication."
23197835,Autophagosomes induced by a bacterial Beclin 1 binding protein facilitate obligatory intracellular infection.,"Autophagy, a cytoplasmic catabolic process, plays a critical role in defense against intracellular infection. In turn, evasion or inhibition of autophagy has emerged as an important virulence factor for intracellular pathogens. However, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the obligatory intracellular bacterium that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis, replicates in the membrane-bound compartment resembling early autophagosome. Here, we found that Anaplasma translocated substrate 1 (Ats-1), a type IV secretion effector, binds Beclin 1, a subunit of the class III PI3K and Atg14L, and it nucleates autophagosomes with markers of omegasomes, double FYVE-containing protein 1, Atg14L, and LC3. Ats-1 autophagy induction did not activate the starvation signaling pathway of mammalian target of rapamycin. These autophagy proteins were also localized to the Anaplasma inclusion. Ectopically expressed Ats-1 targeted the Anaplasma inclusions and enhanced infection, whereas host cytoplasmic delivery of anti-Ats-1 or Beclin 1 depletion by siRNA suppressed the infection; beclin 1 heterozygous-deficient mice were resistant to Anaplasma infection. Furthermore, Anaplasma growth arrest by the class III PI3K inhibitor 3-methyladenine was alleviated by essential amino acid supplementation. Thus, Anaplasma actively induces autophagy by secreting Ats-1 that hijacks the Beclin 1-Atg14L autophagy initiation pathway likely to acquire host nutrients for its growth."
20133758,Human cytomegalovirus UL69 protein facilitates translation by associating with the mRNA cap-binding complex and excluding 4EBP1.,"4EBP1 is phosphorylated by the mTORC1 kinase. When mTORC1 activity is inhibited, hypophosphorylated 4EBP1 binds and sequesters eIF4E, a component of the mRNA cap-binding complex, and blocks translation. As a consequence, mTORC1 activity is needed to maintain active translation. The human cytomegalovirus pUL38 protein preserves mTORC1 activity, keeping most of the E4BP1 in the infected cell in a hyperphosphorylated, inactive state. Here we report that a second viral protein, pUL69, also antagonizes the activity of 4EBP1, but by a separate mechanism. pUL69 interacts directly with eIF4A1, an element of the cap-binding complex, and the poly(A)-binding protein, which binds to the complex. When pUL69 accumulates during infection with wild-type virus, 4EBP1 is excluded from the complex. However, 4EBP1 is present in the cap-binding complex after infection with a pUL69-deficient virus, coincident with reduced accumulation of several late virus-coded proteins. We propose that pUL69 supports translation in human cytomegalovirus-infected cells by excluding hypophosphorylated 4EBP1 from the cap-binding complex."
24643253,MAVS protein is attenuated by rotavirus nonstructural protein 1.,"Rotavirus is the single, most important agent of infantile gastroenteritis in many animal species, including humans. In developing countries, rotavirus infection attributes approximately 500,000 deaths annually. Like other viruses it establishes an intimate and complex interaction with the host cell to counteract the antiviral responses elicited by the cell. Among various pattern recognition receptors (PAMPs) of the host, the cytosolic RNA helicases interact with viral RNA to activate the Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling protein (MAVS), which regulates cellular interferon response. With an aim to identify the role of different PAMPs in rotavirus infected cell, MAVS was found to degrade in a time dependent and strain independent manner. Rotavirus non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) which is a known IFN antagonist, interacted with MAVS and degraded it in a strain independent manner, resulting in a complete loss of RNA sensing machinery in the infected cell. To best of our knowledge, this is the first report on NSP1 functionality where a signaling protein is targeted unanimously in all strains. In addition NSP1 inhibited the formation of detergent resistant MAVS aggregates, thereby averting the antiviral signaling cascade. The present study highlights the multifunctional role of rotavirus NSP1 and reinforces the fact that the virus orchestrates the cellular antiviral response to its own benefit by various back up strategies."
25624101,Theileria parasites secrete a prolyl isomerase to maintain host leukocyte transformation.,"Infectious agents develop intricate mechanisms to interact with host cell pathways and hijack their genetic and epigenetic machinery to change host cell phenotypic states. Among the Apicomplexa phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, which cause veterinary and human diseases, Theileria is the only genus that transforms its mammalian host cells. Theileria infection of bovine leukocytes induces proliferative and invasive phenotypes associated with activated signalling pathways, notably JNK and AP-1 (ref. 2). The transformed phenotypes are reversed by treatment with the theilericidal drug buparvaquone. We used comparative genomics to identify a homologue of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase PIN1 in T. annulata (TaPIN1) that is secreted into the host cell and modulates oncogenic signalling pathways. Here we show that TaPIN1 is a bona fide prolyl isomerase and that it interacts with the host ubiquitin ligase FBW7, leading to its degradation and subsequent stabilization of c-JUN, which promotes transformation. We performed in vitro and in silico analysis and in vivo zebrafish xenograft experiments to demonstrate that TaPIN1 is directly inhibited by the anti-parasite drug buparvaquone (and other known PIN1 inhibitors) and is mutated in a drug-resistant strain. Prolyl isomerization is thus a conserved mechanism that is important in cancer and is used by Theileria parasites to manipulate host oncogenic signalling."
26889034,"VP8, the Major Tegument Protein of Bovine Herpesvirus 1, Interacts with Cellular STAT1 and Inhibits Interferon Beta Signaling.","The UL47 gene product, VP8, is the most abundant tegument protein of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1). Previously, we demonstrated that a UL47-deleted BoHV-1 mutant (BoHV1-ΔUL47) exhibits 100-fold-reduced virulence in vitro and is avirulent in vivo In this study, we demonstrated that VP8 expression or BoHV-1 infection inhibits interferon beta (IFN-β) signaling by using an IFN-α/β-responsive plasmid in a luciferase assay. As transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) is an essential component in the IFN-signaling pathways, the effect of VP8 on STAT was investigated. An interaction between VP8 and STAT1 was established by coimmunoprecipitation assays in both VP8-transfected and BoHV-1-infected cells. Two domains of VP8, amino acids 259 to 482 and 632 to 686, were found to be responsible for its interaction with STAT1. The expression of VP8 did not induce STAT1 ubiquitination or degradation. Moreover, VP8 did not reduce STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation to downregulate IFN-β signaling. However, the expression of VP8 or a version of VP8 (amino acids 219 to 741) that contains the STAT1-interacting domains but not the nuclear localization signal prevented nuclear accumulation of STAT1. Inhibition of nuclear accumulation of STAT1 also occurred during BoHV-1 infection, while nuclear translocation of STAT1 was observed in BoHV1-ΔUL47-infected cells. During BoHV-1 infection, VP8 was detected in the cytoplasm at 2 h postinfection without any de novo protein synthesis, at which time STAT1 was already retained in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that viral VP8 downregulates IFN-β signaling early during infection, thus playing a role in overcoming the antiviral response of BoHV-1-infected cells."
23414759,The herpesvirus VP1/2 protein is an effector of dynein-mediated capsid transport and neuroinvasion.,"Microtubule transport of herpesvirus capsids from the cell periphery to the nucleus is imperative for viral replication and, in the case of many alphaherpesviruses, transmission into the nervous system. Using the neuroinvasive herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus (PRV), we show that the viral protein 1/2 (VP1/2) tegument protein associates with the dynein/dynactin microtubule motor complex and promotes retrograde microtubule transport of PRV capsids. Functional activation of VP1/2 requires binding to the capsid protein pUL25 or removal of the capsid-binding domain. A proline-rich sequence within VP1/2 is required for the efficient interaction with the dynein/dynactin microtubule motor complex as well as for PRV virulence and retrograde axon transport in vivo. Additionally, in the absence of infection, functionally active VP1/2 is sufficient to move large surrogate cargoes via the dynein/dynactin microtubule motor complex. Thus, VP1/2 tethers PRV capsids to dynein/dynactin to enhance microtubule transport, neuroinvasion, and pathogenesis."
24942588,Murine cytomegalovirus virion-associated protein M45 mediates rapid NF-κB activation after infection.,"Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) rapidly induces activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) upon infection of host cells. After a transient phase of activation, the MCMV M45 protein blocks all canonical NF-κB-activating pathways by inducing the degradation of the gamma subunit of the inhibitor of κB kinase complex (IKKγ; commonly referred to as the NF-κB essential modulator [NEMO]). Here we show that the viral M45 protein also mediates rapid NF-κB activation immediately after infection. MCMV mutants lacking M45 or expressing C-terminally truncated M45 proteins induced neither NF-κB activation nor transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes within the first 3 h of infection. Rapid NF-κB activation was absent in MCMV-infected NEMO-deficient fibroblasts, indicating that activation occurs at or upstream of the IKK complex. NF-κB activation was strongly reduced in murine fibroblasts lacking receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), a known M45-interacting protein, but was restored upon complementation with murine RIP1. However, the ability of M45 to interact with RIP1 and NEMO was not sufficient to induce NF-κB activation upon infection. In addition, incorporation of the M45 protein into virions was required. This was dependent on a C-terminal region of M45, which is not required for interaction with RIP1 and NEMO. We propose a model in which M45 delivered by viral particles activates NF-κB, presumably involving an interaction with RIP1 and NEMO. Later in infection, expression of M45 induces the degradation of NEMO and the shutdown of canonical NF-κB activation."
20142477,The early autophagic pathway is activated by hepatitis B virus and required for viral DNA replication.,"Autophagy is a catabolic process by which cells remove long-lived proteins and damaged organelles for recycling. Viral infections may also induce autophagic response. Here we show that hepatitis B virus (HBV), a pathogen that chronically infects approximately 350 million people globally, can enhance autophagic response in cell cultures, mouse liver, and during natural infection. This enhancement of the autophagic response is not coupled by an increase of autophagic protein degradation and is dependent on the viral X protein, which binds to and enhances the enzymatic activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class III, an enzyme critical for the initiation of autophagy. Further analysis indicates that autophagy enhances HBV DNA replication, with minimal involvement of late autophagic vacuoles in this process. Our studies thus demonstrate that a DNA virus can use autophagy to enhance its own replication and indicate the possibility of targeting the autophagic pathway for the treatment of HBV patients."
23431397,Morbillivirus v proteins exhibit multiple mechanisms to block type 1 and type 2 interferon signalling pathways.,"Morbilliviruses form a closely related group of pathogenic viruses which encode three non-structural proteins V, W and C in their P gene. Previous studies with rinderpest virus (RPV) and measles virus (MeV) have demonstrated that these non-structural proteins play a crucial role in blocking type I (IFNα/β) and type II (IFNγ) interferon action, and various mechanisms have been proposed for these effects. We have directly compared four important morbilliviruses, rinderpest (RPV), measles virus (MeV), peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and canine distemper virus (CDV). These viruses and their V proteins could all block type I IFN action. However, the viruses and their V proteins had varying abilities to block type II IFN action. The ability to block type II IFN-induced gene transcription correlated with co-precipitation of STAT1 with the respective V protein, but there was no correlation between co-precipitation of either STAT1 or STAT2 and the abilities of the V proteins to block type I IFN-induced gene transcription or the creation of the antiviral state. Further study revealed that the V proteins of RPV, MeV, PPRV and CDV could all interfere with phosphorylation of the interferon-receptor-associated kinase Tyk2, and the V protein of highly virulent RPV could also block the phosphorylation of another such kinase, Jak1. Co-precipitation studies showed that morbillivirus V proteins all form a complex containing Tyk2 and Jak1. This study highlights the ability of morbillivirus V proteins to target multiple components of the IFN signalling pathways to control both type I and type II IFN action."
23552410,Toscana virus NSs protein inhibits the induction of type I interferon by interacting with RIG-I.,"Toscana virus (TOSV) is a phlebovirus, of the Bunyaviridae family, that is responsible for central nervous system (CNS) injury in humans. Previous data have shown that the TOSV NSs protein is a gamma interferon (IFN-β) antagonist when transiently overexpressed in mammalian cells, inhibiting IRF-3 induction (G. Gori Savellini, F. Weber, C. Terrosi, M. Habjan, B. Martorelli, and M. G. Cusi, J. Gen. Virol. 92:71-79, 2011). In this study, we investigated whether an upstream sensor, which has a role in the signaling cascade leading to the production of type I IFN, was involved. We found a significant decrease in RIG-I protein levels in cells overexpressing TOSV NSs, suggesting that the nonstructural protein interacts with RIG-I and targets it for proteasomal degradation. In fact, the MG-132 proteasome inhibitor was able to restore IFN-β promoter activation in cells expressing NSs, demonstrating the existence of an evasion mechanism based on inhibition of the RIG-I sensor. Furthermore, a C-terminal truncated NSs protein (ΔNSs), although able to interact with RIG-I, did not affect the RIG-I-mediated IFN-β promoter activation, suggesting that the NSs domains responsible for RIG-I-mediated signaling and interaction with RIG-I are mapped on different regions. These results contribute to identify a novel mechanism for bunyaviruses by which TOSV NSs counteracts the early IFN response."
19264781,The human immunodeficiency virus type 2 Vpx protein usurps the CUL4A-DDB1 DCAF1 ubiquitin ligase to overcome a postentry block in macrophage infection.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) genomes encode several auxiliary proteins that have increasingly shown their importance in the virus-host relationship. One of these proteins, Vpx, is unique to the HIV-2/SIVsm lineage and is critical for viral replication in macrophages. The functional basis for this requirement, as well as the Vpx mode of action, has remained unexplained, and it is all the more enigmatic that HIV type 1 (HIV-1), which has no Vpx counterpart, can infect macrophages. Here, we underscore DCAF1 as a critical host effector of Vpx in its ability to mediate infection and long-term replication of HIV-2 in human macrophages. Vpx assembles with the CUL4A-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase through DCAF1 recruitment. Precluding Vpx present in the incoming virions from recruiting DCAF1 in target macrophages leads to a postentry block characterized by defective accumulation of HIV-2 reverse transcripts. In addition, Vpx from SIVsm functionally complements Vpx-defective HIV-2 in a DCAF1-binding-dependent manner. Altogether, our data point to a mechanism in which Vpx diverts the Cul4A-DDB1(DCAF1) ligase to inactivate an evolutionarily conserved factor, which restricts macrophage infection by HIV-2 and closely related simian viruses."
22685230,Moloney murine leukemia virus integrase and reverse transcriptase interact with PML proteins.,"Pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation of cell extracts in which the integrase or reverse transcriptase of Moloney murine leukemia virus was transiently expressed showed that both enzymes interacted with PML proteins. In infected cells, interaction between the integrase and PML was also observed. Transient expression of PIASy and SUMO proteins facilitated SUMOylation of the integrase but had no apparent effects on the interaction with PML. A FLAG-tagged integrase co-localized with PML protein possibly in the PML body. Knockdown of PML by small interfering RNA resulted in reduced viral cDNA levels and integration efficiency. This suggested that PML proteins activated reverse transcription."
16760386,"Bovine herpesvirus 1 immediate-early protein (bICP0) interacts with the histone acetyltransferase p300, which stimulates productive infection and gC promoter activity.","The immediate-early protein, bICP0, of Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) transactivates viral promoters and stimulates productive infection. bICP0 is expressed constitutively during productive infection, as its gene contains an immediate-early and an early promoter. Like other ICP0 homologues encoded by members of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, bICP0 contains a zinc RING finger located near its N terminus. Mutations that disrupt the bICP0 zinc RING finger impair its ability to activate transcription, stimulate productive infection, inhibit interferon-dependent transcription in certain cell types and regulate subnuclear localization. bICP0 also interacts with a cellular chromatin-remodelling enzyme, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and can relieve HDAC1-mediated transcriptional repression, suggesting that bICP0 inhibits silencing of the viral genome. In this study, it was shown that bICP0 interacted with the histone acetyltransferase p300 during productive infection and in transiently transfected cells. In addition, p300 enhanced BHV-1 productive infection and transactivated a late viral promoter (gC). In contrast, a CH3-domain deletion mutant of p300, which is a dominant-negative mutant, did not activate the gC promoter. bICP0 and p300 cooperated to activate the gC promoter, suggesting that there is a synergistic effect on promoter activation. As p300 can activate certain antiviral signalling pathways (for example, interferon), it was hypothesized that interactions between p300 and bICP0 may dampen the antiviral response following infection."
23842500,Structure and function of the Salmonella Typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) differs from most other salmonellae in that it causes a life-threatening systemic infection known as typhoid fever. The molecular bases for its unique clinical presentation are unknown. Here we find that the systemic administration of typhoid toxin, a unique virulence factor of S. Typhi, reproduces many of the acute symptoms of typhoid fever in an animal model. We identify specific carbohydrate moieties on specific surface glycoproteins that serve as receptors for typhoid toxin, which explains its broad cell target specificity. We present the atomic structure of typhoid toxin, which shows an unprecedented A2B5 organization with two covalently linked A subunits non-covalently associated to a pentameric B subunit. The structure provides insight into the toxin's receptor-binding specificity and delivery mechanisms and reveals how the activities of two powerful toxins have been co-opted into a single, unique toxin that can induce many of the symptoms characteristic of typhoid fever. These findings may lead to the development of potentially life-saving therapeutics against typhoid fever."
24275656,Crystal structures of the Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains from the Brucella protein TcpB and host adaptor TIRAP reveal mechanisms of molecular mimicry.,"The Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains are crucial innate immune signaling modules. Microbial TIR domain-containing proteins inhibit Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling through molecular mimicry. The TIR domain-containing protein TcpB from Brucella inhibits TLR signaling through interaction with host adaptor proteins TIRAP/Mal and MyD88. To characterize the microbial mimicry of host proteins, we have determined the X-ray crystal structures of the TIR domains from the Brucella protein TcpB and the host adaptor protein TIRAP. We have further characterized homotypic interactions of TcpB using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and heterotypic TcpB and TIRAP interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and NF-κB reporter assays. The crystal structure of the TcpB TIR domain reveals the microtubule-binding site encompassing the BB loop as well as a symmetrical dimer mediated by the DD and EE loops. This dimerization interface is validated by peptide mapping through hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. The human TIRAP TIR domain crystal structure reveals a unique N-terminal TIR domain fold containing a disulfide bond formed by Cys(89) and Cys(134). A comparison between the TcpB and TIRAP crystal structures reveals substantial conformational differences in the region that encompasses the BB loop. These findings underscore the similarities and differences in the molecular features found in the microbial and host TIR domains, which suggests mechanisms of bacterial mimicry of host signaling adaptor proteins, such as TIRAP."
21918512,The NLRC4 inflammasome receptors for bacterial flagellin and type III secretion apparatus.,"Inflammasomes are large cytoplasmic complexes that sense microbial infections/danger molecules and induce caspase-1 activation-dependent cytokine production and macrophage inflammatory death. The inflammasome assembled by the NOD-like receptor (NLR) protein NLRC4 responds to bacterial flagellin and a conserved type III secretion system (TTSS) rod component. How the NLRC4 inflammasome detects the two bacterial products and the molecular mechanism of NLRC4 inflammasome activation are not understood. Here we show that NAIP5, a BIR-domain NLR protein required for Legionella pneumophila replication in mouse macrophages, is a universal component of the flagellin-NLRC4 pathway. NAIP5 directly and specifically interacted with flagellin, which determined the inflammasome-stimulation activities of different bacterial flagellins. NAIP5 engagement by flagellin promoted a physical NAIP5-NLRC4 association, rendering full reconstitution of a flagellin-responsive NLRC4 inflammasome in non-macrophage cells. The related NAIP2 functioned analogously to NAIP5, serving as a specific inflammasome receptor for TTSS rod proteins such as Salmonella PrgJ and Burkholderia BsaK. Genetic analysis of Chromobacterium violaceum infection revealed that the TTSS needle protein CprI can stimulate NLRC4 inflammasome activation in human macrophages. Similarly, CprI is specifically recognized by human NAIP, the sole NAIP family member in human. The finding that NAIP proteins are inflammasome receptors for bacterial flagellin and TTSS apparatus components further predicts that the remaining NAIP family members may recognize other unidentified microbial products to activate NLRC4 inflammasome-mediated innate immunity."
23015697,Human metapneumovirus M2-2 protein inhibits innate cellular signaling by targeting MAVS.,"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a leading cause of respiratory infections in pediatric populations globally, with no prophylactic or therapeutic measures. Recently, a recombinant hMPV lacking the M2-2 protein (rhMPV-ΔM2-2) demonstrated reduced replication in the respiratory tract of animal models, making it a promising live vaccine candidate. However, the exact nature of the interaction between the M2-2 protein and host cells that regulates viral infection/propagation is largely unknown. By taking advantage of the available reverse genetics system and ectopic expression system for viral protein, we found that M2-2 not only promotes viral gene transcription and replication but subverts host innate immunity, therefore identifying M2-2 as a novel virulence factor, in addition to the previously described hMPV G protein. Since we have shown that the RIG-I/MAVS pathway plays an important role in hMPV-induced signaling in airway epithelial cells, we investigated whether M2-2 antagonizes the host cellular responses by targeting this pathway. Reporter gene assays and coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that M2-2 targets MAVS, an inhibitory mechanism different from what we previously reported for hMPV G, which affects RIG-I- but not MAVS-dependent gene transcription. In addition, we found that the domains of M2-2 responsible for the regulation of viral gene transcription and antiviral signaling are different. Our findings collectively demonstrate that M2-2 contributes to hMPV immune evasion through the inhibition of MAVS-dependent cellular responses."
20534570,Use of allostery to identify inhibitors of calmodulin-induced activation of Bacillus anthracis edema factor.,"Allostery plays a key role in the regulation of the activity and function of many biomolecules. And although many ligands act through allostery, no systematic use is made of it in drug design strategies. Here we describe a procedure for identifying the regions of a protein that can be used to control its activity through allostery. This procedure is based on the construction of a plausible conformational path, which describes protein transition between known active and inactive conformations. The path is calculated by using a framework approach that steers and markedly improves the conjugate peak refinement method. The evolution of conformations along this path was used to identify a putative allosteric site that could regulate activation of Bacillus anthracis adenylyl cyclase toxin (EF) by calmodulin. Conformations of the allosteric site at different steps along the path from the inactive (free) to the active (bound to calmodulin) forms of EF were used to perform virtual screenings and propose candidate EF inhibitors. Several candidates then proved to inhibit calmodulin-induced activation in an in vitro assay. The most potent compound fully inhibited EF at a concentration of 10 microM. The compounds also inhibited the related adenylyl cyclase toxin from Bordetella pertussis (CyaA). The specific homology between the putative allosteric sites in both toxins supports that these pockets are the actual binding sites of the selected inhibitors."
9343261,Bovine herpesvirus 4 BORFE2 protein inhibits Fas- and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-induced apoptosis and contains death effector domains shared with other gamma-2 herpesviruses.,"Fas- and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)-induced apoptosis is mediated by the interaction of FADD with caspase-8. Here, we report that the bovine herpesvirus 4 (BHV4) BORFE2 gene encodes a protein that inhibits Fas- and TNFR1-induced apoptosis and contains death effector domains (DEDs). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that the BORFE2 protein interacts with the prodomain of caspase-8. Furthermore, we show that BHV4 BORFE2 is a member of a family of DED-containing proteins that includes other gamma-2 herpesviruses, such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and herpesvirus saimiri."
18632959,"The Npro product of classical swine fever virus interacts with IkappaBalpha, the NF-kappaB inhibitor.","Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) belongs to the genus Pestivirus and is the causative agent of classical swine fever, a haemorrhagic disease of pigs. The virus replicates in host cells without activating interferon (IFN) production and has been reported to be an antagonist of double-stranded RNA-induced apoptosis. The N-terminal protease (N(pro)) of CSFV is responsible for this evasion of the host innate immune response. In order to identify cellular proteins that interact with the N(pro) product of CSFV, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human library was carried out, which identified IkappaBalpha, the inhibitor of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor involved in the control of apoptosis, the immune response and IFN production. The N(pro)-IkappaBalpha interaction was confirmed using yeast two-hybrid analysis and additional co-precipitation assays. It was also shown that N(pro) localizes to both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in stably transfected cells and in CSFV-infected cells. Following stimulation by tumour necrosis factor alpha, PK-15 cell lines expressing N(pro) exhibited transient nuclear accumulation of pIkappaBalpha, but no effect of CSFV infection on IkappaBalpha localization or NF-kappaB p65 activation was observed."
9569025,"The Ski oncoprotein interacts with Skip, the human homolog of Drosophila Bx42.","The v-Ski avian retroviral oncogene is postulated to act as a transcription factor. Since protein-protein interactions have been shown to play an important role in the transcription process, we attempted to identify Ski protein partners with the yeast two-hybrid system. Using v-Ski sequence as bait, the human gene skip (Ski Interacting Protein) was identified as encoding a protein which interacts with both the cellular and viral forms of Ski in the two-hybrid system. Skip is highly homologous to the Drosophila melanogaster protein Bx42 which is found associated with chromatin in transcriptionally active puffs of salivary glands. The Ski-Skip interaction is potentially important in Ski's transforming activity since Skip was demonstrated to interact with a highly conserved region of Ski required for transforming activity. Like Ski, Skip is expressed in multiple tissue types and is localized to the cell nucleus."
15858022,Identification of domains in gag important for prototypic foamy virus egress.,"Sequence motifs (L domains) have been described in viral structural proteins. Mutations in these lead to a defect at a late stage in virus assembly and budding. For several viruses, recruitment of an endosomal sorting complexes required for transport 1 subunit (Tsg101), a component of the class E vacuolar protein sorting (EVPS) machinery, is a prerequisite for virion budding. To effect this, Tsg101 interacts with the PT/SAP L domain. We have identified candidate L-domain motifs, PSAP, PPPI, and YEIL, in the prototypic foamy virus (PFV) Gag protein, based on their homology to known viral L domains. Mutation of the PSAP and PPPI motifs individually reduced PFV egress, and their combined mutation had an additive effect. When PSAP was mutated, residual infectious PFV release was unaffected by dominant negative Vps4 (an ATPase involved in the final stages of budding), and sensitivity to dominant negative Tsg101 was dramatically reduced, suggesting that the PSAP motif functions as a conventional class E VPS-dependent L domain. Consistent with this notion, yeast two-hybrid analysis showed a PSAP motif-dependent interaction between PFV Gag and Tsg101. Surprisingly, PFV release which is dependent on the PPPI motif was Vps4-independent and was partially inhibited by dominant negative Tsg101, suggesting that PPPI functions by an unconventional mechanism to facilitate PFV egress. Mutation of the YEIL sequence completely abolished particle formation and also reduced the rate of Gag processing by the viral protease, suggesting that the integrity of YEIL is required at an assembly step prior to budding and YEIL is not acting as an L domain."
28220872,Human enterovirus 71 protein interaction network prompts antiviral drug repositioning.,"As a predominant cause of human hand, foot, and mouth disease, enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection may lead to serious diseases and result in severe consequences that threaten public health and cause widespread panic. Although the systematic identification of physical interactions between viral proteins and host proteins provides initial information for the recognition of the cellular mechanism involved in viral infection and the development of new therapies, EV71-host protein interactions have not been explored. Here, we identified interactions between EV71 proteins and host cellular proteins and confirmed the functional relationships of EV71-interacting proteins (EIPs) with virus proliferation and infection by integrating a human protein interaction network and by functional annotation. We found that most EIPs had known interactions with other viruses. We also predicted ATP6V0C as a broad-spectrum essential host factor and validated its essentiality for EV71 infection in vitro. EIPs and their interacting proteins were more likely to be targets of anti-inflammatory and neurological drugs, indicating their potential to serve as host-oriented antiviral targets. Thus, we used a connectivity map to find drugs that inhibited EIP expression. We predicted tanespimycin as a candidate and demonstrated its antiviral efficiency in vitro. These findings provide the first systematic identification of EV71-host protein interactions, an analysis of EIP protein characteristics and a demonstration of their value in developing host-oriented antiviral therapies."
19060135,"Mycobacterium avium genes MAV_5138 and MAV_3679 are transcriptional regulators that play a role in invasion of epithelial cells, in part by their regulation of CipA, a putative surface protein interacting with host cell signaling pathways.","The Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is an important group of opportunistic pathogens for birds, cattle, swine, and immunosuppressed humans. Although invasion of epithelial cells lining the intestine is the chief point of entry for these organisms, little is known about the mechanisms by which members of the MAC are taken up by these cells. Studies with M. avium have shown that cytoskeletal rearrangement via activation of the small G-protein Cdc42 is involved and that this activation is regulated in part by the M. avium fadD2 gene. The fadD2 gene indirectly regulates a number of genes upon exposure to HEp-2 cells, including transcriptional regulators, membrane proteins, and secreted proteins. Overexpression of two fadD2-associated regulators (MAV_5138 and MAV_3679) led to increased invasion of HEp-2 cells, as well as altered expression of other genes. The protein product of one of the regulated genes, named CipA, has domains that resemble the PXXP motif of human Piccolo proteins, which bind SH3 domains in proteins involved in the scaffold complex formed during cytoskeletal rearrangement. Although CipA was not detected in the cytoplasm of HEp-2 cells exposed to M. avium, the recombinant protein was shown to be potentially expressed on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis incubated with HEp-2 cells and, possibly, to interact with human Cdc42. The interaction was then confirmed by showing that CipA activates Cdc42. These results suggest that members of the M. avium complex have a novel mechanism for activating cytoskeletal rearrangement, prompting uptake by host epithelial cells, and that this mechanism is regulated in part by fadD2, MAV_5138, and MAV_3679."
21347310,The RACK1 signaling scaffold protein selectively interacts with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis virulence function.,"Many gram-negative bacteria use type III secretion systems to translocate effector proteins into host cells. These effectors interfere with cellular functions in a highly regulated manner resulting in effects that are beneficial for the bacteria. The pathogen Yersinia can resist phagocytosis by eukaryotic cells by translocating Yop effectors into the target cell cytoplasm. This is called antiphagocytosis, and constitutes an important virulence feature of this pathogen since it allows survival in immune cell rich lymphoid organs. We show here that the virulence protein YopK has a role in orchestrating effector translocation necessary for productive antiphagocytosis. We present data showing that YopK influences Yop effector translocation by modulating the ratio of the pore-forming proteins YopB and YopD in the target cell membrane. Further, we show that YopK that can interact with the translocators, is exposed inside target cells and binds to the eukaryotic signaling protein RACK1. This protein is engaged upon Y. pseudotuberculosis-mediated β1-integrin activation and localizes to phagocytic cups. Cells with downregulated RACK1 levels are protected from antiphagocytosis. This resistance is not due to altered levels of translocated antiphagocytic effectors, and cells with reduced levels of RACK1 are still sensitive to the later occurring cytotoxic effect caused by the Yop effectors. Further, a yopK mutant unable to bind RACK1 shows an avirulent phenotype during mouse infection, suggesting that RACK1 targeting by YopK is a requirement for virulence. Together, our data imply that the local event of Yersinia-mediated antiphagocytosis involves a step where YopK, by binding RACK1, ensures an immediate specific spatial delivery of antiphagocytic effectors leading to productive inhibition of phagocytosis."
12621437,Apolipoprotein L-I is the trypanosome lytic factor of human serum.,"Human sleeping sickness in east Africa is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The basis of this pathology is the resistance of these parasites to lysis by normal human serum (NHS). Resistance to NHS is conferred by a gene that encodes a truncated form of the variant surface glycoprotein termed serum resistance associated protein (SRA). We show that SRA is a lysosomal protein, and that the amino-terminal alpha-helix of SRA is responsible for resistance to NHS. This domain interacts strongly with a carboxy-terminal alpha-helix of the human-specific serum protein apolipoprotein L-I (apoL-I). Depleting NHS of apoL-I, by incubation with SRA or anti-apoL-I, led to the complete loss of trypanolytic activity. Addition of native or recombinant apoL-I either to apoL-I-depleted NHS or to fetal calf serum induced lysis of NHS-sensitive, but not NHS-resistant, trypanosomes. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that apoL-I is taken up through the endocytic pathway into the lysosome. We propose that apoL-I is the trypanosome lytic factor of NHS, and that SRA confers resistance to lysis by interaction with apoL-I in the lysosome."
17577209,The interactome of the histone gene regulatory factor HiNF-P suggests novel cell cycle related roles in transcriptional control and RNA processing.,"HiNF-P is a recently identified histone H4 subtype specific transcriptional regulator that associates with the conserved cell cycle control element in the proximal promoter regions of histone H4 genes. HiNF-P interacts with the global histone gene regulator and direct cyclin E/CDK2 substrate p220(NPAT) to potently upregulate histone H4 gene transcription at the G1/S phase transition in response to cyclin E/CDK2 signaling. To gain insight into the function of HiNF-P in a broader cellular context, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify its novel interacting proteins. In this study, we detected 67 candidate HiNF-P interacting proteins of varying cellular functions. We have identified multiple RNA associated proteins, including the splicing co-factor SRm300. HiNF-P and SRm300 interact in yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-immunofluorescence assays. Our screen also identified several gene regulators that associate with HiNF-P including THAP7. HiNF-P and THAP7 interact in mammalian cells and THAP7 abrogates HiNF-P/p220 mediated activation of histone H4 gene transcription, consistent with its known role as a transcriptional repressor. Finally, we identified several proliferation related proteins including Ki-67 and X transactivated protein 2 (XTP2) which may be functioning with HiNF-P in cell cycle regulation. The HiNF-P interactome indicates that HiNF-P is a multifunctional gene regulator with a large functional network and roles beyond cell cycle-dependent histone gene regulation."
11113112,"vCLAP, a caspase-recruitment domain-containing protein of equine Herpesvirus-2, persistently activates the Ikappa B kinases through oligomerization of IKKgamma.","vCLAP, the E10 gene product of equine herpesvirus-2, is a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein that has been shown to induce both apoptosis and NF-kappaB activation in mammalian cells. vCLAP has a cellular counterpart, Bcl10/cCLAP, which is also an activator of apoptosis and NF-kappaB. Recent studies demonstrated that vCLAP activates NF-kappaB through an IkappaB kinase (IKK)-dependent pathway, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that vCLAP associates stably with the IKK complex through direct binding to the C-terminal region of IKKgamma. Consistent with this finding, IKKgamma was found to be essential for vCLAP-induced NF-kappaB activation, and the association between vCLAP and the IKK complex induced persistent activation of the IKKs. Moreover, enforced oligomerization of the isolated C-terminal region of vCLAP, which interacts with IKKgamma, can trigger NF-kappaB activation. Finally, substitution of the C-terminal region of IKKgamma, which interacts with vCLAP, with the CARD of vCLAP or Bcl10 produced a molecule that was able to activate NF-kappaB when ectopically expressed in IKKgamma-deficient cells. These data suggest that vCLAP-induced oligomerization of IKKgamma, which is mediated by the CARD of vCLAP, could be the mechanism by which vCLAP induces activation of NF-kappaB."
19880448,The PPE18 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis interacts with TLR2 and activates IL-10 induction in macrophage.,"The pathophysiological functions of proline-glutamic acid (PE)/proline-proline-glutamic acid (PPE) family of proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that one of the PPE proteins, PPE18 can stimulate macrophages to secrete IL-10, known to favor a Th2 type response. The recombinant PPE18 was found to specifically interact with the TLR2 leading to an early and sustained activation of p38 MAPK, which is critical for IL-10 induction. In silico docking analyses and mutation experiments indicate that PPE18 specifically interacts with the leucine rich repeat 11 approximately 15 domain of TLR2 and the site of interaction is different from that of a synthetic lipopeptide Pam(3)CSK(4) known to activate predominantly ERK 1/2. When PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages were infected with a mutant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain lacking the PPE18, produced poorer levels of IL-10 as compared with those infected with the wild-type strain. In contrast, an M. smegmatis strain overexpressing the PPE18 induced higher levels of IL-10 in infected macrophages. Our data indicate that the PPE18 protein may trigger an anti-inflammatory response by inducing IL-10 production."
17709412,The surface protein Srr-1 of Streptococcus agalactiae binds human keratin 4 and promotes adherence to epithelial HEp-2 cells.,"Streptococcus agalactiae is frequently the cause of bacterial sepsis and meningitis in neonates. In addition, it is a commensal bacterium that colonizes the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. During its commensal and pathogenic lifestyles, S. agalactiae colonizes and invades a number of host compartments, thereby interacting with different host proteins. In the present study, the serine-rich repeat protein Srr-1 from S. agalactiae was functionally investigated. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that Srr-1 was localized on the surface of streptococcal cells. The Srr-1 protein was shown to interact with a 62-kDa protein in human saliva, which was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight analysis as human keratin 4 (K4). Immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments allowed us to narrow down the K4 binding domain in Srr-1 to a region of 157 amino acids (aa). Furthermore, the Srr-1 binding domain of K4 was identified in the C-terminal 255 aa of human K4. Deletion of the srr-1 gene in the genome of S. agalactiae revealed that this gene plays a role in bacterial binding to human K4 and that it is involved in adherence to epithelial HEp-2 cells. Binding to immobilized K4 and adherence to HEp-2 cells were restored by introducing the srr-1 gene on a shuttle plasmid into the srr-1 mutant. Furthermore, incubation of HEp-2 cells with the K4 binding domain of Srr-1 blocked S. agalactiae adherence to epithelial cells in a dose-dependent fashion. This is the first report describing the interaction of a bacterial protein with human K4."
10531265,"Overexpression of the Candida albicans ALA1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in aggregation following attachment of yeast cells to extracellular matrix proteins, adherence properties similar to those of Candida albicans.","Candida albicans maintains a commensal relationship with human hosts, probably by adhering to mucosal tissue in a variety of physiological conditions. We show that adherence due to the C. albicans gene ALA1 when transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is comprised of two sequential steps. Initially, C. albicans rapidly attaches to extracellular matrix (ECM) protein-coated magnetic beads in small numbers (the attachment phase). This is followed by a relatively slower step in which cell-to-cell interactions predominate (the aggregation phase). Neither of these phases is observed in S. cerevisiae. However, expression of the C. albicans ALA1 gene from a low-copy vector causes S. cerevisiae transformants to attach to ECM-coated magnetic beads without appreciable aggregation. Expression of ALA1 from a high-copy vector results in both attachment and aggregation. Moreover, transcriptional fusion of ALA1 with the galactose-inducible promoters GALS, GALL, and GAL1, allowing for low, moderate, and high levels of inducible transcription, respectively, causes attachment and aggregation that correlates with the strength of the GAL promoter. The adherence of C. albicans and S. cerevisiae overexpressing ALA1 to a number of protein ligands occurs over a broad pH range, is resistant to shear forces generated by vortexing, and is unaffected by the presence of sugars, high salt levels, free ligands, or detergents. Adherence is, however, inhibited by agents that disrupt hydrogen bonds. The similarities in the adherence and aggregation properties of C. albicans and S. cerevisiae overexpressing ALA1 suggest a role in adherence and aggregation for ALA1 and ALA1-like genes in C. albicans."
12787366,Surface localized glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Mycoplasma genitalium binds mucin.,"Mycoplasma genitalium is the smallest known self-replicating cell. It was first isolated from urethral specimens in individuals with non-gonococcal urethritis and, more recently, from respiratory and synovial sites. Our laboratory has been interested in defining the mechanisms by which M. genitalium adheres to and colonizes host cell surfaces. In order to determine potential targets of adherence, we examined the interaction of M. genitalium with a primary component of the mucosal epithelial lining, mucin (Mn). Three Mn-binding proteins (MnBPs) of M. genitalium were isolated by affinity chromatography. One of these proteins was identified by N-terminal sequencing as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-drogenase (GAPDH). Antiserum raised against recombinant GAPDH blocked binding of intact biosynthetically labelled mycoplasmas to mucin by approximately 70%. Whole cell radioimmunoprecipitation indicated that GAPDH was surface-accessible and surface localization of GAPDH was further verified by membrane fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy. The role of GAPDH as an adhesin to Mn not only provides insights into the organism's mechanisms of adherence and colonization but also into its ability to maximize its limited genome."
15371430,"VIAF, a conserved inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)-interacting factor that modulates caspase activation.","Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are involved in the suppression of apoptosis, signal transduction, cell cycle control and gene regulation. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of viral IAP-associated factor (VIAF), a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed phosphoprotein with limited homology to members of the phosducin family that associates with baculovirus Op-IAP. VIAF bound Op-IAP both in vitro and in intact cells, with each protein displaying a predominantly cytoplasmic localization. VIAF lacks a consensus IAP binding motif, and overexpression of VIAF failed to prevent Op-IAP from protecting human cells from a variety of apoptotic stimuli, suggesting that VIAF does not function as an IAP antagonist. VIAF was unable to directly inhibit caspase activation in vitro and a reduction of VIAF protein levels by RNA interference led to a decrease in Bax-mediated caspase activation, suggesting that VIAF functions to co-regulate the apoptotic cascade. Finally, VIAF is a substrate for ubiquitination mediated by Op-IAP. Thus, VIAF is a novel IAP-interacting factor that functions in caspase activation during apoptosis."
2313285,In vivo measurements of ethanol concentration in rabbit brain by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"In vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure the cerebral ethanol concentration in the rabbit after both intraarterial and intragastric administration. There was good agreement between cerebral and blood ethanol concentrations at all times after administration by either route. Cerebral ethanol levels, measured using in vivo 1H spectroscopy, agreed well with those measured in perchloric acid extracts of brain, analyzed by both high-resolution 1H spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Ethanol may be useful as an indicator to measure cerebral blood flow by 1H spectroscopy and chemical shift-selective magnetic resonance imaging."
19208651,The ataxia protein sacsin is a functional co-chaperone that protects against polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1.,"An extensive protein-protein interaction network has been identified between proteins implicated in inherited ataxias. The protein sacsin, which is mutated in the early-onset neurodegenerative disease autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay, is a node in this interactome. Here, we have established the neuronal expression of sacsin and functionally characterized domains of the 4579 amino acid protein. Sacsin is most highly expressed in large neurons, particularly within brain motor systems, including cerebellar Purkinje cells. Its subcellular localization in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells was predominantly cytoplasmic with a mitochondrial component. We identified a putative ubiquitin-like (UbL) domain at the N-terminus of sacsin and demonstrated an interaction with the proteasome. Furthermore, sacsin contains a predicted J-domain, the defining feature of DnaJ/Hsp40 proteins. Using a bacterial complementation assay, the sacsin J-domain was demonstrated to be functional. The presence of both UbL and J-domains in sacsin suggests that it may integrate the ubiquitin-proteasome system and Hsp70 function to a specific cellular role. The Hsp70 chaperone machinery is an important component of the cellular response towards aggregation prone mutant proteins that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We therefore investigated the effects of siRNA-mediated sacsin knockdown on polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1. Importantly, SACS siRNA did not affect cell viability with GFP-ataxin-1[30Q], but enhanced the toxicity of GFP-ataxin-1[82Q], suggesting that sacsin is protective against mutant ataxin-1. Thus, sacsin is an ataxia protein and a regulator of the Hsp70 chaperone machinery that is implicated in the processing of other ataxia-linked proteins."
22176891,The interaction between the PARP10 protein and the NS1 protein of H5N1 AIV and its effect on virus replication.,"During the process that AIV infect hosts, the NS1 protein can act on hosts, change corresponding signal pathways, promote the translation of virus proteins and result in virus replication."
11958450,Host cell proteins binding to the encapsidation signal epsilon in hepatitis B virus RNA.,"The highly conserved encapsidation signal (epsilon) of hepatitis B viral (HBV) pregenomic RNA has been reported as an essential component for encapsidation and protein priming of HBV polymerase. Here, we report that two HBV epsilon RNA-binding host proteins (80 and 43 kDa) and a copurifying protein (100 kDa) were purified and characterized by the combined methods of UV cross-linking analysis with the epsilon RNA and column chromatography. Amino-terminal microsequencing showed that 80- and 43-kDa proteins were identified as the heterodimeric nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF90/NF45) and 100 kDa as a molecular chaperone, the GRP94. The heterodimeric factor interacted preferentially with the upper-bulge region of HBV epsilon RNA helping the HBV polymerase bind the lower-bulge region. Using in vitro protein priming analysis, the initial oligonucleotide of the protein-priming product was deduced as 5'-GAAC-3', which is the complementary sequence of both regions of DR1 and epsilon in the pregenomic RNA. Previously, we also proposed that the GRP94 was associated with HBV polymerase in the human liver cell HepG2. These results suggest that the heterodimeric factor plays an important role in the priming activity of HBV polymerase."
27899274,Systematic identification of hepatitis E virus ORF2 interactome reveals that TMEM134 engages in ORF2-mediated NF-κB pathway.,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of acute hepatitis E. Open reading frame 2 (ORF2) encodes the capsid protein of HEV, which is the main structural protein and may participate, together with the host factors, in viral entry and egress. However, it is still not clear which host proteins are involved in the interaction with ORF2 and what the functions of these ORF2-interacting proteins are. In this study, we have applied a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid screening approach in combination with the pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, identified and validated multiple interacting partners of ORF2 of genotype 1 and 4, which have diverse biological functions. Among these novel candidates that have not been previously reported, we have found that 20 of them are located in endoplasmic reticulum. TMEM134, which interacts and co-localizes with ORF2 in the endoplasmic reticulum, negatively regulates ORF2-mediated inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study for the first time has systematically mapped the ORF2 interactome in two genotypes of HEV, providing a new insight of understanding the virus-host interaction during the pathogenesis of HEV, and may offer potential therapeutic targets to intervene the HEV life cycle."
16906531,The IgD CH1 region contains the binding site for the human respiratory pathogen Moraxella catarrhalis IgD-binding protein MID.,"The Moraxella catarrhalis IgD-binding protein (MID) has a unique specificity for human IgD, and the sequence with maximal IgD binding is located within the amino acids MID962-1200. In the present paper, we examined the MID binding site on IgD using a series of recombinant Ig. Full-length IgD, IgD F(ab')2, and an IgD F(ab') C290R mutant lacking the inter-heavy-chain cysteine 290 were manufactured. Furthermore, a series of IgD/IgG chimeras were constructed. ELISA, dot blot and flow cytometry were used to study the binding of purified Ig to native MID, recombinant MID962-1200 or to Moraxella with or without MID. MID962-1200 bound both the IgD F(ab')2 and F(ab') C290R, indicating that the binding occurred independently of antibody structure. When amino acids 157-224 of the IgD CH1 region were substituted with IgG sequences, binding by M. catarrhalis or recombinant MID962-1200 was abolished. Subsequent smaller substitutions of IgD CH1 157-224 with IgG sequences led us to conclude that IgD CH1 amino acids 198-206 were crucial for the interaction between MID and IgD."
18808384,"Identification of a novel protein promoting the colonization and survival of Finegoldia magna, a bacterial commensal and opportunistic pathogen.","Anaerobic bacteria dominate the human normal microbiota, but strikingly little is known about these commensals. Finegoldia magna is a Gram-positive anaerobe found in the skin and at other non-sterile body surfaces, but it is also an opportunistic pathogen. This study describes a novel protein designated FAF (F. magna adhesion factor) and expressed by more than 90% of F. magna isolates. The protein is present in substantial quantities at the F. magna surface but is also released from the surface. FAF forms large protein aggregates in solution and surface-associated FAF causes bacterial clumping. In skin F. magna bacteria were localized to the epidermis, where they adhere to basement membranes. FAF was found to mediate this adhesion via interactions with BM-40, a basement membrane protein. The biological significance of FAF is further underlined by the observation that it blocks the activity of LL-37, a major human antibacterial peptide. Altogether, the data demonstrate that FAF plays an important role in colonization and survival of F. magna in the human host."
21546586,Role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in mediating interactions with the human extracellular matrix.,"In different, phylogenetically unrelated micro-organisms, glycolytic enzymes play a dual role. In the cytosol they are involved in metabolic reactions whereas the surface-localized fraction of the enzymes contributes to adhesion and virulence. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a typical member of this group of multifunctional proteins. In this study, we characterized the GAPDH of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common pathogen of the human respiratory mucosa. Full-length GAPDH of M. pneumoniae was successfully expressed and used to produce a polyclonal antiserum. By immunofluorescence, colony blot and ELISA experiments with different fractions of the M. pneumoniae proteins, GAPDH was demonstrated to be present in the cytosol and at even higher concentrations at the surface of mycoplasmas. Nevertheless, antibodies against recombinant GAPDH were not detected in sera of immunized animals or of patients with confirmed M. pneumoniae infection. Recombinant GAPDH bound to different human cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner, and binding was inhibited by specific anti-GAPDH serum. In contrast, this antiserum did not significantly influence the adherence of M. pneumoniae to HeLa cells. When different human extracellular matrix proteins were tested in Western blot assays, GAPDH bound to fibrinogen. The results showed that the GAPDH of M. pneumoniae is a member of the family of cytosol-localized glycolytic enzymes, which also occur at the surface of the bacterium, and mediates interactions with the extracellular matrix proteins of the human host. Thus, the surface-exposed fraction of GAPDH may be a factor that contributes to the successful colonization of the human respiratory tract by M. pneumoniae."
24835392,Identification of a Haemophilus influenzae factor H-Binding lipoprotein involved in serum resistance.,"Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative human pathogen that resides in the upper respiratory tract. Encapsulated H. influenzae type b (Hib) and type f (Hif) are the most common serotypes associated with invasive disease. H. influenzae displays various strategies to circumvent the host innate immune response, including the bactericidal effect of the complement system. In this study, we identified an H. influenzae lipoprotein having the ability to bind factor H (FH), the major regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation. This protein, named protein H (PH), was surface exposed and was found in all clinical Hib and Hif isolates tested. Deletion of the gene encoding for PH (lph) in Hib and Hif significantly reduced the interaction between bacteria and FH. When Hib and Hif PH variants were separately expressed in nontypeable (unencapsulated) H. influenzae, which did not bind FH, an increased FH affinity was observed. We recombinantly expressed the two PH variants in Escherichia coli, and despite sharing only 56% identical amino acids, both FH-binding Haemophilus proteins similarly interacted with the complement regulator FH short consensus repeats 7 and 18-20. Importantly, Hib and Hif resistance against the bactericidal effect of human serum was significantly reduced when bacterial mutants devoid of PH were tested. In conclusion, we have characterized a hitherto unknown bacterial protein that is crucial for mediating an interaction between the human pathogen H. influenzae and FH. This novel interaction is important for H. influenzae resistance against complement activation and will consequently promote bacterial pathogenesis."
26095031,Structures of Orf Virus Chemokine Binding Protein in Complex with Host Chemokines Reveal Clues to Broad Binding Specificity.,"The chemokine binding protein (CKBP) from orf virus (ORFV) binds with high affinity to chemokines from three classes, C, CC, and CXC, making it unique among poxvirus CKBPs described to date. We present its crystal structure alone and in complex with three CC chemokines, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL7. ORFV CKBP possesses a β-sandwich fold that is electrostatically and sterically complementary to its binding partners. Chemokines bind primarily through interactions involving the N-terminal loop and a hydrophobic recess on the ORFV CKBP β-sheet II surface, and largely polar interactions between the chemokine 20s loop and a negatively charged surface groove located at one end of the CKBP β-sheet II surface. ORFV CKBP interacts with leukocyte receptor and glycosaminoglycan binding sites found on the surface of bound chemokines. SEC-MALLS and chromatographic evidence is presented supporting that ORFV CKBP is a dimer in solution over a broad range of protein concentrations."
27145901,The extracellular interactome of the human adenovirus family reveals diverse strategies for immunomodulation.,"Viruses encode secreted and cell-surface expressed proteins essential to modulate host immune defenses and establish productive infections. However, to date there has been no systematic study of the extracellular interactome of any human virus. Here we utilize the E3 proteins, diverse and rapidly evolving transmembrane-containing proteins encoded by human adenoviruses, as a model system to survey the extracellular immunomodulatory landscape. From a large-scale protein interaction screen against a microarray of more than 1,500 human proteins, we find and validate 51 previously unidentified virus-host interactions. Our results uncover conserved strategies as well as substantial diversity and multifunctionality in host targeting within and between viral species. Prominent modulation of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like and signalling lymphocyte activation molecule families and a number of inhibitory receptors were identified as hubs for viral perturbation, suggesting unrecognized immunoregulatory strategies. We describe a virus-host extracellular interaction map of unprecedented scale that provides new insights into viral immunomodulation."
22267811,Manganese blocks intracellular trafficking of Shiga toxin and protects against Shiga toxicosis.,"Infections with Shiga toxin (STx)-producing bacteria cause more than a million deaths each year and have no definitive treatment. To exert its cytotoxic effect, STx invades cells through retrograde membrane trafficking, escaping the lysosomal degradative pathway. We found that the widely available metal manganese (Mn(2+)) blocked endosome-to-Golgi trafficking of STx and caused its degradation in lysosomes. Mn(2+) targeted the cycling Golgi protein GPP130, which STx bound in control cells during sorting into Golgi-directed endosomal tubules that bypass lysosomes. In tissue culture cells, treatment with Mn(2+) yielded a protection factor of 3800 against STx-induced cell death. Furthermore, mice injected with nontoxic doses of Mn(2+) were completely resistant to a lethal STx challenge. Thus, Mn(2+) may represent a low-cost therapeutic agent for the treatment of STx infections."
25136068,Mycoplasma hyorhinis infection promotes NF-κB-dependent migration of gastric cancer cells.,"Chronic infection of Mycoplasma hyorhinis (M. hyorhinis) has been postulated to be associated with several types of cancer, but its effect on patients' survival and host factors mediating its infection remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that M. hyorhinis p37 protein expression in gastric cancer tissues predicts poor survival and associates with metastasis. M. hyorhinis infects mammalian cells and promotes gastric cancer cell invasiveness via its membrane protein p37. Synthesized peptide corresponding to the N-terminus of p37 prevents M. hyorhinis infection. Host Annexin A2 (ANXA2) interacts with the N-terminus of p37. In addition, EGFR forms a complex with p37 and ANXA2, and is required for M. hyorhinis-induced phosphorylation and membrane recruitment of ANXA2. M. hyorhinis infection is inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ANXA2 or EGFR, but is enhanced by expression of ectopic ANXA2 or EGFR. Downstream of ANXA2 and EGFR, the NF-κB pathway is activated and mediates M. hyorhinis-driven cell migration. In conclusion, our study unveils the effect of M. hyorhinis infection on gastric cancer survival and uncovers the mechanisms by which M. hyorhinis infects mammalian cells and promotes cancer cell migration."
25205096,Critical glycosylated residues in exon three of erythrocyte glycophorin A engage Plasmodium falciparum EBA-175 and define receptor specificity.,"Erythrocyte invasion is an essential step in the pathogenesis of malaria. The erythrocyte binding-like (EBL) family of Plasmodium falciparum proteins recognizes glycophorins (Gp) on erythrocytes and plays a critical role in attachment during invasion. However, the molecular basis for specific receptor recognition by each parasite ligand has remained elusive, as is the case with the ligand/receptor pair P. falciparum EBA-175 (PfEBA-175)/GpA. This is due largely to difficulties in producing properly glycosylated and functional receptors. Here, we developed an expression system to produce recombinant glycosylated and functional GpA, as well as mutations and truncations. We identified the essential binding region and determinants for PfEBA-175 engagement, demonstrated that these determinants are required for the inhibition of parasite growth, and identified the glycans important in mediating the PfEBA-175-GpA interaction. The results suggest that PfEBA-175 engages multiple glycans of GpA encoded by exon 3 and that the presentation of glycans is likely required for high-avidity binding. The absence of exon 3 in GpB and GpE due to a splice site mutation confers specific recognition of GpA by PfEBA-175. We speculate that GpB and GpE may have arisen due to selective pressure to lose the PfEBA-175 binding site in GpA. The expression system described here has wider application for examining other EBL members important in parasite invasion, as well as additional pathogens that recognize glycophorins. The ability to define critical binding determinants in receptor-ligand interactions, as well as a system to genetically manipulate glycosylated receptors, opens new avenues for the design of interventions that disrupt parasite invasion."
23468591,The molecular mechanism of substrate engagement and immunosuppressant inhibition of calcineurin.,"Ser/thr phosphatases dephosphorylate their targets with high specificity, yet the structural and sequence determinants of phosphosite recognition are poorly understood. Calcineurin (CN) is a conserved Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent ser/thr phosphatase and the target of immunosuppressants, FK506 and cyclosporin A (CSA). To investigate CN substrate recognition we used X-ray crystallography, biochemistry, modeling, and in vivo experiments to study A238L, a viral protein inhibitor of CN. We show that A238L competitively inhibits CN by occupying a critical substrate recognition site, while leaving the catalytic center fully accessible. Critically, the 1.7 Å structure of the A238L-CN complex reveals how CN recognizes residues in A238L that are analogous to a substrate motif, ""LxVP."" The structure enabled modeling of a peptide substrate bound to CN, which predicts substrate interactions beyond the catalytic center. Finally, this study establishes that ""LxVP"" sequences and immunosuppressants bind to the identical site on CN. Thus, FK506, CSA, and A238L all prevent ""LxVP""-mediated substrate recognition by CN, highlighting the importance of this interaction for substrate dephosphorylation. Collectively, this work presents the first integrated structural model for substrate selection and dephosphorylation by CN and lays the groundwork for structure-based development of new CN inhibitors."
23576507,Rotavirus-encoded nonstructural protein 1 modulates cellular apoptotic machinery by targeting tumor suppressor protein p53.,"p53, a member of the innate immune system, is triggered under stress to induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Thus, p53 is an important target for viruses, as efficient infection depends on modulation of the host apoptotic machinery. This study focuses on how rotaviruses manipulate intricate p53 signaling for their advantage. Analysis of p53 expression revealed degradation of p53 during initial stages of rotavirus infection. However, in nonstructural protein-1 (NSP1) mutant strain A5-16, p53 degradation was not observed, suggesting a role of NSP1 in this process. This function of NSP1 was independent of its interferon or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT modulation activity since p53 degradation was observed in Vero cells as well as in the presence of PI3K inhibitor. p53 transcript levels remained the same in SA11-infected cells (at 2 to 14 h postinfection), but p53 protein was stabilized only in the presence of MG132, suggesting a posttranslational process. NSP1 interacted with the DNA binding domain of p53, resulting in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of p53. Degradation of p53 during initial stages of infection inhibited apoptosis, as the proapoptotic genes PUMA and Bax were downregulated. During late viral infection, when progeny dissemination is the main objective, the NSP1-p53 interaction was diminished, resulting in restoration of the p53 level, with initiation of proapoptotic signaling ensuing. Overall results highlight the multiple strategies evolved by NSP1 to combat the host immune response."
22238231,Binding of cellular p32 protein to the rubella virus P150 replicase protein via PxxPxR motifs.,"A proline-rich region (PRR) within the rubella virus (RUBV) P150 replicase protein that contains three SH3 domain-binding motifs (PxxPxR) was investigated for its ability to bind cell proteins. Pull-down experiments using a glutathione S-transferase-PRR fusion revealed PxxPxR motif-specific binding with human p32 protein (gC1qR), which could be mediated by either of the first two motifs. This finding was of interest because p32 protein also binds to the RUBV capsid protein. Binding of p32 to P150 was confirmed and was abolished by mutation of the first two motifs. When mutations in the first two motifs were introduced into a RUBV cDNA infectious clone, virus replication was significantly impaired. However, virus RNA synthesis was found to be unaffected, and subsequent immunofluorescence analysis of RUBV-infected cells revealed co-localization of p32 and P150 but little overlap of p32 with RNA replication complexes, indicating that p32 does not participate directly in virus RNA synthesis. Thus, the role of p32 in RUBV replication remains unresolved."
24965446,"Host factors that interact with the pestivirus N-terminal protease, Npro, are components of the ribonucleoprotein complex.","The viral N-terminal protease N(pro) of pestiviruses counteracts cellular antiviral defenses through inhibition of IRF3. Here we used mass spectrometry to identify a new role for N(pro) through its interaction with over 55 associated proteins, mainly ribosomal proteins and ribonucleoproteins, including RNA helicase A (DHX9), Y-box binding protein (YBX1), DDX3, DDX5, eIF3, IGF2BP1, multiple myeloma tumor protein 2, interleukin enhancer binding factor 3 (IEBP3), guanine nucleotide binding protein 3, and polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABP-1). These are components of the translation machinery, ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), and stress granules. Significantly, we found that stress granule formation was inhibited in MDBK cells infected with a noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strain, Kyle. However, ribonucleoproteins binding to N(pro) did not inhibit these proteins from aggregating into stress granules. N(pro) interacted with YBX1 though its TRASH domain, since the mutant C112R protein with an inactive TRASH domain no longer redistributed to stress granules. Interestingly, RNA helicase A and La autoantigen relocated from a nuclear location to form cytoplasmic granules with N(pro). To address a proviral role for N(pro) in RNP granules, we investigated whether N(pro) affected RNA interference (RNAi), since interacting proteins are involved in RISC function during RNA silencing. Using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) silencing with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) followed by Northern blotting of GAPDH, expression of N(pro) had no effect on RNAi silencing activity, contrasting with other viral suppressors of interferon. We propose that N(pro) is involved with virus RNA translation in the cytoplasm for virus particle production, and when translation is inhibited following stress, it redistributes to the replication complex."
24172987,A small GTPase‑like protein fragment of Mycoplasma promotes tumor cell migration and proliferation in vitro via interaction with Rac1 and Stat3.,"The Mycoplasma genus comprises a group of microbes that cause persistent infection in humans and its role in promoting tumor development has long been a concern. Although mixtures of components isolated from Mycoplasma have been shown to activate host Rho family small GTPases and Stat3, no individual factor with this activity has been reported. In the current study, a conserved small GTPase-like protein fragment (SGLP) from Mycoplasma pulmonis chromosome partition protein, Smc, was identified as a virulence factor. SGLP was observed to interact with Rac1 and Stat3. The wild‑type (wt) SGLP, which contains a WxxxE motif, induced activation of Rac1 and phosphorylation of Stat3 at the tyrosine‑705 residue, while the SGLP mutant containing a mutation from WxxxE to AxxxA did not exert the same effects. Moreover, SGLP‑induced Stat3 phosphorylation was observed to be dependent upon Rac1 activity. Furthermore, wt SGLP was observed to promote cell migration and increase bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in HeLa cells and the SGLP mutant did not elicit these effects in HeLa cells. In conclusion, the current observations suggest that SGLP is an important virulence factor of Mycoplasma, which contributes to tumor cell migration and proliferation in vitro via interaction with Rac1 and Stat3."
21808041,Structural basis for the sequence-specific recognition of human ISG15 by the NS1 protein of influenza B virus.,"Interferon-induced ISG15 conjugation plays an important antiviral role against several viruses, including influenza viruses. The NS1 protein of influenza B virus (NS1B) specifically binds only human and nonhuman primate ISG15s and inhibits their conjugation. To elucidate the structural basis for the sequence-specific recognition of human ISG15, we determined the crystal structure of the complex formed between human ISG15 and the N-terminal region of NS1B (NS1B-NTR). The NS1B-NTR homodimer interacts with two ISG15 molecules in the crystal and also in solution. The two ISG15-binding sites on the NS1B-NTR dimer are composed of residues from both chains, namely residues in the RNA-binding domain (RBD) from one chain, and residues in the linker between the RBD and the effector domain from the other chain. The primary contact region of NS1B-NTR on ISG15 is composed of residues at the junction of the N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain and the short linker region between the two Ubl domains, explaining why the sequence of the short linker in human and nonhuman primate ISG15s is essential for the species-specific binding of these ISG15s. In addition, the crystal structure identifies NS1B-NTR binding sites in the N-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15, and shows that there are essentially no contacts with the C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15. Consequently, NS1B-NTR binding to ISG15 would not occlude access of the C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15 to its conjugating enzymes. Nonetheless, transfection assays show that NS1B-NTR binding of ISG15 is responsible for the inhibition of interferon-induced ISG15 conjugation in cells."
20231452,Elongated fibrillar structure of a streptococcal adhesin assembled by the high-affinity association of alpha- and PPII-helices.,"Streptococcus mutans antigen I/II (AgI/II) is a cell surface-localized protein adhesin that interacts with salivary components within the salivary pellicle. AgI/II contributes to virulence and has been studied as an immunological and structural target, but a fundamental understanding of its underlying architecture has been lacking. Here we report a high-resolution (1.8 A) crystal structure of the A(3)VP(1) fragment of S. mutans AgI/II that demonstrates a unique fibrillar form (155 A) through the interaction of two noncontiguous regions in the primary sequence. The A(3) repeat of the alanine-rich domain adopts an extended alpha-helix that intertwines with the P(1) repeat polyproline type II (PPII) helix to form a highly extended stalk-like structure heretofore unseen in prokaryotic or eukaryotic protein structures. Velocity sedimentation studies indicate that full-length AgI/II that contains three A/P repeats extends over 50 nanometers in length. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the high-affinity association between the A(3) and P(1) helices is enthalpically driven. Two distinct binding sites on AgI/II to the host receptor salivary agglutinin (SAG) were identified by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The current crystal structure reveals that AgI/II family proteins are extended fibrillar structures with the number of alanine- and proline-rich repeats determining their length."
22343719,The structural basis of transferrin sequestration by transferrin-binding protein B.,"Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of bacterial meningitis, acquires the essential element iron from the host glycoprotein transferrin during infection through a surface transferrin receptor system composed of proteins TbpA and TbpB. Here we present the crystal structures of TbpB from N. meningitidis in its apo form and in complex with human transferrin. The structure reveals how TbpB sequesters and initiates iron release from human transferrin."
25132548,Structure of malaria invasion protein RH5 with erythrocyte basigin and blocking antibodies.,"Invasion of host erythrocytes is essential to the life cycle of Plasmodium parasites and development of the pathology of malaria. The stages of erythrocyte invasion, including initial contact, apical reorientation, junction formation, and active invagination, are directed by coordinated release of specialized apical organelles and their parasite protein contents. Among these proteins, and central to invasion by all species, are two parasite protein families, the reticulocyte-binding protein homologue (RH) and erythrocyte-binding like proteins, which mediate host-parasite interactions. RH5 from Plasmodium falciparum (PfRH5) is the only member of either family demonstrated to be necessary for erythrocyte invasion in all tested strains, through its interaction with the erythrocyte surface protein basigin (also known as CD147 and EMMPRIN). Antibodies targeting PfRH5 or basigin efficiently block parasite invasion in vitro, making PfRH5 an excellent vaccine candidate. Here we present crystal structures of PfRH5 in complex with basigin and two distinct inhibitory antibodies. PfRH5 adopts a novel fold in which two three-helical bundles come together in a kite-like architecture, presenting binding sites for basigin and inhibitory antibodies at one tip. This provides the first structural insight into erythrocyte binding by the Plasmodium RH protein family and identifies novel inhibitory epitopes to guide design of a new generation of vaccines against the blood-stage parasite."
23851574,The hepatitis B virus preS1 domain hijacks host trafficking proteins by motif mimicry.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an infectious, potentially lethal human pathogen. However, there are no effective therapies for chronic HBV infections. Antiviral development is hampered by the lack of high-resolution structures for essential HBV protein-protein interactions. The interaction between preS1, an HBV surface-protein domain, and its human binding partner, γ2-adaptin, subverts the membrane-trafficking apparatus to mediate virion export. This interaction is a putative drug target. We report here atomic-resolution descriptions of the binding thermodynamics and structural biology of the interaction between preS1 and the EAR domain of γ2-adaptin. NMR, protein engineering, X-ray crystallography and MS showed that preS1 contains multiple γ2-EAR-binding motifs that mimic the membrane-trafficking motifs (and binding modes) of host proteins. These motifs localize together to a relatively rigid, functionally important region of preS1, an intrinsically disordered protein. The preS1-γ2-EAR interaction was relatively weak and efficiently outcompeted by a synthetic peptide. Our data provide the structural road map for developing peptidomimetic antivirals targeting the γ2-EAR-preS1 interaction."
26146184,Molecular Characterization of LubX: Functional Divergence of the U-Box Fold by Legionella pneumophila.,"LubX is part of the large arsenal of effectors in Legionella pneumophila that are translocated into the host cytosol during infection. Despite such unique features as the presence of two U-box motifs and its targeting of another effector SidH, the molecular basis of LubX activity remains poorly understood. Here we show that the N terminus of LubX is able to activate an extended number of ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes including UBE2W, UBEL6, and all tested members of UBE2D and UBE2E families. Crystal structures of LubX alone and in complex with UBE2D2 revealed drastic molecular diversification between the two U-box domains, with only the N-terminal U-box retaining E2 recognition features typical for its eukaryotic counterparts. Extensive mutagenesis followed by functional screening in a yeast model system captured functionally important LubX residues including Arg121, critical for interactions with SidH. Combined, these data provide a new molecular insight into the function of this unique pathogenic factor."
26538390,Haemophilus influenzae Type f Hijacks Vitronectin Using Protein H To Resist Host Innate Immunity and Adhere to Pulmonary Epithelial Cells.,"The incidence of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease has significantly decreased since the introduction of an efficient vaccine against Hib. However, in contrast to Hib, infections caused by H. influenzae serotype f (Hif) are emerging. We recently did a whole genome sequencing of an invasive Hif isolate, and reported that Hif interacts with factor H by expressing protein H (PH). In this study, upon screening with various human complement regulators, we revealed that PH is also a receptor for vitronectin (Vn), an abundant plasma protein that regulates the terminal pathway of the human complement system in addition to being a component of the extracellular matrix. Bacterial Vn binding was significantly reduced when the lph gene encoding PH was deleted in an invasive Hif isolate. The dissociation constant (KD) of the interaction between recombinant PH and Vn was 2.2 μM, as revealed by Biolayer interferometry. We found that PH has different regions for simultaneous interaction with both Vn and factor H, and that it recognized the C-terminal part of Vn (aa 352-362). Importantly, PH-dependent Vn binding resulted in better survival of the wild-type Hif or PH-expressing Escherichia coli when exposed to human serum. Finally, we observed that PH mediated an increased bacterial adherence to alveolar epithelial cells in the presence of Vn. In conclusion, our study reveals that PH most likely plays an important role in Hif pathogenesis by increasing serum resistance and adhesion to the airways."
15294986,Lipopolysaccharide binding protein binds to triacylated and diacylated lipopeptides and mediates innate immune responses.,"LPS binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase protein synthesized predominantly in the liver of the mammalian host. It was first described to bind LPS of Gram-negative bacteria and transfer it via a CD14-enhanced mechanism to a receptor complex including TLR-4 and MD-2, initiating a signal transduction cascade leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines. In recent studies, we found that LBP also mediates cytokine induction caused by compounds derived from Gram-positive bacteria, including lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan fragments. Lipoproteins and lipopeptides have repeatedly been shown to act as potent cytokine inducers, interacting with TLR-2, in synergy with TLR-1 or -6. In this study, we show that these compounds also interact with LBP and CD14. We used triacylated lipopeptides, corresponding to lipoproteins of Borrelia burgdorferi, mycobacteria, and Escherichia coli, as well as diacylated lipopeptides, corresponding to, e.g., 2-kDa macrophage activating lipopeptide of Mycoplasma spp. Activation of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with TLR-2 by both lipopeptides was enhanced by cotransfection of CD14. Responsiveness of human mononuclear cells to these compounds was greatly enhanced in the presence of human LBP. Binding of lipopeptides to LBP as well as competitive inhibition of this interaction by LPS was demonstrated in a microplate assay. Furthermore, we were able to show that LBP transfers lipopeptides to CD14 on human monocytes using FACS analysis. These results support that LBP is a pattern recognition receptor transferring a variety of bacterial ligands including the two major types of lipopeptides to CD14 present in different receptor complexes."
26823170,Host-parasite interaction: multiple sites in the Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38 interact with the erythrocyte receptor band 3.,"Tryptophan-rich antigens of malarial parasites interact with host molecules and play an important role in parasite survival. Merozoite expressed Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38 binds to human erythrocytes and facilitates parasite growth in a heterlologous Plasmodium falciparum culture system. Recently, we identified band 3 in human erythrocytes as one of its receptors, although the receptor-ligand binding mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, using synthetic mutated peptides of PvTRAg38, we show that multiple amino acid residues of its 12 amino acid domain (KWVQWKNDKIRS) at position 197-208 interact with three different ectodomains of band 3 receptor on human erythrocytes. Our findings may help in the design of new therapeutic approaches for malaria."
25293691,Proteolytic processing of the cilium adhesin MHJ_0194 (P123J ) in Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae generates a functionally diverse array of cleavage fragments that bind multiple host molecules.,"Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the aetiological agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia, regulates the presentation of proteins on its cell surface via endoproteolysis, including those of the cilial adhesin P123 (MHJ_0194). These proteolytic cleavage events create functional adhesins that bind to proteoglycans and glycoproteins on the surface of ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells and to the circulatory host molecule plasminogen. Two dominant cleavage events of the P123 preprotein have been previously characterized; however, immunoblotting studies suggest that more complex processing events occur. These extensive processing events are characterized here. The functional significance of the P97 cleavage fragments is also poorly understood. Affinity chromatography using heparin, fibronectin and plasminogen as bait and peptide arrays were used to expand our knowledge of the adhesive capabilities of P123 cleavage fragments and characterize a novel binding motif in the C-terminus of P123. Further, we use immunohistochemistry to examine in vivo, the biological significance of interactions between M. hyopneumoniae and fibronectin and show that M. hyopneumoniae induces fibronectin deposition at the site of infection on the ciliated epithelium. Our data supports the hypothesis that M. hyopneumoniae possesses the molecular machinery to influence key molecular communication pathways in host cells."
18160478,Novel adhesin from Pasteurella multocida that binds to the integrin-binding fibronectin FnIII9-10 repeats.,"Phage display screening with fragmented genomic DNA from the animal pathogen Pasteurella multocida has identified a gene encoding a putative fibronectin binding protein (19). Homologues of this gene (PM1665) are found in all other sequenced members of the Pasteurellaceae. Gene PM1665 has been cloned, and the protein has been expressed. Recombinant PM1665 protein binds to both soluble and immobilized fibronectin and is unique in that it interacts with the integrin-binding fibronectin type III (FnIII) repeats FnIII(9-10) and not, as is the case for almost all other fibronectin adhesins, to the N-terminal type I repeats. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed a complex binding mechanism with a K(D) (equilibrium dissociation constant) of 150 nM +/- 70 nM. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the PM1665 protein contains two helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motifs, and truncation mutation studies have identified the binding site in the protein as a combination of these two HhH motifs in conjunction with a conserved amino acid motif, VNINTA. We have shown that the PM1665 protein is on the cell surface and that binding of P. multocida to fibronectin is almost completely inhibited by anti-PM1665 antiserum. These results support the hypothesis that the PM1665 protein is a member of a new family of fibronectin binding adhesins that are important in the adhesion of P. multocida to fibronectin."
20879998,"Repeat regions R1 and R2 in the P97 paralogue Mhp271 of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae bind heparin, fibronectin and porcine cilia.","Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia, adheres to ciliated respiratory epithelia resulting in ciliostasis and epithelial cell death. The cilium adhesin P97 (Mhp183) contains two repeat regions, designated R1 and R2, that play key roles in adherence. Eight pentapeptide repeats in R1 are sufficient to bind porcine cilia; however, both R1 and R2 are needed to bind heparin. Mhp271, a paralogue of P97, is the only other M. hyopneumoniae protein to contain both R1 and R2 repeats. These repeats are arranged as a set of three pentapeptide repeats (designated R1A₂₇₁), two decapeptide repeats (designated R2₂₇₁), and a second set of six pentapeptide repeats (designated R1B₂₇₁). To determine their function, recombinant proteins containing R1A₂₇₁) (F1₂₇₁) and R2₂₇₁-R1B₂₇₁ (F2₂₇₁) were constructed and used in in vitro binding assays. F2₂₇₁, but not F1₂₇₁, bound heparin (K(D)=8.1 ± 0.4 nM), fibronectin (K(D)=174 ± 13 nM) and porcine cilia. Pre-incubation of F2₂₇₁ with 100 µM heparin blocked cilium binding by ~69%. Cell surface shaving with trypsin combined with two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified Mhp271 as surface-exposed. Our data suggest that both R1 and R2 in Mhp271 are involved in binding to host molecules."
17604025,The temperature activated HtrA protease from pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis acts as both a chaperone and protease at 37 degrees C.,"Characterization of the protease, HtrA, from pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis is presented. The purified recombinant protein was a serine endoprotease, specific for unfolded proteins, and temperature activated above 34 degrees C. Chaperone activity was observed, although this appeared target-dependent. Inactive protease (S247A) was able to chaperone insulin B-chain, irrespective of temperature, but at 30 degrees C only HtrA and not S247A displayed significant chaperone activity for alpha-lactalbumin. These data demonstrate that chaperone activity may involve functional protease domain and that C. trachomatis HtrA functions as both a chaperone and protease at 37 degrees C. These properties are consistent with the developmental cycle of this obligate intracellular bacterium."
20133713,"Neisseria meningitidis GNA2132, a heparin-binding protein that induces protective immunity in humans.","GNA2132 is a Neisseria meningitidis antigen of unknown function, discovered by reverse vaccinology, which has been shown to induce bactericidal antibodies in animal models. Here we show that this antigen induces protective immunity in humans and it is recognized by sera of patients after meningococcal disease. The protein binds heparin in vitro through an Arg-rich region and this property correlates with increased survival of the unencapsulated bacterium in human serum. Furthermore, two proteases, the meningococcal NalP and human lactoferrin, cleave the protein upstream and downstream from the Arg-rich region, respectively. We conclude that GNA2132 is an important protective antigen of N. meningitidis and we propose to rename it, Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA)."
16636286,A yeast assay probes the interaction between botulinum neurotoxin serotype B and its SNARE substrate.,"The seven functionally distinct serotypes (A-G) of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) are dichains consisting of light chain (LC) with zinc-dependent endoprotease activity connected by one disulfide bond to heavy chain with neuronal-cell translocation and receptor-binding domains. LC-mediated proteolysis of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins and consequent inhibition of synaptic vesicle fusion to the presynaptic membrane of human motor neurons are responsible for flaccid paralysis associated with botulism. LC endoproteolysis is complex, requiring highly extended SNARE sequences at the surface of intracellular membranes and prompting our development of a genetically amenable assay to monitor the interaction between BoNT/LC and its SNARE substrate. Using BoNT serotype B as a model, the assay employs a chimeric SNARE protein where a portion of neuronal synaptobrevin (Sb) is fused to Snc2p, a Sb ortholog required for protein secretion from yeast cells. Regulated expression of serotype B-LC in yeast leads to cleavage of the chimera and a conditional growth defect. To assess utility of this assay for monitoring SNARE protein cleavage, we growth-selected chimeric SNARE mutations that inhibited proteolysis. When these mutations were introduced into Sb and examined for cleavage, substrate residues located near and distal to the cleavage site were important, including residues positioned near the Sb transmembrane domain, an unexplored aspect of BoNT cell intoxication. Additional mutations were positioned in a nine-residue SNARE motif, supporting a previously assigned role for this motif in LC recognition and providing proof of principle for the application of yeast-based technology to study intracellular BoNT/LC endoproteases."
24478431,Hijacking of RIG-I signaling proteins into virus-induced cytoplasmic structures correlates with the inhibition of type I interferon responses.,"Recognition of viral pathogens by the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) family results in the activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses. To avoid this response, most viruses have evolved strategies that target different essential steps in the activation of host innate immunity. In this study, we report that the nonstructural protein NSs of the newly described severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a potent inhibitor of IFN responses. The SFTSV NSs protein was found to inhibit the activation of the beta interferon (IFN-β) promoter induced by viral infection and by a RIG-I ligand. Astonishingly, we found that SFTSV NSs interacts with and relocalizes RIG-I, the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) into SFTSV NSs-induced cytoplasmic structures. Interestingly, formation of these SFTSV NSs-induced structures occurred in the absence of the Atg7 gene, a gene essential for autophagy. Furthermore, confocal microscopy studies revealed that these SFTSV NSs-induced structures colocalize with Rab5 but not with Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticulum markers. Altogether, the data suggest that sequestration of RIG-I signaling molecules into endosome-like structures may be the mechanism used by SFTSV to inhibit IFN responses and point toward a novel mechanism for the suppression of IFN responses."
24706939,Viral suppression of innate immunity via spatial isolation of TBK1/IKKε from mitochondrial antiviral platform.,"For antiviral signaling mediated by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), the recruitment of cytosolic RLRs and downstream molecules (such as TBK1 and IKKε) to mitochondrial platform is a central event that facilitates the establishment of host antiviral state. Here, we present an example of viral targeting for immune evasion through spatial isolation of TBK1/IKKε from mitochondrial antiviral platform, which was employed by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a deadly bunyavirus emerging recently. We showed that SFTSV nonstructural protein NSs functions as the interferon (IFN) antagonist, mainly via suppressing TBK1/IKKε-IRF3 signaling. NSs mediates the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs), and the blockage of IB formation impairs IFN-inhibiting activity of NSs. We next demonstrate that IBs are utilized to compartmentalize TBK1/IKKε. The compartmentalization results in spatial isolation of the kinases from mitochondria, and deprived TBK1/IKKε may participate in antiviral complex assembly, leading to the blockage of IFN induction. This study proposes a new role of viral IBs as virus-built 'jail' for imprisoning cellular factors and presents a novel and likely common mechanism of viral immune evasion through spatial isolation of critical signaling molecules from the mitochondrial antiviral platform."
24335286,Evasion of antiviral immunity through sequestering of TBK1/IKKε/IRF3 into viral inclusion bodies.,"Cells are equipped with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as the Toll-like and RIG-I-like receptors that mount innate defenses against viruses. However, viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade or thwart host antiviral responses. Viral inclusion bodies (IBs), which are accumulated aggregates of viral proteins, are commonly formed during the replication of some viruses in infected cells, but their role in viral immune evasion has rarely been explored. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging febrile illness caused by a novel phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae. The SFTS viral nonstructural protein NSs can suppress host beta interferon (IFN-β) responses. NSs can form IBs in infected and transfected cells. Through interaction with tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), viral NSs was able to sequester the IKK complex, including IKKε and IRF3, into IBs, although NSs did not interact with IKKε or IRF3 directly. When cells were infected with influenza A virus, IRF3 was phosphorylated and active phosphorylated IRF3 (p-IRF3) was translocated into the nucleus. In the presence of NSs, IRF3 could still be phosphorylated, but p-IRF3 was trapped in cytoplasmic IBs, resulting in reduced IFN-β induction and enhanced viral replication. Sequestration of the IKK complex and active IRF3 into viral IBs through the interaction of NSs and TBK1 is a novel mechanism for viral evasion of innate immunity."
27049943,Ubiquitination independent of E1 and E2 enzymes by bacterial effectors.,"Signalling by ubiquitination regulates virtually every cellular process in eukaryotes. Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a substrate is catalysed by the E1, E2 and E3 three-enzyme cascade, which links the carboxy terminus of ubiquitin to the ε-amino group of, in most cases, a lysine of the substrate via an isopeptide bond. Given the essential roles of ubiquitination in the regulation of the immune system, it is not surprising that the ubiquitination network is a common target for diverse infectious agents. For example, many bacterial pathogens exploit ubiquitin signalling using virulence factors that function as E3 ligases, deubiquitinases or as enzymes that directly attack ubiquitin. The bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila utilizes approximately 300 effectors that modulate diverse host processes to create a permissive niche for its replication in phagocytes. Here we demonstrate that members of the SidE effector family of L. pneumophila ubiquitinate multiple Rab small GTPases associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, we show that these proteins are capable of catalysing ubiquitination without the need for the E1 and E2 enzymes. A putative mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase motif critical for the ubiquitination activity is also essential for the role of the SidE family in intracellular bacterial replication in a protozoan host. The E1/E2-independent ubiquitination catalysed by these enzymes is energized by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which activates ubiquitin by the formation of ADP-ribosylated ubiquitin. These results establish that ubiquitination can be catalysed by a single enzyme, the activity of which does not require ATP."
24428437,Mutations in the substrate binding site of human heat-shock protein 70 indicate specific interaction with HLA-DR outside the peptide binding groove.,"Heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-peptide complexes are involved in MHC class I- and II-restricted antigen presentation, enabling enhanced activation of T cells. As shown previously, mammalian cytosolic Hsp70 (Hsc70) molecules interact specifically with HLA-DR molecules. This interaction might be of significance as Hsp70 molecules could transfer bound antigenic peptides in a ternary complex into the binding groove of HLA-DR molecules. The present study provides new insights into the distinct interaction of Hsp70 with HLA-DR molecules. Using a quantitative binding assay, it could be demonstrated that a point mutation of amino acids alanine 406 and valine 438 in the substrate binding pocket led to reduced peptide binding compared with the wild-type Hsp70 whereas HLA-DR binding remains unaffected. The removal of the C-terminal lid neither altered the substrate binding capacity nor the Hsp70 binding characteristics to HLA-DR. A truncated variant lacking the nucleotide binding domain showed no binding interactions with HLA-DR. Furthermore, the truncated ATPase subunit of constitutively expressed Hsc70 revealed similar binding affinities to HLA-DR compared with the complete Hsc70. Hence, it can be assumed that the Hsp70-HLA-DR interaction takes place outside the peptide binding groove and is attributed to the ATPase domain of HSP70 molecules. The Hsp70-chaperoned peptides might thereby be directly transferred into the binding groove of HLA-DR, so enabling enhanced presentation of the peptide on antigen-presenting cells and leading to an improved proliferation of responding T cells as shown previously."
